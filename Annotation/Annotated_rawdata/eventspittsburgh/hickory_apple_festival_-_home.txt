We're back!

We are happy to announce the
2024 Hickory Apple Festival will return on October 5th and 6th. You will be able to experience all of your favorites such as live
entertainment, unique crafters, homemade brick oven bread, delicious apple crisp and MORE!  We promise to keep the tight knit feel of our small town and beloved community at the heart of this
event.

The Hickory Apple Festival is
the largest fundraiser for the Mt. Pleasant Twp VFC which services 88 miles of road for ~3,500 residents and a number of businesses. The fire company thrives because of the hard work and dedication
of its members, including the Ladies Auxiliary, and the generous support of the people, businesses, and organizations from the township and nearby communities.
