Top 2024 Moments: Shootout in Cincinnati
Contributing Writer/Editor
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the final installment in a series of articles looking back ay some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
One of the biggest questions surrounding the 2024 Steelers was if the team was capable of winning a shootout against some of the NFL's top offenses.
In a Dec. 1 game at Cincinnati, the Steelers got an opportunity to do just that.
Joe Burrow and the Bengals came into the Week 13 meeting with the Steelers having scored 25 or more points in seven of their 11 games. And with this game taking place in Cincinnati, the Steelers knew they were going to have to attack coming out of the gate.
The Steelers forced a punt on the game's opening possession and went on the attack on their first possession, with Russell Wilson throwing passes on their first four plays and on nine of their first 11.
Unfortunately for the Steelers, the fourth pass was intercepted when Cincinnati's Cam Taylor-Britt threw wide receiver George Pickens to the ground by his head at the line of scrimmage and stepped in front of Wilson's pass intended for the receiver, returning it 51 yards for the game's first score.
But Wilson and company immediately answered, as he quickly moved the Steelers back down the field and threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Pickens to finish off the next possession.
"We wanted to come out and attack, because we knew what they would give us," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "That's what I mean about the depths of these waters in these divisional relationships. It is not checkers — it's chess."
The arial onslaught continued, as Wilson added a 23-yard TD pass to Calvin Austin III and Najee Harris had a 10-yard scoring run, while the Steelers added a pair of late Chris Boswell field goals to take a 27-21 lead into halftime.
Wilson threw his third TD pass in the third quarter, this one to Pat Freiermuth, as he would go on to complete 29 of 38 passes for 414 yards with three touchdowns and one interception in a 44-38 win in which the Steelers led 41-24 when rookie Payton Wilson returned a Burrow fumble 21 yards for a touchdown with 11 minutes remaining in the game.
"It was fun," said Wilson, whose yardage total was the second-most of his 13-year NFL career. "We just had a great time. We knew it was going to be a heavyweight fight."
It was a heavyweight fight won with a massive offense performance.
The Steelers finished with a season-high 520 total yards, as 10 different players caught passes, seven of whom had 29 or more receiving yards.
Najee Harris had 129 total yards, gaining 79 yards on the ground to go along with six receptions for 54 yards.

Working to grow girl's flag football
Steelers.com
The Steelers hosted their fifth annual Girls Flag Football Jamboree on Saturday, a free event to help grow and support youth sports in the Pittsburgh area.
Two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, were held at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, with group one comprised of players in grades 7-9 and group two made up of players in grades 10-12.
Both sessions included everything from the basics to playing games, with drill sessions, skill sessions and breakout games helping those new to the sport develop a love for it and others continue to expand their knowledge and skills.
"We want to grow girl's flag as an organization and a community," said Joe Lofton, the Steelers football development manager. "We want to support Western Pennsylvania football, and this is an opportunity for girls to learn flag football, the fundamentals, but also see how much fun it is to play as a sport."
Since the inception of the jamboree, the interest and excitement from the girls has grown as individuals and at the area high schools, something that is the team's goal.
"The jamborees have grown tremendously," said Lofton. "It started off small and it's grown every year. It's great to see that support from the girls from one school district to another. They support each other, the organization supports the girls.
"Football in general is a fun sport to play, so however we can help we will jump in and do it."
Flag football got a huge boost globally when it was announced as an Olympic Sport for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. It has energized the sport and is introducing it to new audiences.
"It's exciting to see that growth, especially with the Olympics and flag football onboarding for it," said Lofton. "Not only is the whole country excited, we're excited as a city, we're excited as a community and the school districts are excited too. It will really help us grow the sport in 2024.
"A lot of girls are looking for the opportunity, they just haven't had the opportunity to play. Whatever we can do as an organization to support that, we are here to provide that for the girls."
Having the jamboree at the practice facility is something the Steelers always want to do as it opens the doors for the girls to what the game is like for NFL players as well, allowing them to see a completely different side. And it gives Steelers players an opportunity to be on hand to give their support.
"We want them to feel how it feels to be an NFL football player by coming here and having the event," said Lofton. "We want the girls to understand that we support them, and they can use the same facility as our players. We are hoping that gets them excited for their season in the spring.
"Our players have supported this since day one, from legends to current players. All the guys support the girls and flag football and are a part of the growth and opportunity. We all want to see it become a sanctioned sport in Pennsylvania."

Anderson returns to practice
Steelers.com
Offensive tackle Calvin Anderson returned to practice on Tuesday, but remains on the Reserve/Injured List.
Anderson, who was signed by the Steelers in September, was placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Dec. 14. The Steelers have a 21-day window to activate him or he remains on the Reserve/Injured List for the remainder of the postseason.
Anderson, who was originally signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent following the 2019 NFL Draft, has appeared in 46 career games, starting 14. He spent time with the Patriots and New York Jets, before being signed to the Denver Broncos 53-man roster in 2019.
Anderson played in all 16 games in 2020 for the Broncos, starting one at right tackle and one at left tackle. He appeared in 11 games in 2021, starting three, all at left tackle. In 2022, he played in 14 games, starting seven at left tackle for Denver, and allowed just two sacks, with no holding calls.
Anderson signed with the New England Patriots as an unrestricted free agent ahead of the 2023 season. He appeared in five games, starting two, in 2023 before being placed on the Reserve/Injured List where he finished out the season.
Anderson finished his college career at the University of Texas, where he started all 14 games and earned All-Big 12 Conference honors in 2018. He started his college playing days at Rice University, where he played in 36 games and was honorable mention All-Conference USA in 2016 and 2017.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 6
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
RODGER SHAFFER FROM PLUM, PA: Myron Cope was an amazing and unique announcer. Did you get to work with him? What was he like away from the microphone? ANSWER: Myron Cope would have been 96 on Jan. 23, and what appears below is what I wrote for Steelers.com after he died on Feb. 27, 2008. I believe that is the best way to attempt to answer your question:
For a generation of sports fans in Western Pennsylvania, Myron Cope was a voice on their radio, a voice they invited into their homes nightly, a voice they turned to when they wanted to know something about their favorite football team. He was a voice they trusted.
"I've often thought that, when I kick the bucket, there'd be a story that said, 'Creator of towel, dead.'" Cope cracked during the news conference called to announce his retirement on June 21, 2005. "Truthfully, I was gifted and educated to be a writer. I made it as a writer. That is what I was trained to be and that's what I wanted to be. That's what I thought I had a gift for. I would like to be remembered as a pretty decent writer."
Myron Cope died today, Feb. 27, of respiratory failure at the age of 79, and I'm going to honor that request.
As a writer, Cope's talent put him in the company of the best people Sports Illustrated ever had under contract, and as evidence, Cope's profile of Howard Cosell was selected by Sports Illustrated during its 50th Anniversary as one of the 50 best pieces ever published in the magazine.
Cope also was a regular contributor to the "Saturday Evening Post" and "True, The Men's Magazine," and it was in that latter publication that Cope spent days traveling on a train with Cassius Clay in 1962 to do a profile on a man who would become one of the greatest boxers of all time. Clay won the heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston and then changed his name to Muhammad Ali; Cope's piece won the E.P. Dutton Prize in 1963 for "Best Magazine Sportswriting in the Nation."
As a talk-show host, Cope literally was without peer in Pittsburgh, because he was doing it well when nobody else even was attempting it. Cope's talk show aired from 6-8 p.m., five nights a week, on WTAE-AM, and it gained a reputation on the dial as a place to go for good conversation and solid information.
As a color commentator on the Steelers' broadcasts, well, it's impossible to believe anyone could've been more colorful.
And he was good at all of it, because he worked hard at all of it.
Nobody read more than Myron Cope, and everybody returned his telephone calls. Even though he most often is associated with football, Cope didn't give short shrift to the city's other sports. It was common to see Cope racing over to Three Rivers Stadium on a weeknight after his talk show to catch the rest of a Pirates game and then interview the manager and some players in the clubhouse. The same thing happened in the winter, only then Cope's after-show destination was the Civic Arena for a Penguins hockey game, or maybe the Fitzgerald Field House for a Pitt basketball game.
Cope will go down in NFL history as the creator of the Terrible Towel, and over the course of its 30-year existence that magical piece of terrycloth has generated millions of dollars for the Allegheny Valley School, an institution for the profoundly mentally and physically disabled.
Cope had the foresight to trademark the Terrible Towel, and in 1994 he signed over his rights to the trademark to the Allegheny Valley School in perpetuity. After the Steelers won Super Bowl XL, there was a check presentation to the school for the one-year proceeds from sales of the Terrible Towel. The amount of that check was $1 million.
Myron Cope was so good at his craft because nobody out-worked him. He was thorough. He was diligent. And because he was both of those, he also was often right. Cope was so respected that in 1983 he became the first member of the broadcast media to be appointed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame to its Board of Selectors.
But Myron Cope also was one of the guys. He never big-timed the other working stiffs – whether they were newspaper guys or whether they worked in radio or television – even though they essentially were his competitors. He was always ready to buy the next round, or entertain the boys with a story in which he himself often was the foil.
On the day he retired as a broadcaster, he was asked what he believed he accomplished.
"You have to keep perspective," Mr. Cope said at the time. "To me, I'm most proud of my credibility. I have always guarded it. I want people to believe that if I say something, I know what I'm talking about, at least partially, and that is what I believe. I never played devil's advocate on my talk show in the almost 22 years that I had it. I never did because I didn't want to say something and not believe it, so I think people bought me … I was on the alert all the time -- are you being credible, Cope?"
He was being credible. He was being unique. He was being Myron Cope, and we all benefited from that.
JOHN MITCHELL FROM GATES MILLS, OH: Is either Russell Wilson or Justin Fields able to throw the "pump fake" pass? Do you know if the pump fake is coachable, or is a raw talent? Ben Roethlisberger successfully used this approach on what seemed to be a regular basis to both "freeze" defensive backs, as well as add significant unpredictability to a run-heavy offense. ANSWER: What's most necessary to employ pump-fakes is solid protection in the pocket because it takes time for those kinds of routes to develop and the quarterback is going to be holding onto the ball for longer than normal. It never seemed to me that the Steelers were providing the quarterback with that kind of protection on a consistent basis in 2024. And never forget what dynamic talent Ben Roethlisberger embodied throughout his career. Believing something he did routinely could be taught to another player is not necessarily a reasonable expectation, and he was very difficult for the pass-rush to get on the ground.
DARIN FLIPPO FROM JONESBORO, AR: With the NFL season extending into the heart of winter, what are your thoughts on shifting the season to an earlier start date? It seems that playing games in the extreme cold is just bad for all parties involved – teams, staff, and fans. What are your thoughts on the impact weather has on teams who play in outdoor stadiums, particularly those located in colder climates. ANSWER: Moving the entirety of an NFL schedule – training camp, preseason, regular season, playoffs, and the Super Bowl – so that there would be a reduced possibility of exposure to winter is never going to happen, and even if it was to be considered the length of the season would result in more potential exposure to heat, humidity, and lightning on the front end of the schedule.
TOM HOLOWELL FROM CUYAHOGA FALLS, OH: Do you think the Steelers should bring Diontae Johnson back? He could make a difference. ANSWER: That's not something I would do.
JACK SIMS FROM MACOMB, MI: In the Jan. 23 Asked and Answered, you answered a question about the coin toss. I had never heard of the "defend a goal" decision. I always thought the team kicking off got to choose which way they wanted to kick. ANSWER: If the team winning the coin toss elects to receive, the other team automatically will be kicking off and so implicit in that decision is which goal to defend. But there is an option for the team that wins the coin toss to choose a goal to defend, and while that rarely comes into play it could be an option in the case of a game played on a day with a strong wind blowing one way or the other. The 1962 AFL Championship Game was played on Dec. 23, and it matched the Dallas Texans (soon to move to Kansas City to become the Chiefs) vs. the Houston Oilers. The game went into overtime, and the Texans were represented at the overtime coin toss by RB Abner Haynes. The Texans won the toss, and when the referee asked for Haynes' decision, he said, "We'll kick-off toward the clock," because there was a significant wind blowing that way that day. But according to the rules, a team only gets one choice, and Haynes offered two choices to the referee. Only his first choice was accepted, and so the Texans had to kick-off, and the Oilers then got the ball and the wind at their backs. The Texans nevertheless managed to win, 20-17, in double overtime, but Haynes' gaffe is still a cautionary tale today. If the Texans wanted the wind at their backs, Haynes should've told the referee which goal they wanted to defend.
WAYNE JONES FROM DAYTONA BEACH, FL: Can you tell me when a team calls a timeout how the referee determines if it is a full timeout or a 30-second timeout? ANSWER: It's all about the television broadcast, and where the broadcast is in terms of getting the required commercials on the air. If the game has been a free-flowing affair without a lot of stoppages, the break most likely would be a full timeout to give the network time to get more commercials on the air. But if the action had been choppy to that point and there already had been a bunch of commercial breaks, it could be a 30-second timeout. The way it works is the TV truck communicates its needs to an NFL representative on the sideline, and then that representative communicates that to the referee on the field.
KEVIN NEVERLY FROM WEIRTON, WV: Do you think that the Steelers will trade up in the 2025 NFL Draft and sign any available free agents from other teams? ANSWER: The Steelers should enter free agency with enough salary cap space to add players, even some starting-caliber players. As for trading up in the draft, there is a difference in my mind between moving around, back and forth, in some rounds, but if you're referring to a significant move up in the first round from 21st overall, which is where they are set to pick, into the top 5 overall, I would see that as highly unlikely at this point.
JIM ANDERSON FROM TOLEDO, OH: For one of the college playoff games, the coin used for the toss had the logo of each team on the coin. The coin was tossed without the visiting team needing to make a call. The winner of the toss was the team whose logo was showing. This seems like a better way of doing the coin toss because no call needs to be made. Do you think that the NFL would consider doing this? ANSWER: The two-sided coin with the participating teams on it was done – as you wrote – for "one of the college playoff games." There are 544 games in an NFL regular season, and then 25 in the postseason, with those playoff matchups generally not known more than a week in advance. It just doesn't seem like something that's worth the effort for the NFL to try to implement.
JIM SHOOK FROM MOSCOW, ID: Not a football question, but rather an opinion on some of the questions that you are asked. I commend you on doing your very best to answer some of the "stupidest" questions about the Steelers and their roster, when the person is referring to all of the outside noise around the league. You handle each question with grace, dignity, and you use the best language that is possible. I applaud you for your answers. Very professional. ANSWER: Thank you for the kind words.

Let's get to it:
BRADLEY COLLINS FROM LINCOLN, RI: As much as I want Ben Roethlisberger in the Hall of Fame and have little doubt he'll make it there, watching people get passed over makes me wonder. Do you think he's a first-ballot Hall of Famer, or do you think that phrase is overused? ANSWER: I think people are losing a little bit of perspective on the whole concept of "first-ballot Hall of Famer." There are a lot of legends enshrined in Canton who were not inducted in their first year of eligibility. Vince Lombardi and Paul Brown. Mike Ditka and Otto Graham. Wellington Mara. Pete Rozelle. Guys who built the league. And with social media giving everyone a voice, the rush to label someone a "first-ballot Hall of Famer" begins before careers even end. Among a segment of NFL fans, it's assumed that Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce are both "first-ballot Hall of Famers." Travis Kelce is still considered an active player, and Jason Kelce was a center. In the history of the NFL, there are 12 pure centers enshrined in the Hall of Fame, and 10 of them were NOT elected in their first year of eligibility. With the voting rules now requiring 80 percent approval by the Board to get elected, in 2025 only 3 of the 15 Modern Era finalists survived the process and were elected (none of them were in their first year of eligibility).
One of the 2025 first-ballot possibilities was Eli Manning, and there long has been an association with Ben Roethlisberger since both were first-round picks in the 2004 NFL Draft – Manning 1st overall and Roethlisberger 11th overall. Another similarity is that both won 2 Super Bowls, and while Manning was voted MVP in both of those Giants' wins, Roethlisberger has superior statistics in just about every possible category of quarterback play. Manning's regular season record was 117-117-0, while Roethlisberger's was 165-81-1. And for those who don't put a lot of stock into win-loss records in football, Roethlisberger also retired with 8,000 more passing yards, 174 more touchdowns, 33 fewer interceptions, and a passer rating that was 9 points higher. Here are some more of Roethlisberger's qualifications:
• Roethlisberger, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady are the only quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for 60,000 or more yards and win at least two Super Bowls. • He joined Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, and Tom Brady as the only starting quarterbacks in NFL history with at least 160 regular season wins. • Roethlisberger registered his 160th career win in his 238th career start, becoming the third-fastest quarterback to reach 160 wins in NFL history. • In his 18-year career, which included 249 regular-season games (247 starts), Roethlisberger was one of the best passers in NFL history in the fourth quarter and overtime. • In the fourth quarter and overtime, he completed 1,421 passes on 2,196 attempts (64.7 pct.) for 16,860 yards and 120 TDs with 62 interceptions (94.4 passer rating). • Roethlisberger's 16,860 yards passing in the fourth quarter and overtime, alone, nearly ranks among the top-100 overall passers in NFL history. • Roethlisberger threw for 3,000 or more yards in 15 of his 18 NFL seasons. Only Tom Brady (19), Brett Favre (18), Drew Brees (16) and Peyton Manning (16) have more 3,000-yard passing seasons in NFL history. • Roethlisberger rallied the Steelers from a tie or deficit in the fourth quarter 53 times in his regular-season career, which is the most in franchise history and tied for the second-most in NFL history. • Only Peyton Manning (54) had rallied a team from a tie or deficit in the fourth quarter more often. Tom Brady and Drew Brees also registered 53 to tie with Roethlisberger.
It's my opinion that Roethlisberger should be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2027, which is his first year of eligibility. But if he isn't, that in no way diminishes the greatness of his career when he is elected.
JIM ANDERSON FROM TOLEDO, OH: In this year's draft, will the Steelers keep to their policy of drafting the best player available, or do they need to concentrate on position? ANSWER: The whole "best player vs. need" draft debate has evolved into a more nuanced "best player at a position of need" drafting philosophy. Because of free agency, teams have control over the players they draft for 4 years, maybe 5 if the player is a first-round pick and the team elects to exercise its fifth-year option, and so there just isn't a lot of time for long-term development.
JOE LaMOLINARE FROM DALLAS, GA: With Cooper Kupp looking to get out of Los Angeles do you think the Steelers may look at picking him up? ANSWER: I think the Steelers are going to explore a lot of possibilities to add a veteran wide receiver during free agency, and the kind of veteran wide receiver who's a top of the depth chart kind of guy.
TODD GOODING FROM PORTAGE, MI: So the "dynamic kickoff" is a success (limited number of collisions), but the NFL still has live punts and wants to go to an 18-game season. Are the lower concussion dynamic kickoff numbers to help sell the 18 games? ANSWER: Any expansion of the regular season to 18 games must be approved by a vote of the players. If it happens, or when it happens, will be a direct result of the players approving it.
ERIC HUTTINGER FROM DAYTON, OH: I heard something interesting the other day that has me slightly confused. If the Browns trade Myles Garrett, they would still take a more than $30 million cap hit. Does the new team not take that on? ANSWER: If a team would trade for Myles Garrett, that team would assume his contract starting with the 2025 season, but any previous bonuses paid to him by the Browns would have to be accounted for via a dead money assessment on their salary cap. If the trade would happen before the 2025 season starts, the dead money charge to the Browns would be $36.22 million.
DAVID LEWELLEN FROM GLENDALE, WI: You mentioned Chad Brown in a recent column, which reminded me that he made a successful transition from ILB to OLB. Can you explain why that move made sense compared to the ones that many of your submissions suggest? ANSWER: The position Chad Brown played for the Colorado Buffaloes was close to what the Steelers looked for at the time in an outside linebacker in their 3-4, and he actually was moved to inside linebacker after he was drafted in 1993 to get him on the field quicker, because the OLBs at the time were Kevin Greene and Greg Lloyd. Actually, Brown's specific position on the Steelers defense at that time was ROLB, which is what Lloyd played, which is why Chad Brown didn't get to play that until Lloyd tore a patellar in the 1996 regular season opener. And after getting that chance is when Brown posted 13 sacks, made first-team All-Pro, and then signed a big contract in free agency. He was playing "out of position" at ILB, but that was the only way he could get on the field.
GRANT SPELLERBERG FROM CUTLER BAY, FL: In a recent Asked and Answered, you wrote that the defensive line needs serious attention during this offseason. I agree, but watching the Steelers quarterbacks running for their lives, I would say serious attention also should be given to the offensive line. How can they address this with 7 picks? ANSWER: Getting Troy Fautanu back after a year on injured reserve should be a boost to the offensive line in 2025, and maybe they can re-sign Nate Herbig, another IR guy, for depth. The defensive line's need for a talent injection this offseason is much more pronounced, in my opinion.
WILLIAM HEISE FROM SUMTER, SC: How many good players might the Steelers have lost out on if the draft was only 7 rounds before 1976? ANSWER: Starting in 1969 and continuing through the 1970s, DE L.C. Greenwood (4 Super Bowl rings) was a 10th-round pick in 1969; DT Ernie Holmes (2 Super Bowl rings) was an 8th-round pick in 1971; SS-FS Mike Wagner (4 Super Bowl rings) was an 11th-round pick in 1971, QB Joe Gilliam (2 Super Bowl rings) was an 11th-round pick in 1972; and OLB Loren Toews (4 Super Bowl rings) was an 8th-round pick in 1973. That's 16 total rings added after the seventh round of the draft. And that doesn't even take into account Donnie Shell, who was an undrafted rookie in 1974.
ERIC ASH FROM WELLSVILLE, NY: This is for anyone going to see the Steelers in Ireland: my wife and I spent the better part of a week in Dublin a few years ago. The Irish were the friendliest, most helpful, most welcoming people we have encountered in all our travels. It's a great place to visit. ANSWER: I was fortunate enough to have traveled to Dublin with the Steelers in 1997 for the preseason game against the Chicago Bears, and my experience was as positive as yours.

These women made their mark in sports
Steelers.com
Today is a special day in sports.
It's a day to celebrate those who make an impact, on the field and in board rooms, in sports.
It's National Girls & Women in Sports Day (NGWSD), a day that originated in 1987 when it was declared by then President Ronald Reagan. It was originally designated to honor late Olympic volleyball player Flo Hyman and has since evolved to recognize all girls and women in sports in any fashion.
The Steelers are celebrating the women in the organization today, as well as others who are part of the Steelers family.
Several wives of Steelers players have made their mark in the sports world, from playing collegiate to professional sports.
Among those who took youth sports to the next level are Allie Heyward, wife of defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, who played volleyball at Ohio State; Casey Holcomb, wife of linebacker Cole Holcomb, who played field hockey at North Carolina before playing for Team USA; Amy Pickett, wife of quarterback Kenny Pickett, who played soccer at Princeton; and Dani Watt, wife of linebacker T.J. Watt, who played soccer at Wisconsin and went on to play professionally for the Chicago Red Stars and Thróttur Reykjavík, a professional team in Iceland.
All of them shared their take on what they loved about playing sports, the growth of women in sports, girls flag football and much more.
* * *
Playing sports is something almost every kid loves.
But taking that passion to the next level involves commitment. It involves a deep love for what they are doing. It involves sacrifice.
And these women have a passion for sports that drove them to the next level.
"I loved playing college soccer," said Pickett. "It was the pinnacle of what every little girl dreams of, playing soccer in college, at the D-1 level. I was very fortunate to be able to do that. I started playing soccer when I was five years old in munchkin league, the pre-school league, and just loved it. I am grateful to my parents who supported me and helped me live out my dream.
"I started when I was young, became serious in late elementary school, early middle school. I played for my town team, Wall Township, and in middle school decided to take it to the next level and went to play at PDA (Players Development Academy) in North Jersey. My mom would drive me there and from every day. It was training all the time. I used that to get into my dream school and play at the D-1 level. I think playing at the collegiate level is what you work for."
Like Pickett, Holcomb grew up playing sports, but dabbled in a little of everything. But once she was introduced to field hockey, she immediately fell in love and the rest is history. From college to playing for her country, she has done it all.
"I loved the challenge of the sport," said Holcomb. "I grew up playing different sports. I was a multi-sport athlete. When I started playing field hockey in sixth grade it was so different than anything I had ever played. It was almost like a chess game. There was a pressing scheme that I loved and all these hand skills and tricks I loved that challenged me. I loved that the most.
"Playing for my country, too, it was an amazing experience. I never thought I would make it to that level, so when I did it was a crazy moment. I never played with athletes who just gave their all to the sport like they did. Everything was to the next level, and I loved taking my sport to the next level. It was amazing to represent my country. Every time the National Anthem was played, I got chills. I always watched the Olympics with my family growing up, so it was always a dream of mine to play for Team USA and wear red, white and blue. You can't even explain it. To be able to put on the uniform, with the flag, and hear the anthem play, it's just an out of body experience."
Watt's experience took her to new levels as well, from the college game, to playing professionally in the United States, to going internationally to play in a atmosphere that was completely new to her.
"I enjoyed the many lessons it taught me from a young age," said Watt. "Overcoming adversity, traveling a lot. Being independent. I played professionally in another country and that was so different than playing in our own country, or in college. They don't speak the same language as you, everything is unfamiliar. Figuring that out as well as playing for fans of another country.
"It taught me so many things that I used throughout my entire career, as well as after. I developed so many friendships. There was so much growth, personally, physically, mentally, that sports taught me.
"It allowed me to find out who I was at my core. It was a strong bond I had with the sport. It was almost like a relationship with a person where you go through valleys and mountains with the sport. But it was also what got me through whatever it was I was going through. It was my escape. It was everything. Your whole life revolves around it, for me almost since I was a child. It taught me a lot of lessons and made me value a way of life even after playing."
Pickett, who balanced an Ivy League education while playing in college, still uses those balancing skills in her everyday life.
"I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have sports in my life, whether it was college or youth," said Pickett. "I think it shapes young individuals, young women, with these intangible characteristics that carry you through a lifetime. Not just the bonds with your teammates, but the character skills that you develop. Whether that is work ethic, tenacity, trust, bravery, courage, the ability to stick up for yourself. The ability to pick yourself up when you are down. How to lead a team, be a friend, compete. More than anything it's those character traits that brought me through it."
As a mother of three kids, including two daughters, who have varying levels on interest in sports, Heyward is grateful for how her time playing at Ohio State helped her with balancing life as a wife and mom.
"The biggest takeaway was having a strong work ethic and time management," said Heyward. "Getting through those four years, now I can get through anything.
"The camaraderie and the friendships with the teammates were also amazing. They become part of your family. That was another amazing piece. You aren't just going to school and are this single person stepping into this big new world. You are stepping into this already built family. That was an incredible blessing to have.
"Now that I am done, I'm able to look back and say, wow, I am so proud I did that. That is such a small group of people that can say they did that."
While it hasn't been long since their playing days have ended, women's sports continue to grow and develop in today's climate and it's something these former athletes welcome with open arms.
"I love seeing the continued development of women's sports," said Watt. "It's exciting for girls to have more role models in sports and in general. Being an athlete helps you to develop these traits that I want every little girl to have.
"I love celebrating women in sports. There should be more awareness around it. Mostly to inspire and encourage others. We came from that lifestyle, so we know the importance. Sometimes little girls need to be told that. That is why we do it. For me, I celebrate women in sports every day."
And that is the key for all of them. While having National Girls & Women in Sports Day is important, making it the norm and celebrating every day is the key.
"To see things improving, makes me happy for future women and girls that will grow up and have more of an opportunity to succeed in women's sports than maybe people in my generation did or people playing now even," said Watt. "There is a long way to go, but we are making strides. The more we bring awareness to that, the more people have an understanding of women's sports, we can make a push for greater success for women's sports in the United States."
One sport that continues to grow in popularity in the United States and beyond is flag football. It is now officially an Olympic sport, as well as one the wives wish they would have had an opportunity to play.
"I am jealous," said Pickett. "I wish they would have had that when I was a kid. I love seeing it. The smiles on these girls' faces are priceless. I think it's such a great way to get girls involved in the game, get girls active. Especially girls who have brothers who play the sport, and they see them bonding over football and they want to be a part of it. Girls who love the game. I loved playing with the girls in my neighborhood, or my family on Thanksgiving. Now it's an organized activity. I am really excited for what the future holds for girls flag football."
The Steelers, along with the Philadelphia Eagles, are working toward getting girls flag football as a sanctioned sport in high schools in Pennsylvania, something that is happening around the country.
"That would be incredible," said Watt. "I would stand so firm behind that. People are going to be involved in what is offered to them. If there is a passion for football, and as a girl you don't have an opportunity to play it, it's difficult. It would be a huge stride in women's sports in general if flag football at the high school level would be a full-time sport.
"I would have done it when I was in high school. I loved it. All we were able to do was play flag football the week of homecoming with your class. It's about encouraging people to be active and do what you love. It's the same sport, the schools should offer it. There is no reason not to have it. I think it would be great if there is a future in that for the women."
Holcomb said when she was younger, she always wanted to play football, even with the boys, and would have welcomed the opportunity to play flag football.
"I think it's great more and more girls are dabbling in football, especially flag football," said Holcomb. "I love the sport. I think it's so much fun. It's one of the more challenging sports. It's exciting to see them want to give football more of a chance."

Defensive line takes center stage at NFL Scouting Combine
INDIANAPOLIS - One of the conundrums faced by teams when it comes to drafting defensive tackles is if the player is really good at stopping the run, can he also give a team enough as a pass rusher to now allow himself to be taken out of a game?
For example, as good as former Steelers nose tackle Casey Hampton was against the run, opponents could dictate how much he played in a game simply by going to three wide receiver sets and forcing the Steelers to match their wide receivers on the field with a nickel defense.
Finding a nose tackle who also has pass rushing ability is key. The Steelers had that in Javon Hargrove, whom they selected in the third round of the 2016 NFL Draft.
They feel they could have that in 2023 second-round draft pick Keeanu Benton, who has manned the team's nose tackle position the past two seasons.
But adding another player to that equation who might allow Benton to perhaps become a defensive end and not be forced to play nose tackle could be something in which the Steelers are interested in accomplishing in the 2025 NFL Draft.
Fortunately, this particular draft has a number of players who might offer that prospect.
"This is a really good draft for the defensive line," Steelers general manager Omar Khan said.
And topping the list of players who might step in and make an immediate impact for the Steelers is Michigan defensive tackle Kenneth Grant.
A 6-foot-3, 342-pound defensive lineman, Grant offers the flexibility to have the size and run-stuffing ability to be a true nose tackle, while also offering enough athleticism to rush the passer situationally. Grant had 6.5 sacks the past two seasons for the Wolverines.
"I'm a 3-down player for sure," Grant said here Wednesday at the NFL Scouting Combine. "I can rush the passer with my strength and a little bit of finesse in there. Most guys think I'm just a run-stopper, but I'm super athletic and can rush the passer."
He'll get an opportunity to put that athleticism on display Thursday when the defensive linemen take the field at Lucas Oil Stadium for their on-field workouts.
The Steelers haven't selected a defensive lineman in the first round of the draft since taking Cam Heyward with the 31st pick in 2011. If they want a player such as Grant, they would likely have to take him with their first-round pick this year, which is 21st – if he lasts that long.
"I met with the Steelers," Grant said of his interviews here in Indianapolis. "Very serious. They want competitors. They want dudes that are ready to go."
Another such player in whom the Steelers showed interest is Oregon defensive tackle Derrick Harmon.
Harmon (6-5, 310 pounds) transferred from Michigan State to Oregon last season and recorded 45 tackles and 5 sacks.
Also considered a first-round talent, he also had a formal meeting with the Steelers and head coach Mike Tomlin here.
"That's a great guy," Harmon said of Tomlin. "That's a guy you can sit down and have an hour talk with, two hour talk with, talk ball, talk live. Just a great guy to talk to."
Those are two potential first-round defensive tackles, while Walter Nolen of Mississippi and Michigan's Mason Graham also fall into that category. Beyond that, as Khan said, the draft is deep with defensive line prospects.

NFL.com draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said he has 24 defensive linemen available this year whom he has graded as potential starters. Last year, that number was 12.
With Heyward now 35 and the way the Steelers finished the season, allowing more than 200 yards rushing to the Ravens in a late season loss and then again in the postseason, adding defensive line depth is a must.
"It starts with stopping the run, and we didn't do that down the stretch," team president Art Rooney II said at his season-ending press conference. "We need to figure out how we get stronger. Hopefully with a defensive front."

Triple Take: Ranking the top 2025 RBs in the Draft
The Triple Take crew of Dale Lolley, Matt Williamson and Mike Prisuta take a look at the top prospects in the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft, which will be held in April. Today, they delve into the running back position.
The opinions expressed here are their own and not those of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Dale's Take
We might be able to call the 2024 season the year of the running back. A number of big-name running backs changed teams in the offseason, including the Eagles adding Saquon Barkley and the Ravens signing Derrick Henry.
There were others who also changed teams with success, as NFL teams made the most of free agency because the NFL Draft wasn't deep with running backs.
This year, however, things look a little different. In fact, ESPN's Mel Kiper is on record as saying he has more than 30 running backs with draftable grades available this year.
Boise State's Ashton Jenty leads the way, but is hardly the only high-quality runner available. And they come in all shapes and sizes.
Dale's Rankings
1. Ashton Jenty, Boise State, 5-8 1/2, 211 lbs. - An elite talent at the college level, Jenty quite literally carried Boise State into the college playoffs. He's an explosive, high-volume runner. Some might be scared away by his heavy workload, but Jenty was injury-free in college. He's tough and physical with breakaway ability.
2. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Teams looking for the next Jamhyr Gibbs might look to Henderson earlier than we might think in this draft. He's a home-run hitter with good hands. While Henderson isn't the biggest back, he's outstanding in pass protection, a key ingredient to early playing time.
3. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton has good speed and runs with an aggressive nature. He runs extremely hard, sometimes to his own detriment. He could slow things down a bit to pick his holes better, but he has enough speed to outrun defenders and barrel over those he doesn't.
4. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State, 5-11 5/8, 221 lbs. - A hard-nosed runner who catches the ball well out of the backfield, Judkins has the power to run inside and the patience to get outside on zone runs. The sub-4.5 40 speed he showed off at the NFL Scouting Combine doesn't hurt, either.
5. Cam Skattebo, Arizona State, 5-9 1/2, 219 lbs. - For a player without home-run speed, Skattebo breaks off a lot of long runs because of his excellent contact balance. He's impossible to get on the ground. But that running style also leads to Skattebo taking a lot of punishment. He's very good in the passing game, as well.
Sleeper: Damien Martinez, Miami (Fla.), 5-11 5/8, 217 lbs – Martinez was the Pac-12 Offensive Rookie of the Year at Oregon State and a 1,000-yard season as a true sophomore before transferring to Miami, where he posted another 1,000-yard season. With his size, he's the bruising runner you'd expect. But he also averaged more than 6 yards per carry in each of his three college seasons, has good contact balance and is a solid pass protector. He looks NFL ready to be the thunder portion of an NFL committee, with the potential to be an every-down back.
Matt's Take
This is a truly exceptional running back class and could be the strongest position group in this entire draft class. This group of running backs has a true superstar at the top of the list, plenty of projectable starters at the next level, great depth all through the entire draft, and a very wide variety of players at this position. The 2025 running back group has someone for everyone, but as the draft goes along, it might also provide excellent value on the third day of the draft. In fact, don't be surprised if several undrafted players at this position go on to have very successful NFL careers.
Matt's Rankings
1. Ashton Jeanty, Boise State, 5-8 1/2, 211 lbs. - J eanty is a rare and elite running back prospect-two terms that get thrown around way too much when evaluating draft prospects. There is a case that this is the best player in the 2025 NFL Draft. He's the total package with gaudy production, particularly after first contact. * 
2. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, * 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton is a big back with great bit play abilities as both a runner and receiver who runs away from defenders in the open field. This is a very physical downhill runner that delivers an awful lot of contact. His pass protection skills could use more work and Hampton isn't the shiftiest guy in this class, but he projects as a feature back at the next level.
3. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Henderson was fantastic in the college playoffs this season and is a big play waiting to happen every time he touches the football. While he probably doesn't project to a high-carry workhorse role in the league, Henderson will give his new team an immediate jolt. Henderson has good size for a back with his dynamism while also excelling in pass protection.
4. Kaleb Johnson, Iowa, 6-1, 224 lbs. - Johnson is coming off a big season for the Hawkeyes. He is extremely well built but can run a little bit high at times. Johnson has very good vision and patience and is best suited for a predominantly zone scheme. He is somewhat of a linear athlete, but Johnson has very good long speed for a back his size. 5. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State, 5-11 5/8, 221 lbs. - Judkins and Henderson made for an outstanding one two punch in the National Champions backfield this season with their complementary styles. Judkins is much more of a banger than Henderson with great aggression but isn't in Henderson's realm in terms of breakaway speed.
Sleeper: Jordan James, Oregon, 5-9 1/2, 205 lbs. - Oregon is a major college football program so it isn't like their top running back is a true sleeper that would fall through the cracks. But James backed up Bucky Irving (who went on to have an exceptional rookie season) a year ago, making James just a one-year starter and therefore, doesn't have as many carries at the college level as many of these prospects. James has excellent vision and contact balance but is somewhat limited thus far as a receiver. James has a low center of gravity and runs with aggression without compromising big play ability. He is best in a gap scheme, but also shows excellent potential as a zone runner.
Mike's Take
NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah's expectation is the upcoming NFL Draft will include a "Day 2 bonanza" of selections at running back.
And for teams that perceive themselves to be a running back away, it may not be necessary to wait.
"Once you have the building blocks in place, Detroit's the great example," Jeremiah said during coverage of the NFL Scouting Combine, recalling the Lions' bold stroke at 12th overall in 2023. "You didn't take Jahmyr Gibbs too high at that position, he's ready to come in and have an impact.
"You're seeing investment in the free-agency side but you're now gonna see it with draft capital, as well."
Running backs may, indeed, be back in style.
High-impact free-agent additions last season such as Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry, to name two, may have reminded teams what the right back in the right place at the right time is capable of in terms of inflicting damage.
Barkley's 60-yard touchdown run on the first offensive snap in the Eagles' postseason blowout of the Commanders was cited by NFL Network analyst Charles Davis as one such example.
"These types of plays, they're like bolts of lightning and they go throughout teams and I'm glad we're starting to get the running back back in the game."
More are most definitely on the way.
This year's class is deep and talented, and it's the fastest bunch of running backs in the 40-yard dash (4.48) since position group averages were first tracked at a Combine in 2003.
There's tape and production and measurables aplenty.
It might come down to personal preference in terms of how they're stacked from team to team.
Even at the top in the wake of the performance North Carolina's Omarion Hampton put on at the Combine, one that may have significantly narrowed the perceived gap between Boise State's Ashton Jeanty and everyone else at the position.
"Everyone's assuming that Jeanty's going to be the first one," the NFL Network's Peter Schrager said. "But I've been around this draft, I saw Edgerrin James (fourth overall in 1999) go before Ricky Williams (fifth overall in 1999). We've seen Jahmyr Gibbs go just (about) as high as Bijan Robinson (eighth overall in 2023)
"I wonder if Hampton helped his stock enough, for now, to debate who's the first running back off the board."
Mike's Rankings
1. Ashton Jeanty, Boise State (5-8 1/2, 211 lbs.) - His 2024 numbers were absurd (374 carries, 2,601 rushing yards, a 7.0 average and 29 touchdowns) but the way Jeanty went about collecting them was just as impressive. On one run in particular, Jeanty broke six tackles on what became a 10-yard gain against Penn State in the College Football Playoff. When he wasn't doing that type of stuff, he was hitting home runs.
2. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina (5-11 3/4, 221 lbs.) - Hampton is one of three backs in this Top 5 list that tips the scales at over 220 pounds. He's rushed for 15 touchdowns in each of the last two seasons and gained a combined 3,164 yards on the ground. And his attention-getting performance in Indianapolis included a 4.46 in the 40-yard dash.
3. Kaleb Johnson, Iowa (6-1, 224 lbs.) - Johnson checks in ahead of both members of Ohio State's dynamic duo on this list, it part because it had to be harder to run for 1,537 yards and 21 touchdowns for the Hawkeyes, who were otherwise offensively challenged, than it was to put up numbers for the Buckeyes, who parlayed their array of offensive riches into a national championship.
4. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State (5-11 5/8, 221 lbs.) - Judkins is the bigger Buckeye. But his 121 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns on 13 touches, including a 70-yard run, in National Championship Game against Notre Dame emphasized how explosive Judkins can become.
5. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State (5-10 1/8, 202 lbs.) - Henderson is a complete package, albeit a little bit of a smaller one than his OSU teammate. One of Henderson's most significant contributions against the Irish for all the marbles was a blitz pick-up on the deep ball that helped seal the deal.
Sleeper: Woody Marks, USC (5-101/8, 207 lbs.) - Marks lacks the size and speed available throughout the class, but he caught 83 passes in 2021 at Mississippi State, where he was once described by his former coach Mike Leach as "tougher than boot leather." Marks registered 261 career receptions in four years at Mississippi State and one at USC, many of the highlight-reel variety. He also rushed for 1,133 yards last season at USC. He might prove to be a late-round keeper as a third-down/complementary back.

Showing their love for the Steelers
Steelers.com
Steelers Nation turned out in full force on Sunday to cheer on the black and gold, and it wasn't just in the Washington area by a long shot.
The team hosted their annual "Siempre Steelers" Watch Party in Mexico, holding it in the city of Monterrey for the first time. In 2022 & 2023, the team held the event in Mexico City.
Over 2,000 fans packed the Showcenter arena in downtown Monterrey, with Terrible Towels waving for a thrilling afternoon of football, with scenes from the party featured on the CBS game broadcast in the United States, as well as on several of the NFL's partner networks in Mexico.
Steelers legends Dermontti Dawson, Jeff Hartings, Carnell Lake and Kordell Stewart were on hand, signing autographs, posing for pictures and enjoying the event as much as the fans were.
"We are so grateful for the incredible amount of support we receive, not only here in Monterrey, but anytime we visit Mexico," said Stewart, who also attended last year's Watch Party in Mexico City. "Seeing all these fans and all these Terrible Towels twirling was amazing. A big shout out to all the fans who came to the Watch Party at the Showcenter."
Monterrey y Washington son Steelers Country 🫡🇲🇽 #HereWeGo | @nflmx pic.twitter.com/UyiwpTewxW
In what has become a tradition at the team's international watch parties, the feel of the day was similar to the atmosphere at Acrisure Stadium for a home game. Fans were able to enjoy live music and entertainment, purchase official Steelers merchandise, and game day content that is shown in-stadium in Pittsburgh was featured as well. There were also football-themed games and activities for kids and adults as well.
"We had an amazing day with a huge number of fans here in Monterrey," said Dawson. "I've been fortunate enough to visit Mexico a number of times in my career, and no matter where we go, it never ceases to amaze me the level of support from Steelers Nation in Mexico."
The Steelers Spanish language audio team, which includes Alvaro Martin and Arturo Carlos, held their broadcast at the party as part of a simulcast with the television broadcast of the game. Two-time Super Bowl winning kicker Raul Allegre, who is a native of Mexico, joined the broadcast as a special guest.
The excitement reached a fever pitch as the game came down to the wire, with the fans waving towels as the Steelers secured the win.

Steelers to play in NFL's first regular season game in Ireland in '25
The National Football League will play its first-ever regular season game in Dublin, Ireland in 2025, the league announced on Friday, and the Pittsburgh Steelers will play as the designated team in the historic game.
The 2025 NFL Dublin game will take place at Croke Park - the largest sporting arena in Ireland and headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) - in partnership with the Government of Ireland and Dublin City Council (Dublin City).
Steelers' President Art Rooney II and his family have a rich history and deep connection with the Island of Ireland, having family from Newry, County Down. The late Steelers Chairman Daniel M. Rooney, Art Rooney's father, served as U.S. Ambassador to Ireland from 2009-2012 and was a co-founder of the Ireland Funds charity.
The Steelers are also one of only two NFL teams to have played a game in Ireland to date, a preseason matchup in 1997 against the Chicago Bears at Croke Park as part of the American Bowl series.
More information:
"We are delighted to officially bring a regular season NFL game to Ireland as part of our 2025 International Games slate," said Executive Vice President International, League Events and Club Business at the NFL Peter O'Reilly. "Both the NFL and the Steelers franchise have deep roots and history in Ireland, and we're looking forward to making our regular-season debut in Dublin, bringing our game to a large and passionate Irish fan base and underlining the NFL's commitment to global growth."
"We are very excited to be the designated team in the first regular season game to be played in Ireland this upcoming season," said Steelers' President Art Rooney II. "The opportunity for the Pittsburgh Steelers to play in Ireland is truly special, not only because of the Rooney family history there, but also to play in front of the growing number of Steelers fans in Ireland. We are thrilled to be part of this historic event to represent Pittsburgh in a game that brings the NFL to the great sports fans in Ireland."
"This is a major vote of confidence in Ireland's ability to host world class events and in Dublin's reputation as one of the most welcoming cities in the world," said Minister for Arts, Media, Communications, Culture and Sport Patrick O'Donovan TD. "Hosting a regular season NFL game in 2025 will have huge benefits for Irish tourism, the wider economy and our sports ecosystem. It will also build upon the deep cultural, family and economic ties between Ireland and the United States. I look forward to welcoming thousands of American football fans from the U.S., Europe and further afield to our shores for this historic game, and also to the ongoing collaboration with the NFL, Sport Ireland and American Football Ireland to grow American football participation in Ireland, both the tackle and flag format of the game, as part of the government's commitment to increasing the number of people regularly participating in sport and physical activity."
Croke Park has played host to many iconic sporting moments. It is the home of the GAA, All-Ireland Finals for Gaelic football and hurling, the 2023 Special Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies and in 1996 it held the college football game between Notre Dame and the Navy. In addition to its sporting heritage, the venue has welcomed global music icons including U2, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and Taylor Swift.
"We are absolutely delighted to welcome the NFL and the Pittsburgh Steelers to Croke Park," said GAA President, Jarlath Burns. "This event will not only highlight our stadium's world-class facilities but also reinforce the connections and love of sport shared between our communities. Croke Park is a proud symbol of Ireland's rich sporting heritage, and hosting one of the world's best sporting organizations is a momentous occasion for the entire country. It will be a special and unique event, celebrating the passion uniting two great sporting codes in the heart of Dublin."
The full matchup including opposition, date and kickoff time will be announced by the NFL when the 2025 NFL schedule is revealed this spring.
In addition, the Steelers are excited to announce plans for a four-year partnership with Aer Lingus, establishing the airline as An Official Airline of the Pittsburgh Steelers, A Founding Partner of Steelers Ireland, The Official Airline of Steelers Ireland, and The Presenting Partner of Steelers Ireland 2025. More details regarding the partnership will be announced by Aer Lingus.

Speed on display at the Combine
Steelers.com
Turning on the afterburners: Kentucky cornerback Maxwell Hairston lit it up in the 40-yard dash, turning in a 4.28 on his second run of the day.
Hairston came out of the gate with a 4.30 on his first run and heard plenty of cheers from the crowd, but you could immediately see the disappointment on his face.
"That's the look of a man who knows he can go faster," said NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah.
Hairston walked away from the first attempt shaking his head, knowing he didn't run his best.
And he shared as much afterwards.
"I asked him if it was good enough. I knew the answer," said NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales. "He said no, it ain't enough.
"Keep this in mind. He trains at the same EXOS facility as (Chiefs) Xavier Worthy out in Phoenix. When we asked him this week what he thinks about when he thinks about the combine, he said Xavier Worthy with his 4.21 record setting run last year. He told us he is going to put on a show today."
ESPN's Pat McAfee, who was joining Jeremiah and Rich Eisen in the booth during Maxwell's run, immediately pointed out something in his start.
"The first steps there he went to the left instead of staying straight," said McAfee. "I am no draft expert, but he knows he can run faster."
And that he did.
On his second run, Maxwell got out of the gate strong and ran an official 4.28, after his unofficial time showed as a 4.29.
"That is a great feeling," said Jeremiah. "Not only is that fast, but when you can hear the audible 'oohs and aahs' from the crowd or that sub 4.3 time, I love it."
The reaction from Maxwell was night and day from the first run. While he showed disappointment after the first run, he showed nothing but elation from the second run.
"It's amazing what 1/100th of a second will do," said Eisen. "The 4.3 flat he was shaking his head, the (unofficial) 4.29 he got the crowd going and all of his Group 4 friends celebrating."
He said his goal was to go a little faster, and at the time everyone thought it was a 4.29. But when the results came from the NFL, he did hit his 4.28 goal.
"He is so pumped. This is what the Combine is all about," Dales shared. "He wanted a 4.28. That was his target training for this thing. He ended up with an unofficial 4.29. He said the start was much more aggressive than his first run. He was aggressive with his arms through the dry phase.
"He took me through each phase, and he said at the end I just cut it loose like somebody was chasing me down.
"The smile on this guy's face, I'm telling you what, the feedback on this player this week, and you spend just 10 seconds with him, you are right in his camp. Great job by this young man."
Once the numbers were in, he got exactly what he wanted – a 4.28 40-yard time.

Kentucky cornerback Maxwell Hairston just reached a top speed of 24.25 mph on his second forty run (4.29u), the fifth-fastest speed reached by a player at the Combine over the last three years and second-fastest by a CB. 📊: https://t.co/p64vRez1Gn 🌩️: Powered by @awscloud pic.twitter.com/wuGcyBsUJr
His own drill: One of the drills the defensive backs went through at the Combine is the Teryl Austin drill, named after the Steelers defensive coordinator who created it.
In the drill, the player starts to move in one direction, then quickly turns and finds the ball going to the other side of the field.
The drill requires 'anticipation and recovery speed and shows how a defensive back can move laterally in space under pressure.'
Steelers fan in the house: The Combine is an opportunity for fans across the country to tune into NFL Network and catch all of the action, but it's also an opportunity for fans to attend in person.
And there were some Steelers fans on hand taking in all the action and getting some prime coverage on NFL Network.
Lucy Callery took a half day off school on Friday to drive with her dad, Chad Callery, from Kentucky for a few days of watching drills in Indianapolis. The young Callery had her stopwatch out to get the 40-times, while dad recorded them in a notebook for her.
"She is dialed in," said Eisen.
She even got props from Jeremiah for the quality of the stopwatch she had, knowing it was top notch and she wasn't messing around.
This is the third time Lucy has been to the Combine, and she also has visited the team at Saint Vincent College for training camp, even getting her picture taken with Cameron Heyward while sporting her Heyward jersey.

Safety valve: South Carolina safety Nick Emmanwori put on a show at the Combine, showing what he is capable of and exceeding his goals in multiple areas.
"Nick Emmanwori s having a day," said Dales. "I watched him on the vertical with the 43.0". He wanted a 40.0, so he exceeded that. Broad jump, he wanted an 11'02 he told me, so he exceeded that with 11'06. Now for the 40, he wanted a 4.3 or somewhere in that, so he's sitting on a 4.38.
"I think what's interesting about him is when you stand with him, he's 6-3, 220 pounds. He looks about 6-5. People ask is he a guy that should move to linebacker. And he said, no, that is not the consensus. So, people love his size at a safety spot and they're almost amazed at how he moves at that size. It's really fascinating because he's so large of a human being."
Emmanwori has drawn comparisons to Steelers Hall of Fame safety Troy Polamalu, something that means a lot to him.
"He has a lot of high energy," said Emmanwori of Polamalu. "His motor... crazy motor, crazy player, real physical. I remember seeing him catching a pick [while] guarding the seven route. He's just an all-around dude."

Knowing what to expect: Cornerback Jahdae Barron doesn't have to look far for someone to give him an idea of what to expect in the NFL, as his former teammate in the University of Texas secondary is happy to help.
Barron, who ran a 4.39 40-yard dash on Friday, played alongside Steelers cornerback Ryan Watts, who spent his rookie season on the Reserve/Injured List.
Like Watts, Barron also played a hybrid role at Texas, with the ability to move around and step in where needed.
"Me and Ryan we're different sizes, but when I played the boundary, I watched a lot of his tape, his movement on how he attacks," said Barron. "Ryan was very smart with his tactics, just showing different looks and playing something else. Ryan was a big physical corner. I'm not as big as Ryan, but I do take that aspect of being physical."
With fellow top cornerbacks Travis Hunter and Will Johnson opting to not take part in the Combine on-field workouts, Barron had the opportunity to shine on Friday night. And he didn't hold back.
"(I want teams to see) that I'm just dialed in," said Barron. "I pay attention to my craft and execute at a high pace. Everything I did in the past led me here to this point."
Barron is willing to do whatever teams ask, including the Steelers who had a meeting him. That could include playing cornerback, or safety in some cases.
"A few teams have talked to me about playing safety, either nickel or just with run fits," said Barron. "It's all been a blessing. A lot of teams asked me which I preferred. I told them I want to play all of them. It always was beneficial to me.
"(Texas secondary) Coach (Terry) Joseph taught me if I could know all of them, I'd have a better understanding of what everybody's job was supposed to be, when I was at different positions, knowing everybody's responsibilities. It allowed me to play much faster, knowing his point was A to B and my point was C to D. Things like that. I put it together and made it my little chess game."
Knowing that football is a chess game, Barron has worked on several things, and he has seen results through his college career.
"I do a lot of great things," said Barron. "I'd say a weakness I had was blind spots, just allowing people in my blind spots, not understanding I have to get better width first and better depth to allow people not to get in my blind spots. Coach Joseph helped me with that later on in the season. Another thing he also added if any doubts or anyone did get in my blind spot just speed turning and getting back in position.
"Then for positives, that really improved my game week in and week out. Something Coach Joseph taught me as well was red light, yellow light and green light. Red light was a tempo thing. A quarterback would get in his drop and if he didn't move, if he stood right there in shotgun, that was a red light. That was an indicator for run-RPO. Yellow light was a four-five-yard drop, typically you'll get a deeper glance, eight-yard hitches and things like that. Green light was quarterback drop was six-to-seven. That's when you get your shots. You'll get 15 yards and above, you'll get big posts, big comebacks, digs and things like that. So, me being able to see that was amazing for me. It allowed me to play fast and learn the route concepts. If you understand the route concepts from red to yellow to green light, I could have went out there honestly without getting a defensive call and still played football.
"Once I really dialed in on that, understanding the quarterback's drop. A quarterback is not going to throw a big post just standing there as soon as he catches the snap. It doesn't work like that. He has to get a drop to be able to release that ball to the post. Also understanding a lot of things with the O-line. So, me playing the simplest things in my head when the play would start made me be efficient throughout the play."
No time to rest: There is no lack of talent in the secondary in the 2025 NFL Draft, including at the top of the list where Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter from Colorado is ranked as one of the best.
"I'm a diehard for football," said Hunter. "I love to compete."
While he loves to compete, Hunter didn't take part in the defensive back workouts at the Combine, instead opting to do so at his pro day at Colorado.
He also won't take part in the workouts with the receivers on Saturday, as he is listed with both position groups as he said he wants to play both positions in the NFL.
Hunter, who is Jeremiah's No. 2 overall prospect in his Top 50, was the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year in 2024 and averaged an incredible 111.5 snaps per game from 2023-24, which led the FBS and is a reason he said he can play on both sides of the ball in the NFL.
"I've been doing this for a long time, so I feel like I can keep doing it," said Hunter. "Hopefully they'll let me go out there 100 percent (at both positions), but that's up to the organization."
Per Stacey Dales on the NFL Network broadcast of the Combine, Hunter didn't know that he would be invited to the Combine at both positions and wasn't sure how the invite for both came about, but he welcomed it.

Advice from Freiermuth: Penn State's Tyler Warren is considered by many to be the top tight end in the 2025 NFL Draft class, and he is hoping he does everything he can to prove it during the Combine.
"It's exciting to have the opportunity to come here to the Combine and have an opportunity to meet with the teams and all that," said Warren. "But being back here is nice. It's a great stadium and I've enjoyed being here. So it's awesome."
Warren finished his Penn State career first among tight ends in total touchdowns (25 total; 19 receiving, 6 rushing), receptions (153), receiving yards (1,839), receiving touchdowns (19) and 100-yard games (5).
He is hoping to show his versatility to the teams, letting them know he can do whatever is asked of him.
"What I try and do is be a guy that can kind of fit in a lot of different roles," said Warren. "I don't know if I have one that really sticks out the best. That's kind of the fun about the tight end position is you get to do a lot of different things within the offense."
Warren, who won the John Mackey Award presented to the nation's top tight end in 2024, has gotten some advice from other Penn State tight ends, including the Steelers Pat Freiermuth who he said he patterns his game after, about how to approach everything.
"I actually talked to Theo (Johnson) and Brenton (Strange) talked to me, Pat (Freiermuth) talked to me," said Warren. "They're there and if I have questions, I can ask them. They're not blowing me up. They know it's a busy time. But they've been a big help. If there's ever any questions, I can call them, text them and they're going to help me out."
While Warren is getting praise for being the top tight end in the group, he said he isn't focused on anybody but himself.
"I'm not really focused on trying to be better than other people," said Warren. "Just trying to be the best tight end I can be and I think that's what's helped me do whatever is needed within the offense. That's what I focus on. I try to get good at a lot of different things in a lot of different roles."
And those roles include catching and blocking, things he knows are equally important when he takes his game to the NFL.
"Obviously, being a tight end if you want to be a really good one, you're going to have to do both," said Warren. "You can't just go out and catch passes and you can't just be a run blocker at that spot.
"That's the point I've been trying to get across when I've met with teams."
Showing up for Pittsburgh: Among the tight ends taking part in the Combine drills tonight is Pitt's Gavin Bartholomew.
Bartholomew is one of four Pitt players participating in the combine, and he is enjoying being in Indianapolis with his college teammates.
"It's awesome," said Bartholomew. "We were all sitting in a room together and talking. We were talking about where we were when we first got to college and how we got where we are now. We were putting that into perspective and realizing we've got a long road ahead of us.
"I'm just so happy for those guys and grateful I was able to play with them."
Since the end of the Pitt season, Bartholomew has been doing his best to prepare for the combine and take his game to the next level, and that includes all aspects.
"My toughness and grittiness, my willingness to work," said Bartholomew. "I'm never going to give up on something. I take pride in that. When I get the ball in my hands, I'm a playmaker. Rarely am I ever going to be tackled by one guy. That's the mindset that I have. It's pretty much going to take the whole team to bring me down."
Bartholomew is hoping the Combine gives him an opportunity to show NFL scouts what he is capable of and lands him with a team where he can make an impact.
"It's my competitiveness and my toughness that stands out to them," said Bartholomew. "They know I can dominate in the run game, and I can work my (butt) off. I'm just trying to prove myself in the pass game. Hopefully I do that.
"I'm trying to better my game everywhere. Really in the pass, at the top of the route to create separation. I've really worked on my top-end speed to get that separation and break away from defenders. Then, technique stuff in the run game.
"I like to compete. It's what I do. At the end of the day, I try my best to set up my future wherever I go."

Baking with Beanie
Steelers.com
If you have checked out Beanie Bishop's Instagram story as of late, there is something you might have noticed.
He has expanded on a hobby that originally piqued his interest when he was in college, and has since grown to something that brings relaxation and an escape from the grind of the NFL.
Baking.
Bishop picked up baking when he was attending Western Kentucky, baking cakes for himself and others to enjoy.
But being a college student, there wasn't always time to get into it as much as he would have liked.
"I got away from it," admitted Bishop. "Just really didn't have the time for it."
Until now, that is.
With more time on his hands, Bishop went back to baking this season, even posting an image of a Kitchen Aid Professional 600 Mixer he purchased to help with 'Bakin with Beans.'
"It's just trying to find ways to get away from football," said Bishop. "I wanted to find something else to do. I got into baking and cooking and things like that."
Bishop has been doing his homework too. In addition to doing research before he purchased the mixer, he also researches recipes and isn't afraid to find ways to do things better.
"I find stuff online, for sure," said Bishop. "I might come across some I saved from a while back, from a long time ago. And I'm like, 'Man, I've got to try this one day.' I've been having the time and the resources to be able to do that now."
Baking is a stress reliever for Bishop, but there is also that little bit of stress he feels as he is always striving for perfection, especially when he brings some of his baked goods to the locker room for his teammates to be taste testers.
"It's a lot of fun for me, it's an escape," said Bishop. "But it can be stressful too. It's a different stress. I feel like you stress in every situation, whether it is good or bad stress.
"This is different. I don't have to think about different things or somebody trying to attack me in a different way, as far as football terms and stuff like that. But it's just making sure of the consistency of the recipe and what I make and that everything is just right for it to come out good. You've got to make sure that you follow the steps because if you don't follow them, something's going to be wrong."
So far, Bishop seems to have it all down pat, and the reviews have been good.
"I usually bring the treats to the practice facility if I've got a lot leftover and stuff like that," said Bishop. "People have said it's good, so that's a good sign."

Rookie Recap: Roman Wilson
Steelers.com
When the Steelers selected receiver Roman Wilson in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft, with the 84th overall pick, there were high hopes for what he could bring to the offense in his rookie season.
But injuries derailed his rookie season, not just once, but twice.
Wilson suffered an ankle injury in the first padded practice of Steelers training camp, missing the remainder of camp and the preseason. He returned to the field for the Oct. 13 Week 6 game against the Las Vegas Raiders, playing just five snaps.
Wilson was placed on the Reserve/Injured List with a hamstring injury on Oct. 28, and while he was designated for return prior to the final regular season game, he remained on the list for the rest of the season.
Wilson did say returning to practice benefited him, something that can carry over into the offseason.
"My body feels better than it's felt in a long time," said Wilson after returning to practice. "Mentally, I can't really find a word for it. Just focused. Determined. I got a lot of expectations for myself, and I've got a lot of things I've got to do to be able to reach those goals.
"It was good getting back out there and getting my feet back and building every single day."
That has been Wilson's focus since the season began, improving every day. Whether it was on the field, in the classroom, film study, weight room, his goal has always been to continue to improve.
And that hasn't changed.
"For me, it's just finding a way to get better every day," said Wilson. "Climbing every single day trying to build on what I have and looking forward to what I can get for myself. Just keep building, keep getting better. Trusting the coaches. Trusting my teammates. Believe in myself and it'll be good."
Wilson, who played college football at Michigan where he appeared in 46 career games, finishing his career with 107 receptions for 1,707 yards and 20 touchdowns, spent his time on the Reserve/Injured List focused on ways he could improve and better himself both on and off the field
"Just building a good routine so when I get back, I can pick up better than where I left off," said Wilson. "Getting here early, trying to get here earlier than what I was doing before. I take care of my body at a higher level. Watching more film, talking to the coaches more, working on my craft more, getting in the weight room, fixing up my body, and a better plan for myself."

Steelers fans turn out to show their support
Steelers.com
Steelers fans across the globe showed their support for the black and gold on Sunday as a part of Steelers 'World Photo Day.'
It was an opportunity for fans to put on their black and gold best and show their support for the Steelers ahead of the team's season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Fans from 20 countries and 89 cities took part, including large groups, small gatherings, friends and families, totaling 4,474 fans.

Giving back on a special day
Steelers.com
Today is a special day in sports.
It's a day to celebrate the women who made an impact, and continue to make an impact, on the field and in board rooms, in sports.
It's National Girls & Women in Sports Day (NGWSD), a day that originated in 1987 when it was declared by then President Ronald Reagan. It was originally designated to honor late Olympic volleyball player Flo Hyman and has since evolved to recognize all girls and women in sports in any fashion.
The Steelers are celebrating the day by the women in the organization doing their part to help out young female athletes.
The Steelers partnered with Operation Warm to package and distribute over 500 sports bras to Pittsburgh Public Schools Girls Flag Football team, as well as other sports programs in the schools, with 250 plus students receiving two bras each as part of the Fly:FWD program. Fly:FWD sports bras serve as a bridge, empowering girls to overcome obstacles and excel in sports with unwavering confidence and are committed to making a difference in the lives of young athletes, setting them on a path of empowerment and wellness.
"We are excited to serve and provide equipment to the girls in the Pittsburgh community in order to ensure that they have the right equipment they need in order to stay active, not only in girls flag football, or any women's sports in general, but even in a gym class," said Lindsay Grassia, Director of Partnerships for Operation Warm. "They need a sports bra in order to be comfortable, in order to increase their confidence and be able to participate.
"We know there are a lot of challenges girls are facing in youth sports. Girls are twice as likely as boys to drop out of sports in their middle school ages. If you layer on socioeconomic status, sometimes that number jumps up to about six times more likely than boys are to drop out of sports. There's a variety of issues and we can't solve all of them. But if we can provide and remove one barrier in terms of access to equipment and to ensure that they have the right equipment to stay active, that's really our mission moving forward."
The event was held on NGWSD to bring together women in sports to reach out and help young girls who are just getting their footing in sports.

"It's a really exciting opportunity," said Blayre Holmes-Davis, the Steelers Director of Community Relations. "For the past couple of years, we've been trying as a team to think of things that we can really throw our efforts behind. We've been able to visit some different schools and highlight young students who wrote books about being a female athlete and what that means playing in a male dominated sport and celebrate them. But this event is really an opportunity for all of us as a team and staff to come together and really specifically for the amazing women who work here in the organization to be able to recognize and celebrate that day. But then also how do we make sure that the young women in our community who play sports have all the resources that they need in order to excel and compete?
"One of the biggest things that we found out was a barrier to young women participating in sports is having access to equipment that includes sports bras. I'm really thankful to be able to partner with Operation Warm to work with them to provide sports bras.
"It's an amazing opportunity to not only be with all of our female colleagues to recognize that day, but also to just have an event to really get our hands and create something that's really going to be able to help further female athletes and specifically in girls flag football. We're really excited about it."
Members of the Steelers staff, along with representatives from the Pirates, Penguins, Riverhounds and Riveters, gathered at Acrisure Stadium for the distribution for flag football teams from Allderdice, Brashear, Carrick, Obama and Westinghouse high schools.
"It's really great to all work together," said Holmes-Davis. "We partner on a lot of different events together from back-to-school events, food distributions, and a lot of other celebrations that are happening in the city that are very similar. All of the sports teams have a way of recognizing the day, but specifically to take time out to work together for a volunteer opportunity and to have all the sports team represented, it's a really exciting day.
"I think it continues to show the City of Pittsburgh that not only do all the teams individually work to help uplift our community, but collectively we all truly believe in making sure that Pittsburgh and the students here have everything that they need."
Students from Pittsburgh Public Schools were on hand to receive the sports bras, and also to help package them for their fellow students.
"I think this is amazing," said Karen Arnold, the Director of Interscholastic Athletics for Pittsburgh Public Schools. "This was something that was brought to the forefront for me a couple of years ago in track. It has expanded into other sports to make sure that all of our girls have what they need to feel comfortable when they go out to play their sport and know the girls are taken care of and they are protected.
"And to have all the sports teams a part of this, especially since it's male driven sports except for the Riveters, it's amazing they're recognizing that our girls need the support, too. To come together as one full group to support our kids, especially in Pittsburgh Public School, is awesome."
The Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles collaborated to grow girls flag football in Pennsylvania and were instrumental in the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) voting to sanction it as a high school sport beginning with the 2025-26 school year.
The PIAA required there be 100 teams playing the sport at the high school level in the state in order for the sport to be sanctioned, and thanks to the efforts of both professional football teams, as of the Spring of 2024 there were 101 teams playing girls flag football in Pennsylvania. The Steelers and Eagles collaborated over the past three girls flag football seasons to grow the sport through clinics, camps, hosting games, education, equipment distribution and more.
"As we have seen women's sports take off, especially with our Girls Flag Football program, we want to make sure we are supporting the programs that only we have there, but the other teams have too," said Holmes-Davis. "We want to make sure the young women feel confident when they're playing. We realize this is just something small, but it can go a long way in making sure that they feel comfortable and then also that they're able to excel in the sport that they're in."
The Steelers efforts started small with girls flag football with only six teams taking part the first season. Now, the number of teams sits at 36 in the Pittsburgh region and 100 plus in the state. Through sponsorship help from Nike with uniforms, to donations from the teams of equipment and more, the sport was able to grow by leaps and bounds.
The team has hosted a yearly Girls Flag Football Jamboree, Girls Flag Football Leagues, Girls Flag Football Championships and a uniform unveiling at Acrisure Stadium. And through the support of current and former Steelers players, the attention to the game has soared.
"We just want to show support to the girls, even providing a motivation card as well," said Holmes-Davis. "It's something to let them know keep going, we're proud of you. It also lets them know we recognize and see who they are, not only as individuals, but also as female athletes and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support them."

Labriola on the loss to the Bengals
Steelers.com
This would've been nobody's idea of how to go into the playoffs.
On a four-game losing streak. With an offense that scored a combined 6 touchdowns in those games and never was able to crack the 20-point mark. With a defense that gradually has become less dynamic in the play-making department. With seemingly little going for it except the best placekicker in the league.
There should be no argument that this is not the way the Steelers wanted to be entering the playoffs, but it has become their reality. Super Wild Card Weekend will begin with 2 games on Saturday, Jan. 11 (4:30 p.m., 8 p.m.), 3 games on Sunday, Jan. 12 (1 p.m., 4:30 p.m., 8:15 p.m.), and 1 on Monday, Jan. 13 (8:15 p.m.), and the Steelers clinched their spot in this single-elimination tournament on the same weekend their losing streak started.
After losing to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Kansas City during an 11-day span, the Steelers had a mini-bye before the regular season finale against the Bengals at Acrisure Stadium. It looked to be a nice opportunity for a get-right against a team in a do-or-die situation with respect to its own playoff hopes, a team with a top-quality offense and a less-than-intimidating defense. In other words, a winnable game for them, if for no other reason than they had defeated the Bengals, 44-38, on Dec. 1 in Cincinnati.
But this rematch was nothing like that one. After scoring 44 points and posting 520 total net yards and 28 first downs, after showcasing a passing attack that distributed the ball to 10 different receivers as part of an offense that had only one of its first 10 possessions end with a punt before going into victory formation, the Steelers offense was stymied Saturday night through three quarters to the tune of 7 first downs and 91 total net yards. Instead of getting open and making catches for chunks of yardage, the receivers were more a liability than an asset. And nobody was blameless.
George Pickens' final stat line showed him being targeted 6 times but only able to finish one of those and that 1 catch was good for zero yards. Calvin Austin III had zero catches but had the ball hit his hands beyond the line to gain on a third down before one of Corliss Waitman's 5 punts. Even Pat Freiermuth, who had 8 catches for 85 yards and a 19-yard touchdown, had an on-target throw go through his hands on a fourth down beyond the line to gain in the final seconds that would have given Chris Boswell a chance at another game-winning field goal.
The defense was better than it had been during this four-game slide, but it wasn't dynamic enough to be the difference in the outcome.
In Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins, the Bengals present the best "quarterback-starting-wide-receiver" group in the NFL, and the Steelers defense allowed them 1 touchdown in 4 trips into the red zone, including 0-for-2 in goal-to-go situations. There was a good bit of bending along the way, though, and because the defense had only one takeaway – on a Beanie Bishop scoop of a pass first tipped by Patrick Queen – the Bengals' 38 minutes in time of possession controlled the ball and the clock and the flow of the game.
What was a stark difference came in the play of the respective quarterbacks. Burrow completed 77.1 percent, and when it became clear the Steelers were keeping a lid on Chase and Higgins – neither of whom had a catch for 20-plus yards – he was patient and disciplined and got the ball to 5 different tight ends for 114 yards that kept the ball in the Bengals' hands for 71 offensive snaps.
Wilson's numbers pale in comparison. He completed 54.8 percent, the Steelers ran 13 fewer plays, and the offense didn't go over 100 total net yards until the game was into the fourth quarter. But the drops – or not-completed-catches if you prefer the kinder, gentler spin – were an undeniable factor. And if that ball doesn't go through Freiermuth's hands on the fourth-down pass, if Boswell drills the kick, and if the Steelers win, 20-19, Wilson could be seen as a savvy, experienced NFL starter capable of engineering victory in January.
As for the rest of it, the defense has something to build on after allowing just 1 touchdown and 3 red zone field goals while going toe-to-toe with an offense that came in leading the NFL in passing yards per game and was No. 6 in points per game. Special teams contributed when it recovered a muffed punt in the fourth quarter that set up a Boswell field goal. And pending the outcome of Sunday's Chargers at Raiders game, neither of the possibilities on Wild Card Weekend – at Houston or at Baltimore – presents an unwinnable game.
It's not going to be spun that way now, though, because the Steelers lost to the Bengals, 19-17, and the act of ending their regular season with an 0-fer does nothing to instill confidence heading into the postseason. Ready or not, they are heading into the postseason anyway, and during the weekend of Jan. 11-13 they will be playing the Texans in Houston or the Ravens in Baltimore during Super Wild Card Weekend.
It's going to happen, and the way they have to view it is as an opportunity. They have done enough to qualify, and so by definition they belong. Nothing matters except how they prepare and then perform in the stadium. They – coaches and players alike – have been at this since late May, and this chance is what they spent every one of those days working toward. Starting Monday, everybody still playing is 0-0.
"I'm confident. I'm sorry I don't have the energy behind this, but I'm very confident in the group," said Cam Heyward. "You know, as a professional you work your butt off to be ready week in and week out. There is belief in the group, and that's all that matters. Instead of thinking of the multitude of it, I'm taking it game by game. We're in the dance. Nobody is going to make it easy for us, but I like us vs. anybody.
"You can say I'm blowing smoke, but I do. And I like the group. It's about ironing out our mistakes and cleaning it up yesterday."
Because there will be no tomorrow if they don't.

Rookie Recap: Ryan Watts
Steelers.com
It was a tough 2024 for several Steelers rookies, missing all or the majority of the year due to injuries.
Defensive back Ryan Watts was one of those rookies.
Watts, the second of the Steelers two sixth-round draft picks in the 2024 NFL Draft, suffered a season-ending injury in the preseason finale against the Detroit Lions, missing the entire 2024 season.
Watts, who was the 195th overall pick, spent two seasons at Texas, after transferring from Ohio State. While with the Longhorns he played in 24 games, starting 23, recording 89 tackles, 63 of them solo stops. He also had five tackles for a loss, seven passes defensed, one interception and one sack.
"Just his body of work," said Coach Mike Tomlin about what he liked about Watts when he was drafted. "He's a long guy. He runs well. He's got position flexibility. He plays with an edge. So those are some of the real tangible reasons why."
In 2023 he recorded 38 tackles, 30 of them solo stops, in 11 games. He added three passes defensed and a tackle for a loss.
In 2022 he was an honorable mention All-Big 12 selection by the league's coaches and earned honorable mention All-Big 12 Defensive Newcomer Player of the Year honor. He was also named to the Academic All-Big 12 First Team in 2022 and was a member of the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll (spring 2022).
"I could fit anywhere, really," said Watts of his position flexibility. "I feel with my size and my speed and moving my body. I feel like not a lot of 6-3 corners can move like I can. So, to be able to just keep developing. I feel like I can be played at safety, nickel, corner. I feel like I can just maximize my potential anywhere."
He played two seasons at Ohio State, appearing in 19 games. He helped Ohio State win a Big Ten Championship, a Sugar Bowl Championship and an appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game in 2020.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 25
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
RANDY HOFFERT FROM NEW HOLLAND, PA: The Steelers should have drafted Tyler Guyton instead of Troy Fautanu. Guyton is a better player and not made of plastic. Fautanu couldn't stay healthy in college and he won't stay healthy in the pros. ANSWER: Troy Fautanu (6-4, 317) was selected 20th overall in the 2024 NFL Draft by the Steelers, and Tyler Guyton (6-7, 322) was selected 29th overall by Dallas in the same draft. While Fautanu did injure a knee and missed all but 55 snaps of his rookie season, Guyton appeared in 15 games, with 11 starts as a rookie. In his 670 offensive snaps, Guyton was flagged for 5 holding penalties, 5 false start penalties, and he committed two other penalties that either were declined or were part of an offsetting foul situation. Your assertion that Fautanu "couldn't stay healthy in college" is not supported by facts. Fautanu played 41 games in his four seasons at the University of Washington, including 28 games in his final two college seasons (2022-23). I don't know whether it'll be Fautanu or Guyton who ends up with a longer/better professional career, and I suspect that you don't know either.
MASON CHRISTOPHER FROM WINAMAC, IN: Will Justin Fields be returning to the Steelers? ANSWER: I think we should have the answer to that question when free agency begins on Wednesday, March 12.
JAROD ALLISON FROM ROCKWOOD, PA: I took a look at some of the names of former Steelers who may be available via free agency. Names include Artie Burns, Kelvin Beachum, Javon Hargrave, Robert Spillane, Juju Smith-Schuster, Mason Rudolph, Kendrick Green, Devin Bush, Mike Hilton, Diontae Johnson, Chukwuma Okorafor. Anyone in there you'd have an interest in signing to strengthen a position? ANSWER: Me? No.
TIMOTHY PAULL FROM PAHRUMP, NV: With the years of poor offensive production, do you attribute this to just not having the playmaking talent at the skill positions, or is it not getting creative offensive coordinators, or is it schematics that are antiquated, or some combination? ANSWER: Talent is what wins in the NFL. People become too enamored with the concept of schemes and game plans and play-calls, but Super Bowl LIX definitively showed that none of that matters if the other guys are better. The Chiefs offensive line was handled on a consistent basis, and the Eagles managed that without blitzing. When that is happening, you can have a great quarterback (Patrick Mahomes) and a superior strategist (Andy Reid), and that's not going to be enough. The Steelers have used the previous couple of offseasons to invest in their offensive line, and now it's necessary to address the issue that's been identified as an offseason priority. Quarterback. I believe what you're referring to as "years of poor offensive production" coincide with the seasons following Ben Roethlisberger's retirement. And the goal isn't to find the next Ben Roethlisberger – because that might never happen – but to find a way to get more consistently effective play at the quarterback position.
LUKAS CARDINAL FROM SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA: When do you think the Steelers will make a decision at quarterback for the 2025 season? I understand they want to do their due diligence on exploring every option, but we've seen them make other moves. Just curious if you could provide some insight. ANSWER: I have written this before, and not just once, that I believe the aim is to have identified and then signed the better of the Russell Wilson-Justin Fields option by the start of free agency on Wednesday, March 12. Doing that would open up the rest of the offseason for the Steelers to explore ways to deal with other areas of the depth chart they identify as being in need of reinforcement or an injection of top-level talent.
DAN COLOMBIN FROM OKMULGEE, OK: Did Steelers hire Hines Ward as coach? ANSWER: No. Hines Ward is the receivers coach at Arizona State.
MIKE WINN FROM SARATOGA SPRINGS, NY: I know there are a lot of questions about the Steelers quarterback situation for next year. I saw New England's No. 3 quarterback – Joe Milton III – play in the season finale vs. Buffalo. Granted it was a meaningless game for the Bills, but Milton, who is 6-foot-5, looked good. He threw some accurate passes and made some good decisions. He would be a project and a gamble, but he would also be relatively cheap to acquire, no? ANSWER: No. Joe Milton III played 6 college seasons – 3 for Michigan and then 3 for Tennessee – and he appeared in 43 games for the Wolverines and Volunteers, where he completed 400-of-649 (61.3 percent) for 5,353 yards, with 37 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also rushed 174 times for 661 yards (3.8 average) and 12 more touchdowns. All of that sounds good, but Milton entered the NFL as a sixth-round pick of New England (193rd overall) in 2024, which means the Patriots have total control over his rights for the next 3 seasons. In the unlikely event the Patriots would cut him, Milton would be subject to waivers, and the Steelers would be 21st in priority to claim him. And because Milton is on the books for the veteran minimum salary for the next 3 years, the notion that the Patriots would want to trade him based on the miniscule value he would bring back to them isn't realistic in the least.
NICHOLAS MOSES FROM SIMI VALLEY, CA: Javon Hargrave seems like a logical choice for the Steelers to pursue this offseason given their poor run defense. What are your thoughts on that? Also, please tell me the Steelers would not seriously consider signing a 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers. ANSWER: My thoughts on both of the options you present is that it makes as much sense to sign a 32-year-old NT who played in only 3 games in 2024 after a season-ending torn triceps in Week 3 to help the run defense as it would to think signing a 41-year-old would be the answer at quarterback.
LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM, PA: I thought Corliss Waitman was effective enough as an injury replacement for Cameron Johnston as the Steelers punter. But was he effective enough for the Steelers to give him an opportunity in 2025? I assume Waitman will be a free agent come March 12. Am I correct? ANSWER: Corliss Waitman is under contract to the Steelers for the 2025 season for a reported salary of $1.1 million.

Bleier is Steelers Salute to Service nominee
Steelers.com
To Steelers fans, he is known simply as Rocky Bleier, or even 'Rock' for short.
To those in the United States military, he is known differently.
Specialist 4 Robert Patrick Bleier, Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient.
So, it should come as no surprise that Bleier is the Steelers nominee for the NFL's Salute to Service Award presented by USAA.
The award recognizes NFL players, coaches, personnel and legends who make a commitment to supporting the military community.
And nobody has made, or continues to make, a commitment like Bleier.
Bleier, who played college football at Notre Dame, was drafted by the Steelers in the 16th round of the 1968 NFL Draft.
Bleier played 11 seasons for the Steelers, was a member of the four Super Bowl teams in the 1970s and is now a member of the Steelers Hall of Honor. He rushed for 3,865 yards and 23 touchdowns, while catching 136 passes for 1,294 yards and two touchdowns in an offense that featured Hall of Famers Franco Harris, Lynn Swann and John Stallworth.
His life, though, is defined by much more than statistics.
A year after he was drafted by the Steelers, he was drafted into the United States Army and left football to go fight in the Vietnam War. It would change his life.
While on a mission to help others, he suffered an injury he thought would end his football career before it barely got started. He was wounded when enemy gunfire hit him in the thigh and shrapnel from a grenade hit him in his lower legs, causing him to lose part of his right foot, while on a mission with the Charlie Company 4th Battalion (Light), 31st Infantry, 196th Light Infantry Brigade while on an attempt to recover the bodies of others killed in an ambush in Hiep Duc. During the recovery attempt four additional soldiers were killed and 25 others were wounded, including Bleier.
Bleier left with his life, but assumed his football career was over.
That wasn't the case.
Bleier received the support of Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr. throughout his time in Vietnam, and upon his return with a Bronze Star and Purple Heart, Rooney allowed him the opportunity to work his way back onto the field, which he eventually did for the 1971 season.
Bleier could have easily given up football, but instead fought back and served as an inspiration to all.
"When I came here, especially trying to make a professional football team, I didn't know what the future would hold," said Bleier. "I know the biggest part of my life has been in Pittsburgh, with an organization and a family like the Rooney family and how they ran the organization. Whatever success I have is tied directly to an opportunity, being given a chance, being a teammate with all of those Hall of Famers, being on a team that won those four Super Bowls and dominated the imagination of Steelers fans and football fans around the world. I understand that. It's not that I individually had great talents. I was surrounded by a group that had great standards.
"When I look back at success and whatever has happened in my life, it is part of being a group of people that helped raise your stature in the world of sports and in this city."
Bleier returned to Vietnam in 2018 for the first time since he was injured for an ESPN documentary, 'The Return.' He went there on the 49th Anniversary of the day he was wounded, for an emotional, raw, and painful visit to the rice field where the attack took place.
Bleier has shared his story, time and again in different manners, but this time he was hoping the way it was shared didn't just help him, but other veterans who also served in Vietnam.
"In hindsight, I look back and I am very happy to have gone back," said Bleier. "I think it gave me the closure I wasn't aware that was needed. It gives me a great deal of satisfaction that if in the end it gives somebody else the closure they need, maybe helps them understand and close things. That would make it all worthwhile."
Because the bottom line is, there is nothing Bleier wants more than to help others.
Bleier wrote a book about the battle to come back from his injury called 'Fighting Back: The Rocky Bleier Story,' which was made into a television movie in 1980. He released a special edition of the book to help the Fighting Back for Veterans campaign. The new release, titled 'Fighting Back: The Inspirational Journey of American Hero Rocky Bleier,' benefitted military veterans' groups, including Veterans Leadership, Joint Training Facility, and Legacies Alive.
"The idea was to be a voice for the veterans today," said Bleier when it was released. "There are new pictures, so it's up-to-date so other generations can enjoy. It's a story. It's one of those timeless stories of overcoming obstacles and perseverance generations need to read."
Bleier, who has remained in Pittsburgh since his playing career ended, has been a staple in the community since his retirement, especially aiding in veteran causes. He speaks to businesses, athletes and fellow veterans about his experiences to help them in their lives.
He currently supports numerous veteran causes, including Operation Strong Vet, Victory Media, and Nationally Owned Veterans Business Association (NaVOBA). He has been involved with the Wounded Warriors Project, Warriors2Citizens, Veterans Job Fair, Operation Check Point, Homeless Vet Run, Vietnam Veterans of America, The Crucible, National Veterans Wheelchair Games, SW Veterans Center, and Veterans Leadership Program.
Bleier is also actively involved with St. Barnabas Health, and has worked with Habitat for Humanity, Boy Scouts of America, Special Olympics and the United Way.
Bleier is also one of the owners and managing members of RBVetCo, a service-disabled, veteran owned company. RBVetCo specializes in the construction of commercial buildings, renovations and additions.
Bleier starred in, "The Play: With Rocky Bleier," a 90-minute, one-man play that shared his life from wounded warrior, to Super Bowl champion, to family man and community activist.
"He has had an interesting life. An exceptional life," said former teammate and Hall of Famer Lynn Swann when 'The Play' was performed. "Rocky is a hero. He saved lives in Vietnam. He overcame great obstacles just to be able to walk, let alone play football."
Bleier was honored with the NCAA Inspiration Award in 2020, which is presented to a coach or administrator who is actively associated with intercollegiate athletics, or to a current or former varsity letter-winner at an NCAA institution who used perseverance, dedication and determination to overcome a life-altering situation and serve as a role model to give inspiration to others in similar situations. For a member of the armed forces confronted with a duty-connected situation to be eligible for the Inspiration Award, the action must be clearly above and beyond the call of duty and so recognized by the appropriate military command.
And no doubt, Bleier checked all those boxes, and continues to check boxes and inspire others.
"The older I get the more I appreciate Rocky and his story and his triumphs," said Hall of Famer and former teammate Mel Blount. "He showed us all about perseverance, commitment and hard work. That determination to accomplish the goals he set.
"He is a guy who showed us how to live and taught us about life's challenges and how to overcome them."
Fans have an opportunity to vote and help determine the award's three finalists. To cast your vote for Rocky, visit NFL.com/SaluteFanVote . From now until November 30, fans can submit one vote per day. Finalists of the award will be announced in January, and the recipient will be recognized at NFL Honors, a primetime awards special to air nationally in February during the week of Super Bowl LIX.
As the presenting sponsor of the Salute to Service Award, USAA, will contribute $25,000 in the recipient's name to official aid societies representing all U.S. military branches. The NFL will match USAA's contribution by donating an additional $25,000 to the awardee's military or veteran charity of choice.
The Salute to Service Award is part of the NFL and USAA's year-round commitment to recognize and honor the military and veteran community. Through the Salute to Service initiative, the NFL and its 32 teams come together to honor, empower and connect with service members, veterans and their families. Salute to Service will come to life in NFL stadiums across the country during Weeks 10-12 of the regular season through on-field branding and other game day activations.

Ogunjobi is Steelers Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year nominee
Steelers.com
For Larry Ogunjobi, being 'the first' is something that just seems to be a part of his life.
Ogunjobi was a member of the University of Charlotte's first-ever recruiting class and played for the 49ers in their inaugural season.
He was the first from the school to play in the Reese's Senior Bowl, he made the first tackle for a loss in school history and was also the first one from the school to be named to a national award watchlist when he was named to the Chuck Bednarik Award and Outland Trophy watchlists.
Ogunjobi was even asked by his college coach, Brad Lambert, to be the first in school history to wear 'No. 49,' representing the school's nickname of the '49ers.'
It's no surprise, with the impact he made at Charlotte, that he was the first in school history to be invited to the NFL Scouting Combine and the first player from the school to be selected in the NFL Draft.
It's those firsts, plus some that are way more meaningful in his life, that inspired him to create the First of Many Foundation.
And now, he has the potential to add another first to that list.
Ogunjobi could become the first Nigerian born player to win the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.
Ogunjobi is the Steelers nominee for the 2024 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, presented by Nationwide, an honor he more than deserves with the way he truly gives from the heart.
Ogunjobi learned of his nomination during a team meeting this week, when Cameron Heyward, the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year, surprised him with the news.
"I have had the privilege of winning this award," said Heyward as he made the announcement. "It's about what Walter Payton stands for, being a good man on the field, off the field. (Larry) does a lot, doesn't say a lot, but we get the privilege of seeing all of his work."
Ogunjobi was humbled by the honor, but knows it's what he should be doing.
"We've got an obligation to give," said Ogunjobi during the meeting. "God has blessed us in tremendous ways. Our opportunity to give back to people is big. When you have an opportunity to put the light somewhere other than yourself, you have a chance to really make a difference. Let this be an example, anybody can do it, you guys can do it. Keep striving for greatness."
When he left the meeting, he was still feeling the same way, blessed to be considered for the honor, but also knowing it's what anyone in his place should do.
"It's an honor and blessing," said Ogunjobi. "You've seen guys who have worn that mantle at the highest level, like Cam who actually won it last year. You see the work that he's put in and his dedication to serve and to help people. Life is all about helping and giving back. And we have an obligation as professional athletes to do the same.
"I feel blessed to be in this position, and I'm just excited to be able to continue to push this narrative in the right direction."
Ogunjobi is hoping he sets an example for younger players, being someone they can follow in the path of giving back.
"I think it's very important because when you're in a space, and obviously we we're all about football and doing what we've got to do to win and make plays, and that's amazingly important," said Ogunjobi. "But at the same time, giving back and helping others and being a light in this world I think is just as important as well."

Ogunjobi has found numerous ways to give back to the community, a lot of it through his First of Many Foundation.
"I am first-generation Nigerian," said Ogunjobi. "The foundation focuses around first generation kids whose parents are immigrants, coming from different countries to find a better life in the States. We focus on things like mental health, childhood obesity, mentorship, and things of that nature.
"Being the first generation in my family, the first player drafted from my college, I thought it was big to set the bar and continue to lead by example. That is why the foundation was so important to me. I want to help people who have the vision, but not a road map. I want to give them the tools they need to move forward in life."
Ogunjobi's focus with his nomination is the American Heart Association and fighting childhood obesity, something that he dealt with as a kid, and it was his first step on the football field that changed everything for him.
"I was obese when I was growing up," said Ogunjobi. "I didn't start playing football until my sophomore year in high school. I was about 350 pounds. I understand the struggles for kids that are overweight. I know football changed my life. So being able to highlight a cause that changed my life for the better is very important to me."
Ogunjobi was more interested in playing video games than football growing up, but that all changed when he got a push to sign up for the Ragsdale High football team in Jamestown, North Carolina.
Ogunjobi put his mind to getting in shape to make the team, and he did just that.
"I had a coach my sophomore year of high school," said Ogunjobi. "My dad met him at the park, and he wanted to help. I didn't really know anything about football or anything like that, but he just wanted to help me lose weight.
"He trained me for about a month or so and one day we were driving by the high school, and he said you are going to play football. I said, no, I'm not. He said yes, you are. We got into an argument. He took me to the front office, got the permission slip and my mom signed it.
"I was on the football field that Saturday. When I finished the workout, I couldn't finish the sprints. And that was the end of practice. The next day they came up to me and said, Larry, are you still here. I said, yes, I am still here. In my head I was thinking because I have to be.
"I went through my junior varsity season and got the award for most improved JV player. And I went from 350 the summer of my sophomore year to 247 the summer of my junior year. I lost around 100 pounds in a year."
Knowing that it took an awakening for him to develop from the kid who had no interest in playing sports and would rather sit around playing video games, to the professional athlete he is today, has inspired Ogunjobi to do his part to help kids.
He holds an annual football camp at his high school, encouraging kids to get out and be active and give it a shot.
"I understand that it's important to be active and not live a sedentary life, be able to move around," said Ogunjobi. "Get out there and do things you enjoy doing. Find the things you like, the things you don't like, and do the things you like. Expose yourself to things.
"I was a kid that just liked to play video games, I didn't do anything else. Then I was introduced to football, and it became my life. I want to be an outlet and light for kids who might not know where they want to go and show them that it's possible for them too.
"Just give it a chance. Step out of your comfort zone. You might end up liking it more than you thought you would."
Ogunjobi is trying to make a difference in the lives of others in so many ways, from taking kids shopping at the holidays, to providing meals for those in need, to his youth football camp and many other endeavors.
"I am all about community service," said Ogunjobi. "I want to continue moving the needle in the right direction."
Ogunjobi's parents moved to the United States from Nigeria in 1993, a year before he was born. They wanted a better life for themselves, and for their family one day.
Now he wants to help those who are in a similar situation, looking for a better life in the United States.
"As long as you put the work in, believe in yourself, the opportunity is always there. You just have to believe," said Ogunjobi. "When people see examples of people who are like them doing things that are out of the ordinary, they realize I can do this too. We are not that much different after all.
"That is my biggest thing, letting people know you can too. I didn't start this thing as someone who was super touted. It was hard work and dedication that got me to where I am. Being around the right people, surrounding myself with the right people, is super important to me."
Ogunjobi knows getting to where he is today wasn't something that came easy, with his parents and himself facing challenges along the way.
But he knows how lucky he is to be where he is now, and his hope is to help others find similar success in whatever path they choose in life.
"It's gratifying, it's humbling, it's a blessing," said Ogunjobi. "It's something you can never take for granted. My parents came here with nothing. They built a life here, moved here to get a better life. This is the outcome, so I want to make sure I am able to give it back because my parents instilled such a good example in me of that."
While he knows he can't touch every life he would like through his foundation, he is hoping through the words of inspiration he has shared on social media he can touch a much wider audience.
"You never know what someone is going through," said Ogunjobi. "You never know who needs the message. Being able to give back and be that voice for people. That reminder that maybe things aren't going how you want them to, still push yourself in the right direction.
"It's important to understand that regardless of the situation, I can get up."
Ogunjobi, who last year was the Steelers nominee for the Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award, has a passion not just for giving back, but for the game he plays.
"I enjoy the sport," said Ogunjobi. "I should say, I love the sport. I love everything about it. Football has opened so many doors for me, allowed me to do so many things, and help so many people. I owe this game a lot, so I don't take it for granted."
Moreso, though, he doesn't take his responsibility for giving back for granted. He understands the importance of it, and he does it in a wide range of ways.
With football being something he loves so much, he normally kicks off his season of giving back with an event focused on the game.
In June, Ogunjobi held his 4th Annual Youth Football Camp at his alma mater, Ragsdale High School in North Carolina. The event is free to boys and girls in the community to help young athletes learn the fundamentals of football, with the emphasis on teamwork and sportsmanship.
"I think it's super important to give back," said Ogunjobi. "When you come from a place like this, Ragsdale, that is built on family, faith and football, it just feels right to be around people and give back. Ragsdale has done so much for me. Being able to give back, doing the camp, being around the kids is important and I just love it."
Ogunjobi hosted a group of young men from the Urban League of Pittsburgh at a practice during training camp, allowing them to enjoy the action from the sidelines and get an up close and personal look of the team's preparation.
Following practice, Ogunjobi hosted an etiquette dinner for the young men, giving them an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of fine dining while listening to their stories and sharing insight with them to help better prepare them for life.
"We're really proud of the way Larry has given back and embraced the Pittsburgh community," said Coach Mike Tomlin. "But if you look at it, it's something he's been doing throughout his career whether it's through his youth football camps in North Carolina or his holiday toy drive that started in Cleveland. The veteran leadership and character he brings to this team are big reasons we wanted to do business with him in the first place, and we're happy to have him here and proud of the work he's done."
And being prepared for life is something he always stresses with the young people he comes in contact with, and a lot of that is based on education and his upbringing. STEM programs are something that are personal to him, something that he studied in college at the University of Charlotte.
So, for him to be able to host a NIKE STEM x Shoe event this season and share the importance of programs that are enhanced by advanced technology was extremely meaningful. Ogunjobi partnered with Nike, the Boys and Girls Club of Western PA and the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh's Black Male and Female Leadership Development Programs for the event.
"I just think the trajectory of the world and how technology is moving in such a big way, it's good to get the kids involved," said Ogunjobi. "I think everything we have, everything we do is technologically based. I feel like when you start them early it gives them a chance to work through things.
"It caters to the importance of it all. We live in a world where everything that we touch and everything we do is technology. Maximizing that and exposing children early is really cool."
Ogunjobi had a double major in computer science and biology while at Charlotte, something that continues to help him with continuing advancement in technology.
"It gives me a different level of dialogue when I speak to people and it's a different kind of conversation starter," said Ogunjobi. "All the stuff that is going on with AI, all the different advancements, it helps you get a leg up on things."
Ogunjobi continued the spirit of helping kids with education being the focus when he hosted his third annual Back To School event in September. Ogunjobi provided backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh. Ogunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their STEM program.
"I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year," said Ogunjobi. "Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students."
The reaction he received from the kids is always one of joy, happiness and excitement, and having the opportunity to interact with the kids and bring that reaction truly warms his heart.
"It's always good to give back," said Ogunjobi. "I think it's good to be a part of young kids' lives and allow them to see some of the people they look up to give back. I think it's important to leave a mark on the community, show the kids it's important to pay it forward.
"Education is really important and to be able to give back is a blessing.
"I think representation is very important and presence is even more important. Being able to see the person, shake their hand, see them, be in their presence. It puts a name to a face.
"I feel like in basketball and other sports where they don't have a helmet on, they can see that person and know who they are. When you can take the helmet off and show a human side of us, being there for them is really important for the kids."
When asked to help with team endeavors, Ogunjobi is one who is always willing to do his part, including this year when he served as a co-captain for Steelers Style, the team's annual fashion show. The event benefits the UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program, Cancer Bridges and the Chuck Noll Foundation.
"Doing it for the charities, that is the biggest thing," said Ogunjobi. "It's important to give back. It's amazing what we do here, the tradition. It's an honor to be selected as one of the co-captains."
Ogunjobi also enjoyed the opportunity to show off his fashion sense, something he said can show respect, during an event where team bonding thrives.
"It's cool. I enjoy fashion," said Ogunjobi. "It's one of those things where it's look good, feel good, play good. I always try and look presentable, because that's how my parents raised me.
"When I first got in the league, I had guys like Christian Kirksey and Chris Smith take me under their wing when it comes to those kinds of things. I just thought it was cool.
"Wearing certain things, doing certain things, especially being a big man I think it just kind of opens a lot of doors and it's cool."
The holiday season is a special time for Ogunjobi to give back, starting with Thanksgiving when he hosted his third annual Thanksgiving dinner for families served by the YWCA, spending an evening with them where he served the dinner and visited with the individuals.
He also took it one step further, as Ogunjobi also passed out gift cards to each of the families to help with their own Thanksgiving dinner for their family.
"It's really important to help with stuff like this," said Ogunjobi. "The holidays are always hard for people, given certain family situations and things of that nature. Being able to give back is special. My parents took Thanksgiving, Christmas, all of those holidays very seriously. Being able to give back in a big way is important to me.
"Helping people a little less fortunate than I am is one of the best ways to use the blessings God has bestowed upon me. I am always happy, always eager to give back in a big way.
"I understand that it's not by accident each and every one of us are here. It took a lot of hard work, dedication, and a lot of blessings. Because of that, sometimes you do a disservice to yourself, the people that believed in you, if you don't give back. Using your platform in a big way, a big capacity is important.
"You never know what your influence, your presence can do for people. Just those gestures that may not seem big to us are life changing to others."
And it is his presence at the dinner, visiting with everyone and taking the time to talk, listen to their stories, that goes a long way.
"I have been a giver the majority of my life from watching my parents," said Ogunjobi. "Being there, seeing the smiles, getting the hugs, the joyful faces are important. I am just happy to be able to give back in a big way."
At Christmas, Ogunjobi will once again take kids from the Urban League shopping for gifts for themselves, and the opportunity for them to buy for others they love.
"The importance of giving back in this capacity is something that comes from my parents, who have always been givers," said Ogunjobi. "They gave out of nothing when I was growing up.
"Being able to give back in this capacity is very big for me. You just never know what people are going through, especially at the holidays."
Ogunjobi spends the evening with the kids, enjoying every minute of sharing valuable time together.
"To be able to help and be a light is super important to me," said Ogunjobi. "That's how my parents raised me. I am excited to just be able to do it. I think your impact and presence is important and something you should never take for granted.
"I am excited. I love seeing the kid's smiles and what they pick out. Christmas is always a fun time. I am just excited to help."
In addition, Ogunjobi understands what it's like for families that are immigrants to the United States based on his family history. He knows that families can struggle with receiving the basic necessities to help rebuild their life. This is why he is teaming up with Hello Neighbor, a local organization that works to improve the lives of recently resettled refugee and immigrant families by matching them with dedicated neighbors to guide and support them in their new lives. He provides over 30 families with housing items, food, children's clothing and other resources to help make their transition to the Pittsburgh community easier.
"It's just all about giving back," said Ogunjobi. "It's what we all should do."

2024 Season
December 23, 2024
Holiday magic: The holiday season kicked off in perfect fashion for Frank Mitchell, who was the guest of the Steelers at practice on Monday through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Mitchell spent time visiting with the players, getting autographs and photos, and even chatting about his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas with kicker Chris Boswell.
"I've been watching the Steelers my whole life growing up," said Mitchell. "They're my celebrities. It's crazy to see them in person. "It's incredible. I don't even know how to describe it. It's surreal. I'm still overwhelmed. It's crazy."
Mitchell, an 18-year-old, will also be attending the Christmas Day game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Wednesday.
"I've never been to a Steelers game," said Mitchell, who became a fan through his father, who is from the Pittsburgh area. "I've never been to Pittsburgh. We're checking all the boxes on this trip.
"And a game on Christmas Day, I would say that is perfect."

A welcoming neighbor: Defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi hosted a dinner at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center for families who have resettled into the Pittsburgh area recently. He also provided them with gift cards to help with some of the basic necessities they need to adapt to their new life in Pittsburgh.
Ogunjobi worked hand-in-hand with Hello Neighbor, a local organization that works to improve the lives of recently resettled refugee and immigrant families by matching them with dedicated neighbors to guide and support them in their new lives.
Ogunjobi, the Steelers 2024 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year nominee, understands what it's like for families that are immigrants to the United States based on his family history. Ogunjobi's parents moved to the United States from Nigeria in 1993, a year before he was born, to help provide a better life. He knows that families can struggle with receiving the basic necessities to help rebuild their life.
"It's just all about giving back," said Ogunjobi. "It's what we all should do.
"My parents came here with nothing. They built a life here, moved here to get a better life. I want to make sure I am able to give it back because my parents instilled such a good example in me of that."

Why Not You: Quarterback Russell Wilson and his wife Ciara have made it a passion to give back to kids through their Why Not You Foundation. And on Tuesday, they opened their first Why Not You Center, located inside the Shadyside Boys and Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania, yet another step in fulfilling Wilson's promise to give back to the Pittsburgh community.
"Ciara and I are blessed to give back to the community and make a positive impact in the lives of young people. Opening our first Why Not You Center in partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Pennsylvania is a significant step toward creating lasting change," said Wilson. "Every child deserves the support and resources to approach each day with a "why not you" attitude and have the opportunity to dream big and achieve their goals."
The Why Not You Center is designed to enhance educational and recreational environments for kids, reflecting the Why Not You Foundation mission of addressing poverty through education and health programs. The premise of the center is to encourage a Why Not You mindset among the kids and teens, supporting their growth in academic success, career and life readiness, character, leadership and healthy lifestyles.
Around 75 kids were on hand for the opening, and it will be enjoyed by countless others.
Earlier this year Wilson helped kick off a summer camp for the Boys & Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania (BGCWPA) through the foundation and made a $50,000 donation to the BGCWPA at the time.
Reaching out to the youth: The Steelers held their final 'Meeting at the 50-Yard Line' program on Tuesday, visiting Perry Traditional Academy.
The program is part of the Steelers social justice outreach efforts they have been involved with over the last few years.
The program is done in conjunction with the Neighborhood Resilience Project and local high schools to share and discuss conflict de-escalation, resilience, leadership and how to be a positive influence in and out of the classroom.
The players have breakout discussions with the students on violence they have experienced and how they have overcome it.
Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and offensive tackle Dan Moore Jr. were on hand to talk with the kids and about the issues they are dealing with and to get feedback from them.
December 3, 2024
Taking time to listen: The Steelers continued their 'Meeting at the 50-Yard Line' program on Tuesday, visiting Sto-Rox High School.
Linebacker Alex Highsmith and special teams captain Miles Killebrew were on hand to talk with the kids and more importantly, listen to them.

Taking care of new moms: Elandon Roberts and his wife Tori have three children, so they understand the importance of a healthy start for kids.
To make things better for expectant and new moms, Roberts hosted a Baby Shower for New Moms at Hosanna House in conjunction with Healthy Start.
Healthy Start's mission is to improve Black maternal and child health and to reduce poor birth outcomes and infant mortality in Allegheny County.
"The work that Healthy Start does is important to me because me and my wife did research, and we noticed in Allegheny County, there are more Black women passing away from births or discovering defects at birth. We wanted to make sure that we set our platform that we were able to help and put another hand in a pot to help out with this cause."
Friday, November 15
Making a wish come true: Friday was a special day for Ethan Reimer, an 18-year-old originally from the Philadelphia area, now living in Florida, who is dealing with cardiomyopathy.
Reimer was the guest of the Steelers and the Make-A-Wish Foundation at the team's practice at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.
"I've always been a Steelers fan," said Reimer. "Just meeting them and seeing them like this is surreal. This is more than I expected.
"I expected to meet maybe one player and talk for 30 seconds in the hallway or something. But this is so much more."
Reimer was greeted by the entire team after practice, getting autographs, taking pictures and spending time chatting.
"I love the culture of the team," said Reimer. "It's just hard work. I love the defense the most. For the past 10 years I have loved them."
Reimer will also attend the Steelers game this week against the Ravens at Acrisure Stadium as a guest of the team.
"I am really excited about the game," said Reimer. "I have been to one before, but nothing this big."
Honoring fallen heroes: Punter Corliss Waitman welcomed a group from TAPS and Survivors Outreach Services to Acrisure Stadium today for a military banner hanging as part of the upcoming Steelers Salute to Service game this week.
Waitman presented the families with banners that will honor their fallen heroes and will hang on Art Rooney Avenue for Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns.
The group enjoyed a luncheon and then spent time with Waitman, visiting and sharing stories.
Tuesday, November 12
Showing appreciation for veterans: Linebacker Patrick Queen spent Tuesday morning at Veterans Place, spending the morning serving breakfast and visiting with the veterans.
Queen has a soft spot in his heart for those who have served, respecting them and the sacrifices they have made for our country.
"Just recently, with social media becoming more of a platform for things that take place, you get to see stuff and see how they're treated," said Queen. "All the stuff they went through in the past, and then them coming back home and the stuff they go through. I feel like we don't take care of them enough.
"I feel like there are way more opportunities out there for us to be able to help those guys out when they come back, having places for them and better ways to help them transition away from that type of life that they had to live.
"And just to say thank you. There is way more we can do, but it's just a little token of appreciation."

Trying to make a difference: The Steelers Social Justice Committee has made a commitment to making a difference in Pittsburgh and beyond, and sometimes that is through discussion, healthy conversations and sharing stories to help others.
That is why they held a panel discussion with local community partners, focused mainly on the juvenile justice system.
Steelers linebacker Elandon Roberts and receiver Calvin Austin III helped to moderate the discussion, while Miles Killebrew, Dan Moore Jr. and Corliss Waitman were also in attendance, as they too wanted to hear the stories and learn more.
The panel was joined by Kevin Richardson of the Exonerated Five, a man who was wrongly convicted of a crime in 1990 and was exonerated in 2002, and has since gone on to use his story to help others, especially the youth.
"He never went in a hole about his situation," said Roberts of Richardson. "Since he was wrongfully convicted, he became a leader, started using his voice. If we want to see each other get better, sometimes we have to take the right step forward. He went from being a quiet kid to a leader. When we get a chance to sponge off of someone like Mr. Richardson, we have to do that, because he is a leader in our community."
The group shared stories of what they have experienced, asked questions and shared advice that will hopefully have a strong impact.
"It is special to me because the youth are the leaders of today and tomorrow," said Austin. "One of the things I want to do is be out there, learn from them and learn about some of the great organizations Pittsburgh has that empowers the youth and helps them."
Among the organizations who took part in the event were Amachi Pittsburgh, Café Momentum, Gwen's Girls and Homeless Children's Education Fund, who all had students on the panel, as well as Action Housing, Auberle, Boys & Girls Club of Western Pa., PA Innocence Project, Pittsburgh Public Schools and The Heyward House.
"Being able to listen to these kid's stories, seeing the community put their arm around these kids, it's an appreciation," said Roberts. "To see what we can do more as players with platforms, as Pittsburgh Steelers, to impact our community, the youth. It was a great experience listening to their stories and getting the inspiration to do more. It's on going, and it's not going to get fixed overnight. Us as a community using our platforms goes a long way."
Over the past month, the Steelers worked with organizations around the city as a part of Youth Justice Action Month to raise awareness about the impact of the justice system on children and the organizations that are working to make a positive impact in the community.
Youth Justice Action Month is an annual campaign where advocates come together to organize digital and in-person events and activities to raise awareness and inspire action on behalf of young people impacted by the justice system.
This year is also the 50th Anniversary of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Action, which is a United States federal law providing formula grants to states that follow a series of federal protections on the care and treatment of youth in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems.

Trick or Treat: Halloween came early for the patients at the Children's Home of Pittsburgh when Spencer Anderson, Thomas Graham Jr., Isaiahh Loudermilk and Aaron Shampklin, all dressed in costumes, stopped by for some Halloween fun.
Instead of the kids coming to get treats, players delivered treats to their rooms and spent time visiting with them and uplifting their spirits.
The Children's Home & Lemieux Family Center, established in 1893, is an independent, nonprofit organization with a mission to promote the health and well-being of infants and children through services that establish and strengthen the family.
Their programs include Adoption & Permanency Services, Child's Way®, the Pediatric Specialty Hospital, the Pediatric VIEW Program, and Counseling. In addition to these programs, they offer free housing for patients and families in their on-site Lemieux Family Center.
The kindness continues: It's been an amazing display of giving back by Cameron Heyward as he wrapped up 'Cam's Kindness Week' on Friday by hosting students from Pittsburgh Obama at the team's practice at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.
Heyward had a group of student athletes at practice to present them with a $15,000 donation to the school to upgrade their locker room and to fund the girls flag football team.
"I just thought it would be a cool way to give back," said Heyward, whose mother, Charlotte, went to Peabody High School, which is now Obama High School. "I know what they're going through."
It was the latest gesture in Heyward's third annual kindness week, where the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year has given back in multiple ways.
"It means a lot to me to continue to take part in the Kindness Week," said Heyward. "I want to continue to empower my community, to continue to give back and say thank you to those who do so much in the community. I also want to do something to help the kids and those who give back all around the city.
"We're affecting a lot of great people and having fun meeting some people this week. Going to Children's Hospital, opening up another Craig's Closet, we had a teacher appreciation dinner. There's a lot of great things for our community and it's just nice to draw attention to that."
Heyward is hoping what he does in the community is something that inspires others to give back, especially his teammates.
"We have a lot of guys that are curious," said Heyward. "I want to provide them with an opportunity to create their own things, just like I learned from guys before. I want them to know that they can make a difference. I think they're learning that. Countless guys in this locker room do so much in the community. Let their stuff prosper and let them just take it to the next level."

Spending time talking: Running back Najee Harris spent time on Thursday evening at the Homeless Children's Education Funds Teen Night at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.
The group meets on a regular basis, and this meeting focused on Youth Justice Action Month.
Throughout the month of October, the Steelers will be working with organizations around the city as a part of Youth Justice Action Month (YJAM) to raise awareness about the impact of the justice system on children and the organizations that are working to make a positive impact in the community.
Youth Justice Action Month (YJAM) is an annual campaign where advocates come together to organize digital and in-person events and activities to raise awareness and inspire action on behalf of young people impacted by the justice system.

Saying thank you: Defensive tackle Cameron Heyward continued to reach out to the community through the latest endeavor in 'Cam's Kindness Week.' On Wednesday night he hosted a Teacher Appreciation Dinner at Acrisure Stadium, giving back to those who do so much for the youth in the community.
The group of teachers were treated to a tour of the Hall of Honor Museum, and Heyward joined them for dinner and made a donation to classroom projects they are a part of.
"Doing this means a lot," said Heyward. "I enjoy it. Being blessed is a blessing. You should always pass on those blessings. To be thankful to just be here is one thing I'm always going to be."
Education is something that has always been important to Heyward, who started the Rufus and Judy Jordan Literacy Program to honor his grandparents. As a part of the program, The Heyward House installed Little Free Libraries beginning in 2020 to help underserved communities in the Pittsburgh area and continue to do so. Heyward made sure the libraries were well stocked, delivering books of all kinds, including ones that touch on social justice, racial equality, financial literacy, and life skills topics.
Rufus Jordan, who was known as 'Pup Pup' to his grandkids, passed away in June 2020, which is what inspired Heyward to launch the program. Rufus had a love of reading and education, serving as a teacher at Carrick High School and then as a founder and Vice President of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, a position he held for more than 35 years. Judy was a Pittsburgh Public Schools teacher for over 30 years before retiring.

Shopping for a cause: As the temperature in Pittsburgh climbed to over 80 degrees on Tuesday, Steelers players were inside preparing for winter.
And it was for a good reason.
As we all know, temperatures in Pittsburgh can drop quickly, so having the proper outwear is paramount, especially for kids.
That's why a group of players took kids from the Steel Valley Salvation Army Corps shopping for a new winter coat, hat, gloves and boots in conjunction with Project Bundle-Up.
"It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces, get them the hats, gloves and things that they need," said long snapper Christian Kuntz. "Giving back starts at the top, with our owners, our head coach, everyone in the organization instills that in us. We want to give back and help this community as much as we can.
"I have seen this in the past. I know we have done it in the past. Now that I get to come and help out, it's special."
The Salvation Army's Project Bundle-Up is a program started by two late Pittsburgh staples, Patricia Rooney, the wife of late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, and Joe DeNardo, the former WTAE-TV weatherman. This is the 39th year for the program and there is one thing that has been consistent all along, the day is special for the kids and the players alike.
"It feels great to be a part of something that has been going on for so long, started by such a great family," said defensive lineman Isaiahh Loudermilk. "To be able to be here and help it continue, it's a great honor."
Through Project Bundle-Up, children up to 18 years old and seniors 62 and over are eligible for assistance to purchase warm winter outwear. Since the program began, more than $17 million has been raised and provided outerwear for nearly 305,000 individuals, with 5,000 individuals assisted annually.
"Just how much the Steelers enjoy being here with the kids was special," said Major Philip Lloyd of the Salvation Army. "I think the players got as much out of today as the kids."
And he wasn't kidding.
The players, including Kuntz, Loudermilk, Calvin Anderson, Keeanu Benton, Terrell Edmunds, Pat Freiermuth, Thomas Graham Jr., Nick Herbig, John Leglue, Tyler Matakevich, Ayo Oyelola, Aaron Shampklin, Corliss Waitman and Rodney Williams, had what they even described as the 'time of their lives,' and some promised to come back next year because it was so much fun.
"This is an awesome event," said linebacker Nick Herbig. "The fact that we get to partner with them, get the kids right for the winter, nice and warm and looking fresh.
"You get to this point in your life and all you can do is give back and help the community out."
There is no question the help is needed. Project Bundle-Up provides for those where the need is strongest, and that need continues to grow every year.
"If anything, the need is probably greater now," said Lloyd. "Unfortunately, the need is never slowing down. We could never do this without the help of the community and with partners like the Steelers.
"It's just a great day."
Making their day: The fun, and of course the kindness, continued on Tuesday when Cameron Heyward embarked on the second day of "Cam's Kindness Week."
Heyward, along with his brother, tight end Connor Heyward, visited UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh where he took part in games and activities with the patients in the hospital's Atrium and also took part in Kindness Bingo in the hospital's studio, which patients could play throughout the hospital via their television monitors and call in and talk to Heyward when they won.
Heyward also handed out blankets to the kids, something to keep them warm and cuddly during the time in the hospital.
Visiting the patients at the hospital is always special for Heyward, as he was a patient there when he was a kid, dealing with asthma, seizures and allergies.
"I enjoy going back there," said Heyward. "Those kids there, they're just happy to see everybody. Some can't leave. Some can. But it's really special to interact and have a little bit of fun."
Heyward, the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year, kicked off the week by opening a new 'Craig's Closet' at West Mifflin High School and visiting The Caring Place, where he spent time with grieving kids and families.
"When I talk about the work not being done, it's not like you get a trophy and just stop," said Heyward. "It's about continuing the fight, continuing to make sure your community is better than when you left it and continuing to keep having each other's backs.
"Sometimes we can get enamored by I've done my job, now let me stop. I have a community here that cares a lot about me, and I care a lot about them and I want to make sure I do my part."

Showing he cares: "Cam's Kindness Week" continued on Monday evening when Cameron Heyward visited The Caring Place, a center for grieving children and their families.
He spoke to the kids about dealing with the grief of losing his father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, when he was just a teenager, and let them know he understands how real the pain is.
Heyward opened up about the pain he went through with the loss of his father for the first time last year, and doing so again this year with a different group was helpful not just for the kids, but for him as well.
"It's a cathartic approach where you get to share more of what's going on, what I've been through and then hear the kid's stories," said Heyward. "I want to let them know that you're not alone. These kids have so much strength, but they're also looking for answers. If I can provide some and share what I've done, it means a lot."
Heyward spoke to the group, but also took time to individually talk to the kids, checking in on them to make sure they are okay. He also made remembrance candles with the kids to help them honor their loved ones.
"I just want them to know I care," said Heyward.
Kicking off Cam's Kindness Week: Cameron Heyward believes in giving back to the community that has given so much to him.
And that is exactly why Heyward is doing his third annual "Cam's Kindness Week," a time for the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year to spread love, joy and kindness throughout the Pittsburgh community.
Heyward kicked things off on Monday morning when he took part in opening the latest installation of Craig's Closet, this one at West Mifflin Area High School, where art students worked to design the area.
"I'm just appreciative of coming to a school where the teachers and students go out of their way to help out their community and students," said Heyward. "To see this space that is so welcoming, I am overjoyed to take part in it.
"It means a lot that the students took the initiative to get this done and the staff supported it. It's one thing for us to barge in, but when the students are going above and beyond, it means a lot more. It shows they care about their community, about the kids who come through. They want everybody to succeed, not just themselves. You can go a long way when you have friends like that."
Heyward launched Craig's Closet in 2018 to honor his father, the late Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, who died of brain cancer at age 39. Heyward played football at the University of Pittsburgh, and when he arrived as a freshman running back, he had only one suit, something he was grateful to at least have coming from a single-parent home with six siblings.
With so many young men in Pittsburgh facing the same challenge of not having a suit that they could wear to a job interview, their internship, events and more, Heyward came up with a plan. Craig's Closet provides free dress clothes to help young men as they move forward in life, with them having the opportunity to select their own clothing.
"For me, kicking it off with Craig's Closet is not just a nod to my dad, but it's saying we want to keep going forward and we see this as one way we really do give back. This is one way we go above and beyond saying our students matter, our communities matter. It's not just get a suit, and be done. It's get a suit, and we want to see the progress you made, we want to see what you go out and do in the world, what you want to accomplish."

Spreading some joy: Steelers rookies were having a good time on Tuesday morning, visiting patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
The rookies spent time playing games with the kids, doing art projects and posing for pictures in the hospital's Fred Rogers Atrium.
It is the latest project for the team's rookie class, who are committed to giving back to the community throughout the season.

Hitting close to home: For Larry Ogunjobi, STEM programs are something that are personal to him, something that he studied in college at the University of Charlotte.
So, for him to be able to host a NIKE Stem x Shoe event today and share the importance of programs that are enhanced by advanced technology was extremely meaningful.
"I just think the trajectory of the world and how technology is moving in such a big way, it's good to get the kids involved," said Ogunjobi. "I think everything we have, everything we do is technologically based. I feel like when you start them early it gives them a chance to work through things.
"It caters to the importance of it all. We live in a world where everything that we touch and everything we do is technology. Maximizing that and exposing children early is really cool."
Ogunjobi had a double major in computer science and biology while at Charlotte, something that continues to help him with continuing advancement in technology.
"It gives me a different level of dialog when I speak to people and it's a different kind of conversation starter," said Ogunjobi. "All the stuff that is going on with AI, all the different advancements, it helps you get a leg up on things."
Taking time to listen: The Steelers continued their 'Meeting at the 50-Yard Line' program on Tuesday, visiting Penn Hills High School.
Receiver Calvin Austin III and defensive back Thomas Graham Jr. were on hand to talk with the kids and more importantly, listen to them.

Giving kids hope: Steelers General Manager Omar Khan took part in a Hispanic Heritage Month program at Arsenal Middle School on Thursday morning, along with Roberto Clemente Jr., the son of late Pittsburgh Pirates great Roberto Clemente.
Khan spoke to students, many who are immigrants, some who recently arrived in the United States and are looking for guidance as they are on a path that is new to them, with many just starting to learn the English language.
Pittsburgh Arsenal 6-9 is an English as a second language regional center that provides support for students who are new to the English language while providing access to the mainstream curriculum.
"The main thing that I emphasized is the importance of having big dreams and chasing their dreams, so they have something to look forward to in the future," said Khan. "I also told them life doesn't get easier. Every day, it gets harder.
"One of the things that's always been important for me is I had great people around me to help support me through the years.
"I emphasized how important it was for all of them in that room, even if they come from different backgrounds, different experiences, how they got here. They need to stick together, and they need to look out for each other because if they do it together, they're going to get through these hard times right now with each other, united."
Both Khan and Clemente spoke to the students in Spanish, putting everyone in a comfortable setting where all could understand the message and take part on the conversation, which included a Q&A session with the them.
The visit was done in conjunction with CHAMP, which provides an integrated mentorship and well-being for a community of underrepresented minority (URM) medical and middle school students. The mentorship provides a bridge program between UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Graduate Medical Education and its Office of Diversity, local mentorship program, community organizations, and local government agencies for URM medical students in Pittsburgh and Arsenal Middle School.
"I saw some of the kids look up at me when I told them I have two immigrant parents," said Khan. "For them, that was a wow, he does moment. I talked about how important it was for me to never forget some of the things that I've witnessed growing up and things I experienced.
"What Children's Hospital does with this program is just phenomenal because it gives those kids some insight into the real world. The world most of those kids have grown up seeing is not the same one that they're going to face here in the United States. This is so important. I can't give enough credit to them for what they're doing."
Khan's mother was born in Honduras and his father in India, and while they met in the United States, Khan understands the struggles those who immigrate to this country face.
"Any opportunity I have to help a young person with their future, I'm always going to do whatever I can do because I always appreciated it when people did that for me," said Khan. "If you go back 30 years and the people I was around then, a majority of the people probably would never have expected that I'd be sitting where I'm sitting right now. Any time I can help those kids, I'm going to do whatever I can.
"I just want to give them hope. What I noticed today with some of those kids, they're searching for hope. They haven't found hope because of where they are from, how they got here and some of the stuff that they've faced in their lives. They're searching for hope.
"If I can give at least one of those kids just a little bit of hope, I'm going to do everything I can."

Reaching out to area youth: Steelers players were out and about in the community today, using their off day to give back in numerous manners.
Calvin Austin III and Thomas Graham Jr. spent time at Café Momentum, where they met with Liz Ryan, the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for the United States.
Café Momentum Pittsburgh is a place where Pittsburghers can go and enjoy fine dining. It also offers a culinary internship to teens 15 to 19 who are justice-involved. Café Momentum, which originated in Dallas, provides a transformative experience through a 12-month paid post-release internship program. Participants rotate through the restaurant, focusing on life and social skills, coaching and development.
Cooking for a cause: As a part of breast cancer awareness month, and in conjunction with the NFL's Crucial Catch initiative, Steelers players took part in the annual Healthy Cooking Demo with UPMC.
Isaiahh Loudermilk and DeShon Elliott led the cooking demo at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, making it a fun and meaningful afternoon for breast cancer patients and survivors.
The players prepared healthy food options, giving a variety of tasty, yet healthy treats.
"Nutrition to me is important," said Elliott. "It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle. I prefer to eat healthy."
For Loudermilk, being part of the cooking class is personal as his mother, Stacy Howell, is a breast cancer survivor.
"It means a lot to me," said Loudermilk of taking part in the cooking class. "I'm personally affected by it, growing up with my mom having breast cancer. Being able to come out here now and educate myself on making these healthy meals, and putting smiles on faces is always a great time. It means a lot to me to be here."
Loudermilk said he is simple when it comes to his cooking style, while Elliott has worked on perfecting his cooking skills.
What they both have perfected, though, is giving back to the community.
"As much as God has blessed me, I do my due diligence to give back to the community," said Elliott. "Why not bring happiness and joy to them."

School days: Linebacker T.J. Watt and his wife Dani were busy on Tuesday, visiting multiple schools in the Pittsburgh area as part of the Steelers back to school blitz.
Watt began his day at Pittsburgh King, where he read to the students and then handed out supply bags to help the kids in the school year.
"It's fun. It really is," said Watt. "To see the excitement, to feel the excitement, I haven't been around a bunch of screaming kids at 9:30 in the morning ever.
"It's fun to be able to do it with Dani. Having a little one on the way, it puts things more into perspective about people who are less fortunate and don't have the school supplies or the toiletries to be able to go to school and not have to worry about those things, and that's what we're trying to provide.
"It's such a busy time of year, but it's so important on these Tuesdays, our off days, that we take the time to get out in the community and show people that we're not just on television and we are separated. I want to bridge that gap and show people that we care, and we want to help them as much as possible."
It was then off to Pittsburgh Milliones where he took questions from the kids and again handed out supply bags.
"That was funny. They asked my favorite class, and I don't have a favorite class if I am being honest with anyone," said Watt. "The questions, it's always surreal when kids are nervous to ask questions. I have to remember, to them I am some big guy. But I am such a normal goofball that I forget that sometimes. The kids had great questions, and it was fun to be able to answer some of them."
Watt did the event in conjunction with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources.
Golf for a cause: Pat Freiermuth, Jalen Elliott and Rodney Williams took part in the annual Tee Up Fore Bundle-Up Mini Golf Classic at Puttshack Pittsburgh.
The fun event included a competitive nine-hold round of miniature golf, dinner and prizes all benefitting Project Bundle-Up.
The Salvation Army's Project Bundle-Up is a program started by two late Pittsburgh staples, Patricia Rooney, the wife of late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, and Joe DeNardo, the former WTAE-TV weatherman. The program is focused on providing winter outwear for kids and others in need in the Pittsburgh area and focusing on taking them shopping to pick out their own items.

A wish comes true: Friday was a special day for Bryant Sanchez, a 19-year-old from Orange County, Ca., who was the guest of the Steelers and the Make-A-Wish Foundation at the team's practice at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.
Sanchez, who has leukemia, got to enjoy watching practice up close and personal, as well as meet some of his favorite players following practice, which included getting plenty of pictures and autographs.
"This is really exciting," said Sanchez. "Just because I am here with my family, this is my first time seeing the Steelers here at a home game. I have never been to a game before. This is exciting."
Sanchez will also attend the Steelers game this week against the Chargers at Acrisure Stadium as a guest of the team.
"At first I wanted my wish to just be a jersey," said Sanchez. "I felt like I would end up getting too sick coming here. But being here is just different.
"I never really knew about football until a friend of mine told me to join football with him. My cousin was a Steelers fan, so I went with them.
"I am pretty stoked to go to the game. My family and I, we never really do anything like this so it's awesome."

Fighting hunger: Steelers rookies spent Tuesday morning visiting the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, an organization that is making a massive difference in the region.
The rookies toured the facility, which now includes The Market, an onsite pantry where recipients can select their own items and there is no judgement, and all are treated with dignity and respect. The items are all available at no cost and include fresh produce, meats, shelf-stable foods and more.
The players also took part in packing produce for distribution, giving them a unique understanding of what is needed to help those who are struggling with food insecurity.
Taking care of kids: Tight end Pat Freiermuth has always been passionate about giving back to the Pittsburgh community, loving the ability to interact with others, especially with kids while bringing them joy.
That is why he was out and about on his off day, providing school supplies to students at Pittsburgh Mifflin to aid them in the school year.
Freiermuth worked hand-in-hand with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources.

Heroes night out: The Steelers hosted the annual Heroes Night Out at Acrisure Stadium, honoring the men and women of the military by providing a fun night of football drills with some of their favorite players, as well as camaraderie with others who have or are currently serving our country.
The team worked with local branches of the military, including the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.
"We're really excited to take part in events like this in the community and also bring the different branches together," said Master Sgt. Starsha Jyachosky of the U.S. Army. "It's nice to be thought of like this. It makes us feel like we are part of the community to be asked to come out to an event like this. We are having some fun banter back and forth and it's awesome.
"There is a smile on everybody's face. It's so much fun to take part in this.
"It means the world to service members to do this. It's something a lot of them don't get to do. To be invited down here and interact with the players is a once in a lifetime opportunity for a lot of them."
The event traditionally has been held in the days leading up to or after the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and as part of that there was a somber moment of silence to honor all of the lives that were lost on the horrific day.
While those who were lost were still on their minds, the members of the military were able to relax as well and enjoy a night that was focused solely on them.
Three football stations, including passing, receiving and field goal kicking, were set up around the field, a perfect opportunity for the military members to test their skill level with those who do it for a living.
Among the players taking part were Keeanu Benton, Jalen Elliott, Thomas Graham Jr., Christian Kuntz and Isaiahh Loudermilk.
In addition to the drills, the players posted for pictures with the military members as they shared stories of watching football while on deployment.
"It's important because they give of their time to do well by us," said Benton. "I feel like by any means, if I can do the same, I will do it. being out here giving back.
"It's about the interaction for me. Not that I can't teach them skills, but the interaction part is something they don't get to do every day with NFL players.
"This just goes to show the culture we have here with the Steelers, making ourselves available to do things like this."

Back to school blitz continues: Defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi continued the spirit of helping kids heading back to the classroom when he hosted his third annual Back To School event. Ogunjobi provided backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh.
"I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year," said Ogunjobi. "Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students."
Ogunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their S.T.E.M. program, something that hits home for him as he earned his degree in computer science and biology from North Carolina Charlotte.
"The Urban Academy community thanks Larry and the Pittsburgh Steelers for their ongoing commitment to our students and community," said Chase Patterson, CEO of Urban Academy. "For the third consecutive year, Larry's generosity is making a difference in supporting our student's success. Larry and the Steelers organization continue to demonstrate their overarching dedication to uplifting and investing in young people's futures. On behalf of the entire Urban Academy family, thank you for your unwavering support and partnership."

Back to school ready: Safety DeShon Elliott has already immersed himself in the Pittsburgh community, hosting a back-to-school event for area students on Thursday evening.
"The kids are our pillars. Growing up, football was important to me, but my parents also preached education," said Elliott. "I am not just doing back to school supplies, but clothes and shoes too. It's hard for parents, especially single parent homes, and I have two sisters who are single mothers, and it can be hard to try and provide everything you need for school. That takes a burden off the kids and the moms. The kids can then just focus on their education.
"And this is an opportunity for me to give back to my hometown, which is now here."
Elliott took a group of kids shopping for their back-to-school needs as well as shoes and clothes, making sure they are set for the new school year. He also spent time interacting with the kids, being present, which is sometimes one of the most important aspects.
"It means a lot," said Elliott. "I am giving back, but being there, showing up, that means a lot to kids. Being able to talk to them, and them learning from me, who I am, answering questions. Talking to kids about football, other things. I just want to be hands on and really get to know them."

Making back to school cool: Linebacker Alex Highsmith hosted his 3rd Annual Back to School Bash for 300 area students at the LaRosa Youth Club in McKeesport.
Highsmith handed out backpacks, books and school supplies to the students through the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation. In addition, the foundation provided free haircuts, water bottles, and to-go meals to provide the kids a nutritious option as the school year is set to begin.
"We are incredibly excited to host this event once again and to continue our mission of giving back to the community," said Highsmith. "Providing these resources helps ensure that every child has the tools they need to succeed academically and start the school year with confidence."
Back to school in style: The new school year is about to get underway for many kids in the area, and the importance of sending kids back to the classroom with all the necessities is definitely a priority.
That is why the Steelers joined forces with others to be a part of the 12th Annual Pittsburgh Public Schools Back to School Event at Acrisure Stadium.
This year, Cameron Heyward's foundation, The Heyward House, and Russell Wilson's Why Not You Foundation, are working hand-in-hand with the team and the Mentoring Partnership to provide support for kids and families, with the theme, 'Students first…Always, in all ways.'
To give the kids a fresh start for school, the Steelers provided haircuts, hairstyles and manicures, giving everyone a self-esteem boost. Working with The Heyward House and Why Not You Foundation, they also provided hygiene kits and books. In addition, they connected the students with much needed resources that will benefit them throughout their educational endeavors.
Students were able to attend the event in person and take advantage of all of the activities, or participate in the drive-thru version where they were able to still get free school supplies and other essentials without having to leave their car.
The event was also something the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation were a part of.
Join us on Friday, October 4 to be a part of the largest and most anticipated fundraising event of the year, #SteelersStyle ! Buy tickets ⤵️

The organization engages elementary, middle and high-school-aged youth in becoming the leaders of tomorrow while serving the community.

"One of the things that we've done is connected with other youth organizations around Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington County, Greene County, Westmoreland County. So, we have a broader reach now. We're able to work and be more effective, reaching more kids. It gives kids, even kids who are not in the system, an opportunity to experience what our program has to offer and help them grow and develop."
The idea behind the visit is to help inspire the kids who are taking part and teach the importance of teamwork as the kids go through a series of physical challenges designed for them to work together in teams.

Flag football fun: Steelers Hall of Fame safety Troy Polamalu and his wife, Theodora, hosted the inaugural Resilience Bowl at Acrisure Stadium on Tuesday.
The evening was highlighted by a seven-on-seven flag football game, featuring an array of former Steelers players like Jerome Bettis, Ben Roethlisberger and Hines Ward, as well as celebrities such as rapper Fedd the God, actor and comedian Billy Gardell, and actor/musician Chip Esten.
Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and Hall of Famer and former Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau served as the coaches for the game.
The competition was intense, with Polamalu's team coming out on top.
"It's the city that is hosting us tonight in a lot of ways. In that mindset, I am very grateful to be back, to see all of the faces here, to see the team," said Polamalu. "It's nice to be back in the fold in a very meaningful way. We do a lot of charitable work for the community, but to come back here, bring back the alumni, give back to the team."
The event benefits the Neighborhood Resilience Project, an organization the Steelers have a strong bond with.
"Considering the Neighborhood Resilience Project, and the Neighborhood Resilience Institute, and the amazing things they have done, this is great to be a part of," said Polamalu. "The Resilience Project, first and foremost it's a framework that allows the community to heal within. Oftentimes, when people look at trauma, especially the case of trauma in communities, you have a separate figure that is trying to impose certain programs on a community. Some of them are helpful, some not so helpful. The beautiful thing about the Neighborhood Resilience Project is that it's healing from within. It's a framework that allows people that live in the community to talk to people in positions of power, and then they become people of power, and enlighten us to bring healing to the community."
The organization brought hundreds of kids from the Greater Pittsburgh region to enjoy a night where they can see Steelers legends up close.
"This night means so much to them," said Rev. Paul T. Abernathy, CEO of Neighborhood Resilience Project. "For them to have a chance to see some of the Steelers legends, Super Bowl champions, Hall of Famers. It's bringing so much excitement to our youth.
"This event is so fun. Just to have an event this fun and offer it as a night of enjoyment for our region to come together and celebrate all that people in our community have accomplished establishing resiliency, it's just incredible."
The vision of the Neighborhood Resilience Project is to inspire a movement in which suffering people are raised up from the ashes of trauma in unconditional love to become empowered healers, community builders, and positive change makers. The project is rooted in the Gospel and teachings of the Orthodox Church, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s.
"This has been a tremendous blessing to us," said Rev. Abernathy. "Troy and Theodora Polamalu are truly gems, not only for our organization, but the entire community. The Steelers organization is showing us tonight that as a region we can come together, we can remember those who are suffering the most among us. We can as a region, with this kind of leadership from the Steelers and the Polamalus heal the pain in our communities. This is inspiring so many people in our community. The excitement in our underserved community is beyond words, it's bringing new life to us all."

Celebrating a special day: Last year, Miles Killebrew wanted to do something special for his 30th birthday, and for someone who isn't a fan of big parties and a lot of attention, he found the perfect way to celebrate.
He enjoyed it so much, he opted for the same celebration this year.
Instead of making his birthday celebration all about himself, he celebrated his birthday, which is May by hanging out with patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, hanging out and delivering gifts to unsuspecting kids.
It was a great day for the kids, who were smiling from ear to ear as their spirits picked up with the fun surprise, which included Killebrew dressing up as Batman.
Wednesday, May 8
Birthday time: Defensive tackle Cameron Heyward celebrated his birthday on Monday, but on Wednesday, he threw a party for others.
Heyward hosted his annual birthday bash at Dave & Busters for a group of local kids, including many who are served through The Caring Place.
The kids were able to play video games with Heyward and some of his teammates, as well as enjoy dinner and just have fun interacting with each other.
The Caring Place an organization he has been involved with, including as part of Cam's Kindness Week last year.
The Caring Place offers programs to support children and families who are grieving after a devastating loss. And the statistics are sad, as one in 20 kids will have a parent die before they graduate from high school. Heyward is one of those statistics and that is why he wanted to give back. His father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward died when he was just 16-years old, the summer before his senior year of high school.
Very thankful to have @steelers teammates, @97HeywardHouse @CaringPlacePa all partner up to spend some time @ Dave & Busters for some pretty great kids!!!

Smiles all around: Quarterback Russell Wilson brought smiles, and Terrible Towels, to patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on Tuesday.
Wilson stopped by the hospital to visit with the kids, something that lifted the spirits of everyone he spent time with. And Wilson himself had a fantastic time.
"What I have learned is that much is given, much is required," said Wilson. "I believe that."
During the visit, Wilson took time to learn more about each one of the kids, learn about their ability to fight through adversity as some have gone beyond what doctors could have ever expected in their health battles.
"It's about their fight," said Wilson. "It's inspiring to see that. To see the mentality. It's important not only for me, but so many of us other athletes to be able express how much these young kids mean to us.
"The thing I always realized, doing a lot of things with cancer, and things like that for kids, you realize that number one you never know if it's somebody you know, number two you never know if it's somebody that could be yours one day. To be able to give back and be able to impact is important."
Wilson is no stranger to giving back in this manner, something he did previously in other cities where he has played and something he truly does from the heart.
"My dad was always in hospitals, my mom was an ER nurse," said Wilson. "I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of miracles happen too. I've seen a lot of good things happen.
"When you go into a room with a lot of love, a lot of hope, anything is possible. When you have great doctors and nurses and people that are spending so much time for these young, amazing kids, you want to cherish those moments."
Amazing visit today @ChildrensPGH !!! The sweetest kids! Keep fighting! Keep overcoming! 🖤💛 pic.twitter.com/4aGtY2ht4s

Set for success: Cameron Heyward and The Heyward House hosted the annual Suiting Up for Success Soiree at the Grand Concourse, celebrating the accomplishments of local high school seniors.
Heyward celebrated male high school seniors in the Pittsburgh area, all chosen by their schools for their leadership, character and ability to overcome challenges faced by today's youth. The Heyward House provided each of them with a custom suit and all the accessories through his 'Craig's Closet' program, as well as a photo shoot and a private dinner with Heyward.
The program is one of the many that earned Heyward the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.
Craig's Closet has been a staple for The Heyward House since 2018, launched in honor of his late father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, who died from a brain tumor in 2006, at just 39 years old.
His father played football at the University of Pittsburgh, and when he arrived as a freshman running back, he had only one suit, something he was grateful to have since he came from a single-parent home with six siblings.
With so many young men in Pittsburgh facing the same challenge of not having a suit that they could wear to a job interview, internship, events and more, Heyward produced a plan. Craig's Closet provides free dress clothes to help young men as they move forward in life, and the Suiting Up for Success program is an extension of that.
"The idea came from my dad," said Heyward. "When he grew up, he only had one suit. A lot of his friends didn't have suits at all. This is a creative way we thought of to give back to the community and help prepare young men for jobs, or homecoming, moving forward in life. You never know how much a suit can help you present yourself."
Wednesday, April 10
Cam Heyward Day: Wednesday was declared 'Cam Heyward Day' in the City of Pittsburgh, honoring the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year.
Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Pittsburgh City Council presented him with a proclamation for his work that has benefited so many in the city.
"I just want to thank you for all of the work that you have done," said Gainey. "You have done a lot of work in the city. I am appreciative, because it speaks volumes of how you use your platform. I always think you should use your platform to uplift other people, and you have done that. I just want to personally say thank you.
"And I like the way you tackle quarterbacks. I appreciate that."
Gainey went on to read the proclamation honoring Heyward for winning the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award, recognizing him for his on and off the field efforts.
"He is among the most respected names in the National Football League," the proclamation read. "Throughout his 13-year career he has been deeply involved in helping the community and always using his platform for good. Throughout his distinguished career, Cam has exemplified the highest standards of professionalism, compassion and consistency, going above and beyond the call of duty, and providing life-changing care for support of youth throughout the region.
"Today is your day. We appreciate you. Today is Cam Heyward Day."
Heyward, who has been a staple in the community since he was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft, was humbled to be honored by the city when he was born and played his entire career.
"Thank you to Mayor Gainey, (City) Council, and everybody out here today," said Heyward. "When I talk about using my platform to draw awareness or help others out, that's not accomplished without a village behind me. It's not done without people taking an effort to give back. I would like to think I am a representative of that.
"I am very appreciative of this proclamation. When I tell my kids today is Cam Heyward Day, they might freak out a little bit and hopefully I can get a cupcake on top of that. My kids, I am just trying to show them the way and I am trying to lead my family and provide for them a model of how to represent your city. Not everybody gets to be a Pittsburgh Steeler, but when you are a Pittsburgh Steeler, there is a level of consistency, a standard to be held and a responsibility to the city. That is something I will always do. We've got a lot more work to do, and I am looking forward to doing it."
Saturday, April 6
Alex Highsmith Day: Steelers linebacker Alex Highsmith had his day in the sun when Wilmington, North Carolina celebrated 'Alex Highsmith Day' on April 6.
Highsmith, who grew up in Wilmington, was recognized by Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo for his work on and off the field.
Highsmith was honored in particular for his work with the Highsmith Family Foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement and enrichment of underserved youth, professional development of our nation's educators, and providing opportunities for growth and connection to flourish. The foundation does work in Wilmington, Pittsburgh, and Charlotte, where he attended college. He also works closely with the Barbara Highsmith Reading Academy.
"God has blessed me with this platform, to just be a light for him and do it all for his glory," said Highsmith. "So, knowing that the main reason I have this platform is not just to play football but to make a difference and be a blessing to others. Knowing that I have this platform, I know it comes with great responsibility and that is to give back to others and make a difference."
Highsmith is committed to the Pittsburgh community as well, hosting events for various organizations, while attending team and community events in an effort to give back and make a difference.
"Ultimately, I know that I can make a lasting difference in the community," said Highsmith. "Just by going out and doing different things with the kids and being a role model for them, that's what matters to me most."

5 for Friday: Senior Bowl begins the offseason process
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Senior Bowl practices will kick off on Tuesday in Mobile, Ala., and are worth keeping an eye on for NFL draftniks.
Last year, 10 of the players who participated at the Senior Bowl were selected in the first round of the draft, including Steelers' first-round pick Troy Fautanu. There were 35 players from the 2024 Senior Bowl selected in the second and third rounds of the draft, including center Zach Frazier and wide receiver Roman Wilson, the team's second and third-round picks.
By the completion of the draft, 110 players who participated in the 2024 Senior Bowl had been drafted. Included in that group was Steelers' fourth-round selection, linebacker Payton Wilson.
The Steelers' four selections from the Senior Bowl roster might sound like a lot, but there were eight teams that selected five or more players from the 2024 game.
Now, this is not to say the Steelers' first-round or any of their draft picks will come from this year's Senior Bowl roster. But given how solid a group of players the Senior Bowl is scheduled to have in attendance this year, there's a good chance that one or two of the players – if not more – who are on the practice field next week will be future Steelers.
For example, there were 12 quarterbacks selected in last year's draft. Eight of them were at the Senior Bowl.
Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin always takes an active role at the Senior Bowl practices. That included last season when Tomlin challenged cornerback Quinyon Mitchell and Wilson at wide receiver to work one-on-one against each other as much as possible at their practices because they were two of the top guys at their respective positions on the rosters.
Also on Wilson's North roster were Florida's Ricky Pearsall, who ended up being selected by the 49ers in the first round, and Luke McCaffery of Rice, a third-round pick of the Commanders.
Of the Steelers' rookies who were at the Senior Bowl last season, the team knows the least at this point about Roman Wilson.
He suffered an ankle injury early in training camp and missed the entire preseason. Wilson made it back, practiced for a few weeks and finally saw action in the Steelers' Week 6 win at Las Vegas, playing five snaps to get his feet wet.
Unfortunately, the following week, he injured his hamstring during practice and landed on the Reserve/Injured List until having his 21-day practice window opened late in the season.
Tomlin thought enough of Wilson at the Senior Bowl a year ago to want him to match up against Mitchell, who wound up being a first-round pick of the Eagles and is a finalist for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.
The 2025 season will be a very important one for Wilson, not that it won't be for the other Steelers rookies.
A big jump is expected for all of the team's rookies from Year 1 to Year 2. You can bet that Tomlin challenged Wilson at his season-ending exit meeting with him to be that guy he identified a year ago at the Senior Bowl.
Wilson accepted that challenge a year ago. The guess here is that he'll tackle this challenge, as well.
• While the players considered the top two quarterbacks in this year's draft, Cam Ward of Miami (Fla.) and Shedeur Sanders of Colorado, aren't going to be at the Senior Bowl next week, several of the prospects who are in the running to be selected after those two are going to be there.
That group includes Alabama's Jalen Milroe, Will Howard of Ohio State, Jaxson Dart of Mississippi and Oregon's Dillon Gabriel. Howard, along with Notre Dame's Riley Leonard, who also is on the list to attend the Senior Bowl, just played in the national championship game last Monday night, so it will be interesting to see if he still attends. But it's a good group of quarterbacks.
Beyond the quarterback position, other strong groups include the running backs, wide receivers, edge rushers, defensive tackles and defensive backs.
Cameron Skattebo of Arizona State, Devin Neal of Kansas, Oklahoma State's Ollie Gordon III, Auburn's Jarquez Hunter and Damien Martinez of Miami (Fla.) are among some of the top running backs at this year's Senior Bowl.
At wide receiver, Epic Ayomanor, Xavier Restrep of Miami (Fla.), Savion Williams of TCU, Utah State's Jalen Royals and Jayden Higgins of Iowa State highlight a solid group.
Among the defensive linemen expected to attend are Shemar Stewart and Shemar Turner of Texas A&M, Walter Nolen of Mississippi, Kentucky's Deon Walker, T.J. Sanders of South Carolina, Alfred Collins of Texas and Omarr Norman-Lott of Tennessee.
At edge rusher, Texas A&M's Nic Scourton, Mississippi's Princely Unanmielen and Jared Ivey, Landon Jackson of Arkansas, South Carolina's Kyle Kennard and Donovan Ezeiruaku headline a deep and talented group.
Among the defensive backs slated to participate are Trey Amos of Ole Miss, Maxwell Hairston of Kentucky, Azareye'h Thomas of Florida State, Darien Porter of Iowa State, Xavier Watts of Notre Dame and Andrew Mukuba of Texas.
• With the quarterbacks on hand at the Senior Bowl, next week will be a critical one for the Steelers.
The Steelers don't have any of their three quarterbacks from 2024 under contract for the 2025 season. And while that's likely to change, bringing back the entire group might be unrealistic.

At some point, after all, the Steelers have to take another shot at acquiring a potential quarterback of the future. Even if the Steelers do re-sign either Russell Wilson or Justin Fields as their starter for 2025, they still could be in the market to add a rookie to the group.
They likely won't have an opportunity to select Ward or Sanders, who are expected to be among the top five, if not the top two, picks in the upcoming draft.
But the next group of quarterbacks in this draft will largely be at the Senior Bowl. And it will be the first opportunity for Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan to get a live look at that group in person.
Maybe the Steelers won't be enamoured with anyone from that group. But maybe they will find one or two who intrigue them as prospects.
The team's scouts will have done the initial legwork on all of the players who will be in attendance at the all-star games. The next step is allowing the coaching staff to get eyes on that group and see their practice habits and more as the interview process begins.
• When the Steelers and Tomlin talk about "turnover culture," they're not just speaking about something that is nonsensical.
Teams that have won the turnover margin in the 2024 postseason are 7-0 in the playoffs. Since 2022, the team that has won the turnover margin is 20-1, with the only loss coming by the Bills against the Chiefs in an AFC Divisional game, 27-24. The Bills were plus-1 in that game.
Kansas City, meanwhile, has won an astounding 37 consecutive games in which it has won the turnover margin.
Having Patrick Mahomes helps, but so does winning the turnover margin.
Buffalo, meanwhile, is at plus-27 this season, including the playoffs, after winning the turnover margin by two last Sunday against the Ravens.
• Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Pittonline@iheartmedia.com
The Steelers were 8-4 in 2024 when winning the turnover margin. They were 2-3 when they did not win the turnover battle and 0-1 when even in turnover margin, with that loss coming to the Ravens in the postseason.
• Had the favored Ravens won their Divisional Playoff game last weekend in Buffalo – a game they lost, 27-25 – the Steelers would have played all four of the finalists in the conference championship games during the regular season.
In those five meetings with those four teams – they obviously played Baltimore twice – they went 2-3 during the regular season, with the three losses all coming during a stretch from Dec. 15 and Dec. 25, with the first two of those games coming on the road.
The Steelers played the Commanders and Ravens in back-to-back weeks on Nov. 10 and 17 and won both of those games.
And no, the other teams asked to play three games in an 11-day span didn't face quite the same road. While Houston, Baltimore and Kansas City also played three games in 11 days, Houston's first game of that stretch came at home against a struggling Miami Dolphins team. The Ravens played the hapless Giants. Kansas City played the Browns.
The Steelers traveled to Philadelphia.
That doesn't excuse what occurred, with the Steelers losing their final five games, but it certainly was a factor in how it occurred.

Priority will be the QB position
Steelers.com
Steelers President Art Rooney II conducted his end-of-season media briefing on Monday at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, and during a session that touched on a variety of subjects and issues related to the team's 2024 season, he used a form of the word disappointing/disappointment a bunch of times. And it didn't take long for that theme to surface.
"Just a quick few observations to get started," was how Rooney began. "Obviously, it was a disappointing end to the season losing five in a row. Not what we expected, especially after getting off to a good start. We have a lot of work to do to improve going into next year."
When it comes to constructing or reconstructing the roster for the 2025 season, Rooney identified the quarterback situation as Job 1. Since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season, the Steelers have started 5 different quarterbacks. And the two who started all 18 games in 2024 can become unrestricted free agents when the 2025 league year begins on Wednesday, March 12.
Russell Wilson was signed to a 1-year contract after being released by the Denver Broncos, and Justin Fields was acquired in a trade with Chicago and played last season on the final year of the rookie deal he signed as the 11th overall pick of the 2021 NFL Draft.
"After the coaching staff is in place, the priority will be the quarterback position, for sure," said Rooney. "We have some decisions to make there. I thought Russ (Wilson) and Justin (Fields) both showed promise in certain stretches during the season, and I think they're both capable of being starters in this league. So we have decisions, and they have decisions, too."
From the Steelers' standpoint, some of the things potentially being weighed in their decision are age, mobility, pocket presence, job experience, and a grasp of the nuances of what the job requires. From the players' standpoint, the decision might come down to the potential lure of selling their services on the open market.
However that unfolds, Rooney believes there are some specifics of what the job as an NFL starter requires in today's NFL. "I think the quarterback has to be able to read the defense and get the team in a play that's good against the defense he's looking at. No matter if he's mobile or not, that's what you've got to start with."
Added Rooney, "I think they're both capable quarterbacks, and my preference would be to sign one of them. So that will be the priority, and I think that gives us the best opportunity to move forward. Obviously, we'll be looking in the draft as well. We've got a whole quarterback room to fill, so there are jobs open there. I wouldn't be surprised if we looked in the draft as well, either this year or next. And so (quarterback) is going to be a priority."
Handicapping the in-house options: Either/or seems to be a possibly. But both, is probably not happening.
"I wouldn't close the door," said Rooney about re-signing both Wilson and Fields, "but I would say it's probably unlikely. I think both of them see themselves as starters. I don't know if they want to share the same job again next year. I would say most likely we won't wind up bringing both back.
"It's disappointing that Kenny (Pickett) didn't work out to be our long-term quarterback here," said Rooney. "We just have to look at the next opportunity and make sure we do a good job evaluating it the next time around."
Quarterback is the team's top priority, but of more interest to the fans is Rooney's opinion of the job being done by Coach Mike Tomlin.
"When you look at how many games Mike (Tomlin) has won in this league, you don't win that many games if you're not a good coach," said Rooney. "I know he's frustrated, like we all are, just not being able to take that next step. But we still feel good about him being a leader and still think he has the strengths that he always had in terms of being able to lead a team. On the other side of the coin, you look at the fact that we have 6, 7, 8 teams a year that turn their coaches over. It's never a good strategy."
Then came the question: But is Tomlin's message still getting through to the players?
"It's a fair question after losing five in a row, but when I talked to the players, I think the players still want to play for Mike," said Rooney. "So I'm not concerned about his message or that kind of issue."
Speaking of the message, what was his message to Tomlin after the season?
"Disappointment," said Rooney. "We've got to really figure out how we get better and what we need to do to get better. I think he understands – look, Mike knows what the goal is here and what we're shooting for."
Any staff changes?
"We talk about the staff all the time," said Rooney. "So that's a process ongoing. The other things are probably not things I'm ready to talk about here. But we talk about lots of things in terms of how we try to get better."
Other issues brought up during the Q&A was the depth chart at running back, and whether George Pickens is still going to be part of the depth chart at wide receiver.
"Najee (Harris) is a good player," said Rooney, "and we'll evaluate whether we can bring him back. He's going to have choices, too. It's a position that is important to us. Obviously, it's important to some other teams that have had success this year, so maybe (the position) is not as devalued as some might have thought. We have a job opening in that room we're going to have to fill. And whether it's Najee or somebody else, it's going to be an important position."
About Pickens: "I think wide receiver is an area we've got to look at improving. George (Pickens) is a very talented player who has room to grow. We'd like to see him grow and hopefully he realizes the potential that he has, but definitely room for growth there … Every team seems to have one or two guys in that room who you have to manage correctly. I still think George has enough talent that we've got to try to work and see if we can get him to fulfill the talent that he really has. Who knows if we can get there? We'll see. But when you have guys who are as talented as some of the guys you're probably thinking of, you try to work with them and have them help you be successful."
Later he said the team has not talked about a contract extension for Pickens, who will be entering the final year of the contract he signed as a No. 2 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.
And yes, Rooney understands there is discontent within Steelers Nation.
"My inbox has been pretty full. (Laughter) I have a sense," said Rooney, "and I share the frustration. It's very disappointing. I understand why. I understand why people are mad. All I can say is actions speak louder than words, and we've got to be better."

Trice activated from Reserve/Injured List
Steelers.com
The Steelers activated cornerback Cory Trice Jr. from the Reserve/Injured (Designated for Return) List to the 53-man roster.
Trice has been sidelined since injuring his hamstring against the Los Angeles Chargers, seeing action in only three games. He said returning to practice has been a blessing, but now he just wants to play.
"I missed practicing. That's really where the growth comes in that people really don't see," said Trice. "That's where you get better. I missed it a lot, working on my game.
"I have always been preparing like I was going to play week in and week out. Still the same preparation, definitely was exciting mentally to get back to practice.
"Whenever they call me, I've got to be ready. And I'll be ready for sure."
Trice, who was drafted by the Steelers in the seventh round of the 2023 NFL Draft, spent all of last season on the Reserve/Injured List.
Trice recently was selected as the Steelers 2024 Ed Block Courage Award winner, given to a player who has shown courage either coming back from an injury or a life-altering situation.
The team waived running back Jonathan Ward on Wednesday.

Top 2024 Moments: The Wizard of Boz
Steelers.com
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first in a series of articles looking back at some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
Chris Boswell's first field goal of 2024 set a tone.
The next five helped win the regular-season opener.
"Man, we all know what he's capable of," head coach Mike Tomlin insisted regarding Boswell, whose six field goals accounted for all of the Steelers' scoring in an 18-10 triumph over the Falcons on Sept. 8 in Atlanta.
"I don't think anybody in that locker room was surprised by what he was able to do."
The first was from 57 yards away and tied the game at 3-3 with 4:37 left in the first quarter.
Boswell would subsequently strike from 51 and 56 yards out while finishing off his six pack on the way to becoming the first kicker in Steelers' history to register three field goals of 50 yards or longer in a game.
"He wants the long ball," Tomlin insisted. "He's built for it.
"I think it's just really displayed in my confidence in him. I don't have any hesitation to send him out there. As a matter of fact I look forward to sending him out there because I know he relishes it."
Boswell connected on six fields goals in a game for the second time (Dec. 18, 2016 at Cincinnati) and tied for the second time the franchise record for field goals in a game he shared with Jeff Reed (Dec. 1, 2002 at Jacksonville) and Gary Anderson (Oct. 23, 1988 against Denver).
Boswell's sixth field goal against the Falcons, a 25-yard effort with 28 seconds left in regulation, was converted with wide receiver Scotty Miller filling in at holder for injured punter Cameron Johnston.
Boswell also punted once for Johnston, a 43-yard boot on fourth-and-31 from the Steelers' 17-yard line with 3:29 left in the fourth quarter.
"It definitely feels good," Boswell acknowledged. "But we are right back on to the next week.
"Whatever I did this week has no relevance to next week."
Maybe not, but it was definitely the beginning of a trend.
Boswell went 6-for-6 again in an 18-16 victory over the Ravens on Nov. 17 at Acrisure Stadium (including 3-for-3 on attempts of at least 50 yards).
And by the end of the regular season he had authored a campaign that included:
• Boswell scoring 158 points, the most by an NFL kicker since Greg Zuerlein of the Rams in 2017 (158).
• A franchise-record 41 field goals (three shy of San Francisco's David Akers' NFL-record 44 in 2011) on 44 attempts.
• And Boswell emerging with a career success rate of 82.7 percent on field goal attempts of 50 yards or longer, the highest since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger for players with at least 50 attempts.
Boswell was named an Associated Press First-Team Al-Pro for the first time in his 10-year career with the Steelers.
Atlanta, as it turned out, was the appetizer.
"Just having a weapon like him on the offensive side of the ball, we only have to get the ball to the 40-yard line," said Justin Fields, who quarterbacked the Steelers to victory over the Falcons. "It makes our job way easier."

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: March 4
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
ROBERT YEAGER FROM CANYON COUNTRY, CA: Who would you choose as the greatest Steelers player to never win a Super Bowl? My choice would be Rod Woodson, with T.J. Watt a close second. ANSWER: In my opinion, active players never qualify for these kinds of questions until their careers are over, so that eliminates both T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward. Rod Woodson won a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in 2000, and that takes him out of the equation in my mind as well. Also, all of the guys whose Steelers' careers came during the first 40 years of the franchise's existence never had a chance at an NFL Championship, but those players came before Super Bowl I, which was played at the end of the 1966 season. Now that I have set the parameters for myself, there are two players I would consider – Greg Lloyd and Dermontti Dawson. Because Dawson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2012, my choice would be Dawson.
KEN MAULDIN FROM CLYDE, TX: I feel like our receiving corps was the weakest in the NFL. So I am asking you from a statistical standpoint, did our receivers have the worst production in the NFL last season? ANSWER: With the way the NFL is played these days, "receivers" is a term that can include all offensive players who are eligible to catch passes, and tight ends and running backs often are a major component of a team's passing attack. What I know for sure is that in 2024, the Steelers finished the regular season ranked 26th in the NFL in total passing yards and 27th in passing yards per game.
GLEN WHITTEN FROM AGUADILLA, PUERTO RICO: Are there any limits on what a team can pay a coordinator or any other member of the coaching staff? And is it reasonable to imagine that a great coordinator/coach could be enticed to move to another team for the same title but a lot more money? ANSWER: Coaching salaries are not governed by the salary cap, but when it comes to movement from one team to another you should understand that coaches are under contract. And moving from one team to another for the same job but for more money cannot happen if the coach/coordinator is under contract.
TERRY SUCHMA FROM SOUTHPORT, NC: I vaguely recall the Steelers drafting an "edge rusher" named Kendrell Bell back in the day. My recollection is that he had an outstanding rookie season, but pretty much disappeared after that. Wondering whether an injury ended his career? ANSWER: Kendrell Bell came to the Steelers as a No. 2 pick (39th overall) in the 2001 NFL Draft. Bell played linebacker for the Georgia Bulldogs, and won a spot as an inside linebacker in the Steelers' 2-4 alignment. Bell never was an edge player or an outside linebacker in either college or the pros. His rookie season proved to be the highlight of his NFL career. He started all 16 regular season games for the Steelers in 2001 as part of a foursome including OLBs Jason Gildon and Joey Porter, plus Earl Holmes alongside him at ILB. Bell finished with 9 sacks, 1 pass defensed, 1 forced fumble, and 82 combined tackles, and he was voted Defensive Rookie of the Year. Bell was at his best as a downhill ILB attacking the line of scrimmage vs. both the run and the pass, but starting in 2002 opponents changed the way they prepared for the Steelers defense, and Bell didn't really adapt well. That, plus some injuries limited him to 12 games in 2002 and 3 games in 2004. After he was released following the 2004 season, Bell finished with 3 years in Kansas City, and for his career in Pittsburgh he played in 47 of a possible 64 games, with 44 starts and 18 sacks, 1 interception, 6 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries, and 338 combined tackles.
BOBBY BEATY FROM HOPE MILLS, NC: So if we keep Justin Fields, should we also draft a quarterback in the later rounds – say Ohio State's quarterback – who could sit and learn for a year or two? Or do we wait a year or two and try to draft a quarterback on the first round? ANSWER: If the Steelers re-sign Justin Fields or Russell Wilson, I would not spend a premium pick (first three rounds) in the upcoming draft on a quarterback. My opinion would be to go with Wilson/Fields as the starter, try to re-sign Kyle Allen or some other low-cost veteran to be the backup, and possibly spend a third-day pick on a No. 3 guy. I believe you give Wilson/Fields the 2025 season to show what they've got, and then if necessary/desirable look for a quarterback in the first round in 2026.
JOHN REEHER FROM YORK, SC: Back in the 1970s, the Steelers broke the bank with scouting and evaluation. There are exceptions now, of course, but those scouting and evaluation traits have seriously declined. Is this the fault of the Steelers, or has the rest of the NFL simply caught up? ANSWER: I would characterize the Steelers budget for scouting college players all along as being representative of what the rest of the league was/is doing, starting with the 1970s and progressing to the present day. In the 1970s, though, thanks to Bill Nunn, the Steelers weren't opposed to allocating their scouting dollars on the HBCUs, and that was a big part of the talent pipeline for those Super Bowl teams in the 1970s. Now, everybody scouts the HBCUs, and just in general with the technology available there are few if any "sleepers." Every team knows about every player, and then it comes down to fit or just the luck of having a guy available when it's your turn to pick. And I also believe this: the scouting/drafting process is not an exact science, and to some degree the longer you spin that wheel the more often you're going to miss on picks.
GAYLE DYE FROM HOUSTON, TX: I am interested in attending the Steelers game in London this year. A sports travel tours company that is offering packages for the game is advertising the game as being on Sept. 28, 2025. Do they know this for sure or are they just guessing? ANSWER: The NFL has announced that the Steelers will serve as the designated home team for a regular season game in Dublin, not London. The date of that game will be announced this spring, no later than mid-May when the league will announce the dates and times for the regular season.
RENE ORTEGA FROM AZUSA, CA: Do you know an exact date, when packages for the Steelers game in Ireland will be offered? ANSWER: As I explained in the answer above, the date and the opponent for the Steelers game in Dublin has not yet been announced. If you go to Steelers.com, and scroll down the homepage a bit, you'll see an icon titled "Dublin Game." Click on that and you'll be directed to a page that allows you to learn more about what's available and to put your name on a wait list for when details have been firmed up.
DELMAS MAYNARD FROM DINGESS WV: I was just watching TikTok and saw something on there that the Pittsburgh Steelers just signed Tyreek Hill for $250 million. I want to know if it's true because I've never seen the Steelers give anybody that much money. ANSWER: I'm sure there are a lot of interesting things on that social media app, but I don't suggest depending on it for breaking NFL news. Tyreek Hill is a member of the Miami Dolphins, is under contract to that team through the 2026 season, and free agency doesn't begin until 4 p.m. on March 12.
JEFF FRANKS FROM TOLEDO, OH: Do you think Jaylen Warren can/will be the featured RB for the Steelers next season? Will the Steelers sign him to a new contract? ANSWER: Jaylen Warren is due to become a restricted free agent, so what I see happening is the team will tender him an offer with compensation attached, and if he signs an offer sheet with another team the Steelers will either take the draft pick compensation or match the offer sheet and keep him under those terms. Another variable in this is General Manager Omar Khan said from the Combine that the "door is not closed" on bringing Najee Harris back. If that happens I would assume it will be another 1-1a workload distribution for the running backs in 2025.
TONY TURAY FROM SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA: Some draft eligible players choose not to work out at the Combine. Are you aware if that affects Coach Mike Tomlin's or General Manager Omar Kahn's views on drafting these players? ANSWER: As a general rule, I would say it doesn't have a major impact, because the draftable players who choose not to work out at the Combine generally work out at their college's Pro Day. The run-up to the draft is an information gathering process for teams, and as long as teams are able to get accurate information on a player's measurables – height, weight, arm length, etc. – plus current and detailed medical information, and the player passes a physical, game video from his college career can be used to fill in the blanks. I will say that if a guy expects to be a first-round pick, he better work out for teams at the Combine or a Pro Day and allow himself to be examined by the NFL's medical personnel, or maybe he falls into a later round of the draft. And that can cost him millions of dollars.

Harvin making his mark
Steelers.com
In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today, punter Pressley Harvin shares why Black History Month is important to him and his story of being one of only six Black punters in the history of the NFL.
For punter Pressley Harvin, Black History Month is about learning about those who came before him, understanding the history of the men and women who made strides to make life better for him and others just like him.
"Going back, looking at the history of Black History Month and the things that happened and the things that transpired to have where we are today, sometimes you have to take a step back and look at that history to really learn from it," said Harvin. "I really honor and recognize the month by always trying to find something that's fresh and new education wise. I always wanted to learn more about the Black heritage, Black culture.
"Just being a Black athlete, especially a Black punter, a Black specialist in the NFL, there hasn't been too many of us so just trying to make the road easier for the people behind me is my biggest thing."
And Harvin is spot on. There haven't been many Black punters in the history of the NFL and he is somebody who is opening doors for those who come after him, showing them what they can do.
The only Black punters in the NFL have been Greg Coleman (1977-88), Reggie Roby (1983-98), Rodney Williams (2001), Reggie Hodges (2005-12), Marguette King (2013-18) and Harvin (2021-present).
Harvin is the only active Black punter and getting to where he is today had its challenges.
"I have always been more of an underdog in football," said Harvin, who is making an impact in the community as well through the Steelers Social Justice program. "Whenever I have to prove myself, I have always had that underdog mentality. The biggest underdog factor is I am a Black punter, and you never see that much.
"Whenever I started kicking back in middle school, I always had that mentality that I am different and unique. That continued in high school. I had the mentality that I have to prove to people I can do this at a high level. I took it really personal. I had my ups and downs. Just getting into high school, being on the football team, coaches try to lean you in a direction. That was a direction I didn't agree with. That was the one time I had to tell a coach no, I don't want to do that. Usually, a coach will put you in a right position. That was the first time I told a coach no, I want to do this, not that. He told me flat out I wouldn't be good at it. I thought this coach doesn't believe in what I can do, let me show him I can do this."
It was a frustrating time for Harvin, one that pushed him to the edge, but never over the edge.
"I wanted to quit when I was younger because it wasn't common, I didn't have a coach that was behind me," said Harvin. "It was always my family and God that encouraged me to chase my dreams. Me and my family have a mentality that we don't quit. I kept that I don't quit mentality."
And it all paid off. In 2020, Harvin led the nation and set a Georgia Tech and ACC record with a 49-yard punting average. He was a unanimous first-team All-American, becoming only the third Georgia Tech player to earn that accomplishment, and winning the Ray Guy Award en route.
"It's definitely a huge honor," said Harvin. "It's a lot of hard work and sacrifice. During my career, it hasn't always been pretty. When the punter goes on the field, we aren't always doing well. That is where I try to help out as much as possible.
"I am not the stereotype size and race for a punter, but I do it with my ability. Being the first African American punter to win the Ray Guy Award, it's not just about my name on that trophy, it's about all of the punters who were before me, Greg Coleman, Reggie Roby, guys who paved the way for me to be in the same profession.
"If you have guys who put their heart and mind to something, they can do it."

Steelers help kick off Girls Flag Football season
Steelers.com
The Steelers season is still months away, but there was plenty of football activity at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
As a part of the Steelers continued commitment to growing girls flag football, the team hosted a kickoff event for the Girls Flag Football League in Pittsburgh that they support, with an afternoon filled with excitement that featured tight end Connor Heyward taking part. This year there are 17 schools participating, up from six in 2022, with some of the schools having multiple teams because of the popularity.
The highlight was a unique unveiling of each team's uniforms. The uniforms were hung in the Steelers locker room at Acrisure Stadium, similar to the way Steelers players jerseys are hung on game day, with special lighting making it a one-of-a-kind experience for the players.
"It's pretty awesome," said Mike Marchinsky, the Steelers senior manager of marketing events. "Some of the girls play sports, some don't. But when they walk into their locker rooms at their high school, their unforms aren't hanging like this for the first time. We wanted to provide that experience. It's like what our equipment guys do on game day with the jerseys, hanging them in the lockers on game day when the players get there, or having them on their shoulder pads. We had Nike cleats and gloves in the locker. It's cool to see that experience for the girls for the first time."

The uniforms were provided by Nike as part of a partnership with the NFL and the teams, with a grant given to all 50 states in an effort to grow girls flag football. Schools were able to go to Nike's website and design their own uniforms for free for their teams.
"It's all a part of Nike working with the NFL and NFL Flag to help make girls flag football a sanctioned sport in all 50 states," said Marchinsky.
After changing into their uniforms the players had an opportunity to have a team photo taken in front of the Steelers logo by the player entrance tunnel.
Then it was time to take the field. They held short practices with officials on hand to go over all of the rules and then it was time for scrimmages.
It all wrapped up with a tour of the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum.
"Last year we were able to play the championship tournament at Acrisure Stadium. This year we are unable to host it because of scheduling conflicts," said Marchinsky. "I wanted to make sure the girls had an experience and some excitement from playing the sport, especially the schools that didn't participate last year. We wanted to bring the teams in to experience Acrisure Stadium and have some fun.
"It was a really cool day for the girls, especially the teams that didn't participate last year. They get a feel that this is a Steelers offered program.
"We are so excited to be able to offer this. I am in the business of providing the emotion. I want people to be able to get a sense of encouragement about doing things. It's a different level of excitement when you can do it in the Steelers locker room, at Acrisure Stadium. Everybody in the organization has been awesome to work with on this. Everybody is willing to go above and beyond to make sure the girls have a special experience."

Rookie Recap: Logan Lee
Steelers.com
When Logan Lee suffered a calf injury during the preseason, he never anticipated it would be a quick end to a rookie season that really never got going.
But Lee, the Steelers sixth round pick from Iowa, just knew he would have to be patient, because everything happens for a reason.
Instead of being on the field all season, Lee spent the year on the Reserve/Injured List, learning a different side of how things are in the NFL.
"I have just been extremely blessed with the opportunity to be able to see the way the business works and see that there are a lot of moving parts," said Lee. "I got to see a different point of view in the sense that I obviously wanted to play football. That was my ultimate goal this year. But the Lord had different plans, and ultimately it worked out the best it could have.
"I'm just grateful for the opportunities, my blessing so far, and I'm looking forward to getting to work this offseason.
"The biggest thing for me this season was being out so much, I had a lot of time to take more notes, see things from a different point of view. And me personally, I do learn better when I am doing it physically. But it was a good opportunity for me to learn while not being able to get any walkthrough or physical reps. I think I took a big step there.
"My plan is not always going to be the one that wins out. I think I'm a faithful man and I truly believe the Lord's plan will always be better than my own. Based off of my goals and my intentions, I always set a plan, but I often get reminded that ultimately, I am not in control. I would say that the biggest thing for me this year was it was really hard at the beginning of the year, but I ended up starting to settle down once I understood there is a bigger picture. Everything happens for a reason and I'm just looking forward to that opportunity."
That opportunity almost came about near the end of the 2024 season, when Lee was designated to return from the Reserve/Injured List prior to the regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals and continuing as the team prepared for the Wild Card game against the Ravens. Lee wasn't activated, but just getting the opportunity to be back on the field was a win for him.
"It was very encouraging because the first week, I felt like a fish out of water where I was a step behind everywhere. I was just trying to get reacclimated by drinking water through a fire hose, I guess.
"But it was a really cool opportunity because that second week I felt like I got my feet under me. We had a padded practice, and I felt like it was one of the better practices I had as a Steeler, and I just had four of five months off from practicing. I thought if that's what I'm capable of doing while taking that much time off, I'm super excited to see where it will take me in the near future."
Lee, who was the 178th pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, brought a lot to the table with him when he was selected by the Steelers. He appeared in 43 games at Iowa, starting 41 of them. He had 158 career tackles, including 58 solo stops, 18.5 tackles for a loss, nine sacks and seven passes defensed. Lee started 13 games at defensive tackle in 2023, finishing the season with 55 tackles, 19 of them solo stops. He had five and a half tackles for a loss, three sacks, three pass breakups, one pressure and one blocked kick.
Now, with a year of learning and observing under his belt, he wants to take it to the next level on the field when the team returns in a few months for offseason workouts and ultimately OTAs and minicamp.
"I am preparing myself, preparing my body," said Lee. "I feel like I am in the best shape of my life. I had 18 consecutive weeks of training without playing. So, I felt like I prepared, and I just want to stay on that track and continue to get my body to a place where I am feeling strong, fast and healthy.
"That's the ultimate goal, to stay safe, healthy and prepare as if I am getting ready to play. It's trying to acclimate yourself to the training program we will have when we are getting football like activity going. Just being able to do drills. It's getting acclimated and being in the best shape possible."

Plenty to go around
Steelers.com
They may have saved the best for last in Indianapolis.
The offensive linemen were the final position group to take the field at Lucas Oil Stadium.
If the class pans out as advertised, it will have been worth the wait.
Following is a look at some of the highlights of the NFL Network's coverage of Day Four of the NFL Scouting Combine:
QUALITY AND QUANTITY: NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah called the offensive tackle group "loaded," then elaborated.
"It's ridiculous," he continued. "It's unbelievably stacked and loaded."
Jeremiah has five offensive tackles ranked in his top 20 players available, Notre Dame's Joe Alt (No. 9), Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga (No. 10), Penn State's Olumuyiwa Fashanu (No. 12), Alabama's JC Latham and Washington's Troy Fautanu (No. 17).
Jeremiah also assessed three interior offensive lineman, Oregon's Jackson Powers-Johnson, West Virginia's Zach Frazier and Duke's Graham Barton, as having first-round potential.
NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales relayed she had spoken to a couple of NFL offensive line coaches who were "salivating over these guys."
Jeremiah said one NFL general manager assessed the offensive line group as the best he'd seen in 29 years.
NFL Network commentator Peter Schrager said one NFL GM told him this is "the best offensive line class I can remember since I've been doing this."
That may well be confirmed at the NFL Draft in April.
"The number that I'm hearing, people are expecting roughly eight tackles to go in the first round," Dales reported. "It could be unprecedented, actually."
GUARD APPRECIATION: Offensive tackles tend to get more notoriety but guards make the running game go, NFL Network analyst Shawn O'Hara maintained.
"If you want to run the football in the NFL, you better have some ass-kicking guards," O'Hara insisted. "Those are the guys that really drive the ship when it comes to running the football.
"You get some power at the guard position, that's how you make your hay."
MIGHT AS WELL JUMP: South Dakota State offensive tackle Garrett Greenfield's vertical leap of 381/2" set a record for an offensive lineman at the Combine since 2003.
Greenfield checked in at 6-foot-51/2, 311 pounds.
PRESENCE, PERSONALITY: Schrager said Fuaga's name came up twice from GMs in response to an informal question regarding their favorite interview of Combine week at any position.
"Great personality, all business, a lot of self confidence," Schrager said. "You look at him on the field, he's been dominant in these drills. Fuaga apparently has that leadership trait they're looking for, as well."
BIG-GUY APPROACH: O'Hara unearthed what he claimed to be a warm-up sheet for the offensive linemen in advance of their 40-yard dashes.
It read: "4 Scrambled Eggs, 4 Bacon Strips, 2 Buttered Toast, 1 Venti Coffee #ThinkFastRunFast."
NOT JUST A FAST GUY: NFL Network analyst Charles Davis, like seemingly everyone else, was amazed by Texas wide receiver Xavier Worthy's 40-yard dash on Saturday.
But Davis doesn't consider Worthy's record-setting effort defining.
"Xavier Worthy runs a Combine-record 4.21 40-yard dash, but remember this, he was already known as a good player," Davis insisted. "We've had a number of players who have come here and blown us away with the 40-yard dash who have not made an imprint on the NFL, (Worthy) will."

There is no doubt Steelers fans are passionate about their team, and there is equally no doubt they love to share that passion on their social media accounts.
And there is no better time than the present to do so.
On Sunday, Sept. 1, Steelers Nation will be showing off their black and gold pride unlike any other fan base does.

It's a tradition that first started in Mexico, and Steelers "World Photo Day" has spread around the world. There are already 11 countries and 56 locations committed to participate this year, including the United States, Mexico, Argentina, the U.K., Ireland, Germany, and more.
"World Photo Day has grown into an annual Steelers tradition," said Dan Rooney, Steelers Director of Business Development & Strategy. "Each year, it's exciting to see Steelers Nation put their Black & Gold on full display all around the world. We look forward to seeing it grow even more this year."
This Sunday provides Steelers Nation around the globe the perfect opportunity to put on their black and gold and show their support for the Steelers ahead of the team's season opener against the Atlanta Falcons.
How do you get involved? It's simple and totally up to each fan. You can gather in large groups with friends or family, at a local landmark, in your fan cave, or even with a flag from your country if you would like. Wherever and how you want to show your love for the team works as there is no wrong way.
The key is, take a picture on Sunday, Sept. 1, then share it on social media using the hashtag #SteelersWorldWide.
You can share your photos on the Steelers Fans Foto Official Facebook page or on other forms of social media. Make sure to use the hashtag #SteelersWorldWide.
This Sunday, let's show the world the power of Steelers Nation.

How he fits: MyCole Pruitt
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers signed veteran tight end MyCole Pruitt to a one-year contract.
Pruitt (6-2, 245) is a bit undersized, but he has played as a move tight end/fullback throughout his nine seasons in the NFL.
Initially a fifth-round pick of the Vikings in 2015 out of Southern Illinois, Pruitt showed excellent athleticism at the NFL Scouting Combine, posting a 4.58-second 40-yard dash and 38-inch vertical jump.
Pruitt has spent time with six different NFL teams, but has become a favorite of new Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith.

After playing for the Vikings, Bears and Texans, while also spending some time with the 49ers, Pruitt joined the Titans when Smith was the tight ends coach in 2018.
In 2022, he left Tennessee as a free agent and was signed by the Falcons, where Smith had moved as head coach.
In 109 career games, 39 of them starts, Pruitt has 71 receptions for 748 yards and 12 touchdowns. In his past two seasons with the Falcons, Pruitt caught 25 passes for 260 yards and five touchdowns. Pruitt has been considered an above-average run blocker at the tight end position in his career.

He'll join a crowded tight end room with the Steelers that already includes starter Pat Freiermuth, second-year pro Darnell Washington, a third-round pick in 2023, third-year pro Connor Heyward and Rodney Williams on the Steelers' roster.
All four were on the Steelers' roster for the majority of last season, with Williams holding down a spot as a special teams player.
Smith has liked to use multiple-tight end sets as a coordinator, meaning the Steelers could keep four tight ends again in 2024.
Pruitt played 122 special teams snaps in 2023 for Atlanta, but Heyward and Williams were at 247 and 189, respectively, with Williams getting to that total despite being on the practice squad for the first four games of the season.
Pruitt would be competition for that third or fourth tight end spot, or could serve as insurance in case of an injury at the position prior to the start of the season.
He also gives the Steelers another player, along with recently signed wide receiver Van Jefferson and running back/return man Cordarrelle Patterson, who played for Smith in Atlanta last season.
That could be critical in terms of providing veteran leadership as the team installs a new offense under Smith.

Austin inspired by lessons he has embraced
Steelers.com
February is Black History Month, a time to honor those who have made a difference in our country and broke racial barriers. Steelers.com is highlighting stories from those who were touched by individuals who have broken barriers, to sharing the stories of those who broke barriers themselves.
For many, February is a time to celebrate Black History Month, learn more about those who made a difference paving a way for racial equality.
For Steelers receiver Calvin Austin III, celebrating those individuals isn't something the calendar dictates, as he has seen that history first-hand, growing up in Memphis, Tennessee, the home of the National Civil Rights Museum.
The Museum is the former site of the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. It has been transformed into a tribute to Dr. King and all of the work done by him and many others for the civil rights movement.
And it's a location Austin has been to multiple times.
From a school trip as a kid, to a visit when Memphis played in the Liberty Bowl, to when he was honored at the Black Men Crowned Awards held at the museum in 2021, Austin has walked through the museum time and time again, learning something new every time and taking in everything that Dr. King did to help with the civil rights movement.
"I've been there a lot and each time you focus on something different, or learn something new, or get moved by something you didn't think about," said Austin. "For anyone who wants to go, I would encourage you to go again, because I feel like you really can't capture everything with just one tour or walk around.
"There is so much there, so much history, and so many lessons learned about Dr. King."
Among the items in the museum that give a true depiction of what it was like for those fighting for civil rights is a burnt-out bus that was ridden by 'freedom riders' into the segregated South and were attacked in Alabama and the bus set on fire, as well as tables that depict the restaurant sit-ins fighting segregation.
But nothing is more compelling than the replication of the room where Dr. King was staying when he was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. The room is set up the same as it was that dreadful day in 1968 when Dr. King's life was taken away.
While the rest of the museum creates conversation and questions, this final segment is approached with reverence, silence and deep emotion.
"Going through there, I had the opportunity to get on the bus, sit at the table where they did sit-ins, seeing the hoses and dogs the police used to fight the activists," said Austin. "And then you get to the end, where you walk through and see the room where he stayed, you see the pictures and everything just like it was that day.
"It's surreal, kind of eerie. You feel something inside. He was a man who was trying to make the world a better place and they assassinated him right there. It's kind of a shock to you because you don't know how to feel. You're right there. It's very moving."
While an early school trip might have increased Austin's awareness of Dr. King's legacy, it wasn't the only thing that sparked the young receiver's interest in learning more. He was always captivated by Dr. King's contributions to the civil rights movement, a man who gave so much to simply help others.
"Most importantly is that he rode his own wave and started something," said Austin. "In life in general, a lot of people can be impactful people or have good ideas, but it takes something inside of a person to actually take that leap of faith and put yourself out there and say we can all be one.
"There are people that say certain things about him or against him, but me being a Christian, that's what I'm all about. We're supposed to come together as one under God and love each other. For a Black man at that time to say something, he had some supporters, some doubters and all that, but he still continued, and he walked on.
"It was important to him. He knew that this wasn't just for him. It was for us now. It takes a tremendous sacrifice and just confidence for a person to do something to sacrifice their life. And that is what he did during that time. He put his life on the line not just thinking about himself. It makes you reflect."
During Austin's senior year at Memphis, he was part of a group honored at the museum at the annual Black Men Crowned Awards, which honors Black males in the Memphis area for their leadership and accomplishments in different fields.
Just knowing the history of the museum, being honored there moved Austin.
"That was very impactful for me," said Austin. "Back then I didn't really see myself as somebody in the community that little kids, specifically young Black kids, could look up to. Being there and having kids talk to me, tell me they watched me at Memphis, and other things, it was very impactful. It made me reflect and know you're an example for people. I need to continue to put myself out there because by nature I'm kind of an introvert. But God blessed me with intelligence, and I know there are things I can do, and that encouraged me to continue to do them."
Austin hopes that Dr. King's message, that his legacy, that his battle for all to be treated as one is something that never gets lost on today's youth. He knows how important it is for kids to continue to learn about it, whether it's in the classroom or through an educational and emotional trip to the museum.
"We're supposed to be one and united under God," said Austin. "You don't want to stifle someone's legacy or a memory of them after they sacrificed so much, put their life on the line every day, to not teach the youth and not educate people on what he did. That would be a disservice or dishonor to what he stood for.
"I feel like when you teach a young child his story, it can only inspire them to show their true self. If they have an idea that they have been holding back, they can hear his story and have confidence to show themselves."

Ready to get over the next hurdle
Steelers.com
It's the day every NFL player dreads. The day they have their final team meeting of the season and potentially say goodbye to teammates for the last time.
And in the Steelers locker room at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on Monday afternoon, there wasn't anyone who was excited that this was the end.
Tight end Pat Freiermuth wanted more than anything to still be playing, to be preparing for another game for the joy and love of it, and for Steelers Nation, who he knows want to see them win as bad as they want to win a playoff game themselves.
But instead, they wrapped things up for the year after losing to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round on Saturday night.
Freiermuth feels like they are close, closer than they have been since he was drafted by the Steelers in 2021.
But he knows they need to get over the hump and win a playoff game.
"We've just got to figure out how to get over that next hurdle," said Freiermuth. "(We're) 0-3 in the wild card in my career, so we've just got to figure out a way to get to the divisional, and get to the AFC Championship, and get to the Super Bowl.
"I have the utmost confidence in the organization and guys that are on this roster to get that done."
Freiermuth said that confidence comes from a lot of areas, mainly the people that he is around on a daily basis, the people he works closest with and the way the season went up until the last month.
"We started off the season how we wanted to. We were 10-3 at one point with the game going into Baltimore with the chance to win the division. That's the first time we were able to have that opportunity since I've been here. I feel like we're going in the right direction as an offense and as a team for sure. We've got to figure out how to finish stronger in the last part of the season.
"The young guys that we have, we've got Broderick (Jones), Troy (Fautanu), who obviously missed the year with an injury. We've got guys like Jaylen's obviously going to have a big role. Obviously, GP (George Pickens).
"We've got guys that need to step up, myself included, and we've got to take that leadership role.
"Whatever happens in free agency, or whoever we bring in, we've got to let them know what the standard is and what it means to be a Pittsburgh Steeler. Obviously, we weren't able to get that done this year. Obviously, we try. Our goal is to win a playoff game, and the Super Bowl. But here's no time for laying down. There is a solution every time I'm in this building to figure out a way to get that job done."
That standard is something that was set by Steelers players back in the 1970s and has been there ever since. Freiermuth said it's still there, and they know what the expectation is.
"We understand the standard," said Freiermuth. "We understand the greatness of the past of the Steelers. We're trying to fight every way we can to get back there and obviously, it hasn't been what it has been of recent.
"We're not going to just lay down and not try. Being a Pittsburgh Steeler is playing for the city, playing for Super Bowls and winning football. We've got to get back to that. I understand the fans' frustration and everything like that. We're trying our (butt) off. Everyone is, coaches, the players, we feel it. We wish we could have won some playoff games this year and made the fans and the city proud. But we're going to keep going.
"That's what it means to be the Steelers, never give up. I learned that from Ben (Roethlisberger). You've got to keep going. And so that's really the only solution, is to keep going, keep fighting, keep trying and get back there next year and get into the playoffs and win some games and hopefully get to that goal of winning the Super Bowl."
One thing that might have kept them from that goal this year is a word Freiermuth repeated over and over again as he talked to the group of reporters that were assembled.
"We've got to execute when the games get tough and start off faster," said Freiermuth. "I think that's one of the biggest things going into the offseason, as a guy that's going to be here, is to figure out ways to start faster and execute better in high intensity games.
"As individuals, you look yourselves in the mirror and ask yourselves what you could have done better and as a whole. Figure out how we can be better at that moving forward. Just got to figure it out.
"I think what I'm probably going to say the whole time is just execution. There's been a bunch of clips from watching the film that we just weren't, for whatever reason, executing.
"It's guys figuring out what they can do individually to come in and get better, especially in the offseason. This is a big offseason for a lot of guys on offense. Young guys try to take that next step. Myself trying to take that next step as a complete player, complete tight end. It's a big season for a lot of us.
"We have our goals in mind that obviously everyone knows trying to win a playoff game and try to win the Super Bowl. So, whatever that takes individually, collectively, you've got to do it."

Timing was everything for Brown
Steelers.com
February is Black History Month, a time to honor those who have made a difference in our country and broke racial barriers. Steelers.com is highlighting stories from those who were touched by individuals who have broken barriers, to sharing the stories of those who broke barriers themselves.
Sometimes, timing can be everything.
And for Larry Brown, the former Steelers tight end/tackle who is a member of the team's Hall of Honor, that was certainly the case.
Brown grew up during a time when segregation was the rule and not the exception in the South. It came with Brown, an African American, not able to enjoy the same things white people in his area did. He couldn't eat at the same restaurants, use the same door to go to the doctor's office, use the same restrooms or go to the same school as the white kids in his hometown of Starke, Florida.
And that was just the tip of the iceberg.
Until things changed in 1964.
On July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation in businesses, it banned discriminatory practices in employment and ended segregation in places such as public schools.
That ruling changed Brown's life for good.
There were two high schools in Brown's hometown, one had a football team, one didn't.
In Brown's junior year of high school in 1965, while attending school that didn't offer football, he realized the high school football powerhouse in his area, Bradford High School, was now desegregated.
His mind thought about transferring there, but he wasn't quite ready at that time to make the move to the new school.
When the spring of 1966 rolled around, Brown joined the team for spring practice. They were coming off the 1965 state championship, and for a young man that had a love for football growing in his heart, it was an opportunity he never could have envisioned.
So, he jumped at it.
"During that time, we lived in the deep South, we lived in Florida, in a small town, a rural town and everything was segregated," said Brown. "Everything was that way, restaurants, schools, just the way of life was segregated. Going into the doctor's office, there was what they called a colored entrance. It was a way of life down there.
"Luckily for me in that regard, desegregation happened the year prior to me going to Bradford because I thought about it for a minute. I didn't go over there in my junior year. I waited and went my senior year.
"I was always a fan of football, watching games on television. They won the state championship at Bradford my junior year. I remember following them on the radio. I thought, maybe I would give it a try.
"I played a lot of football for fun, touch football, in gym class and on the street. I thought I would like to try going out for a team. So, I went over that spring before my senior year. They had spring training practice going on. I went over and met the coach. I went with one other student, and we had a chance to do their spring training. I'd walk over to the other place after school and it was probably a mile and a half, two miles, that separated the schools. So, after school, I'd walk over and go to spring practice. I actually got a chance to participate in the spring game.
"As the school year ended, and summer football started, I transferred schools, and I played there. I got to do training leading into the school year. But the other student, for some reason I never really found out, chose not to come back out."
While Brown wasn't sure what to expect in his first season, thanks to legendary coach David Hurse, he never had an issue fitting in.
"I can tell you, he was just one of the best coaches I've ever been around," said Brown. "He was interested in coaching, teaching. It was an opportunity for him. He saw me as someone who had some potential to play. I do recall I got injured during the spring session before I registered at the school. It was a leg injury. I think I got cleated in the calf. I didn't go back to practice because it was kind of difficult to walk. I got called to the office at the school I was at, and Coach Hurse was there.
"He said, what happened? I told him and he said well you still have to come to practice with us. He expressed what appeared to me a real sincere interest in me, just making sure I didn't quit. And he really wanted me on the team. That went a long way with me.
"I think because of his leadership, I never had any issues with my teammates at all. At some point, you're strangers to each other. The way to really get to know each other is through blood, sweat and tears and bumping into each other and gaining respect for what the other guy is doing. Our team wasn't very big. We only had 21-22 guys on the team. We depended on each other. We got to know each other on a raw basis during the spring. I made the team that year and we actually went on to win a state championship a second time, even after a lot of the players had graduated. I held one of the spots on offense and one of the spots on defense. We were fortunate enough to win a championship.
"I'm still friends with guys that are on that team. That afforded me a great opportunity. It was a great experience for me. We've had some reunions, and one of the things they asked, because they remembered different incidents or things that would happen when we traveled. And quite frankly, I didn't recall the ones they were remembering because I grew up there and whatever someone said, I didn't really hear it.
"I really value and treasure that opportunity because it makes me think of all the players and kids that I grew up with who were ahead of me in school, who I thought were just outstanding athletes and didn't get that opportunity, didn't get that chance. It wasn't lost on me how fortunate I was with the timing.
"The timing was right for me. It was quite a blessing."
Thanks to his time at Bradford High School, Brown was able to earn a scholarship to the University of Kansas. And ultimately the Steelers drafted him in the fifth round of the 1971 NFL Draft, landing him at a place that was an ideal situation.
"When I got here, you could just tell the makeup of the club, the way people were treated, the community aspect of the team itself and the coaching," said Brown. "It was the perfect place for me. I got a chance to play on what arguably was one of the best teams that was ever assembled with all the players. There were a lot of players who didn't necessarily get some of the hype, but also very good players throughout the roster. The Rooneys and Coach (Chuck) Noll had a philosophy that was focused on the best players available. You felt like you were getting a fair shot. That's the way it was the whole time. You had to work to get your opportunity. And the Rooney family was a part of that."
Brown always looks at the NFL's Rooney Rule, which requires teams interview diverse candidates for key positions, including coaches and management, to help increase the number of minorities in key positions, as something that tells the story of what the Steelers and Rooney family mean to the game.
"When I was a player, there were times when I'd go get my hair cut in the Hill District area of Pittsburgh and a lot of the old guys there, they just loved Mr. (Art) Rooney (Sr.)," said Brown. "They talked about him. They talked about the stories he shared. He just treated everybody the same. I remember I spent time in the hospital and the lady who was cleaning up the room came in and she just talked about Mr. Rooney. He was a neighbor, who happened to own the Steelers.
"That culture permeated the organization through their leadership. Dan Rooney, he grew up in that culture with his dad. I think they led the way in that regard. And the spirit of the Rooney Rule is something that was saying just as we built our team here, based on the player available with no regard for anything other than giving the best people the opportunity regardless of anything. If you don't give everyone a chance, you're denying the league the best coaches and so forth."
Brown, who currently owns and operates Applebees restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, dealt with a lot in his early years during segregation, but when it ended, he was able to see there were good people out there who were victims of the way the world was, just like he was.
"It should never have been the case," said Brown of segregation. "The situation should never have existed. There never should have been that kind of situation in terms of the history of the country, or the history of that community I grew up in. In that regard, I do feel fortunate. It's not lost on me the opportunity I was given.
"A lot of things that were going on, I was accustomed to. I remember at one of the high school reunions, some guys were almost apologetic for what I went through. They were as much a victim of the culture as I was. They grew up in a culture that existed. They were doing what the norm was, as I was.
"The amazing thing about getting to know people is it's an opportunity for things to change. A lot of what you thought and what the culture was in terms of who was who, it just kind of got dispelled. People I thought of one way, we could have been friends from the time we were little kids if things were different."

Skill position players make a big statement
Offensive skill position players grabbed the spotlight Saturday at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.
And what has been considered a loaded running back class didn't disappoint at Lucas Oil Stadium, posting an average 40-time of 4.48 seconds, the fastest recorded by that position group since the NFL Network has been broadcasting the event starting in 2003.
"This group is delivering right now. It's an impressive group," said NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah. "This has been an awesome group. It's lived up to the buildup."
Virginia Tech's Bhayshel Tuten paced the group with an official time of 4.32 seconds in the 40-yard dash. He also recorded a 40.5-inch vertical jump to go along with a 10-foot, 10-inch broad jump.
But it was the 40 times that had everyone buzzing.
"We didn't have any outliers," Jeremiah said. "Everybody was just running in the 4.4s, one after another. Usually, you'll get a 4.8 thrown in there and we didn't have that."
"The running backs stole the show."
Those times came without some of the draft's best running backs – Boise State's Ashton Jenty, Tennessee's Dylan Sampson and Cam Skattebo of Arizona State – taking part in the 40.
Jenty, considered the top running back in this draft, while Sampson and Skattebo participated in some testing and drills but did not run because of injuries. They'll do so at their respective pro days.
"As a runner, I've never seen someone who wants and seeks out contact as much as he does," Jeremiah said of Skattebo. "I know he's not as tall as (former Steelers 2017 draft pick) James Conner, but he reminds me of James Conner coming out of Pitt."
While Tuten ran his extremely fast 40 at 206 pounds, perhaps even more impressive were the efforts of Ohio State's Quinshon Judkins and Omarion Hampton of North Carolina.
Both weighed 221 pounds.
Judkins posted a 40-time of 4.48 seconds, while Hampton was slightly better at 4.46 seconds.
"Judkins is thirsty for contact. He seeks it out," Jeremiah said. "Judkins is a finisher. Penn State game, last four minutes, he put that one in the refrigerator."
Judkins also posted a 38.5-inch vertical jump and an 11-foot broad jump that was the best of any running back at this combine.
Hampton, meanwhile, was at 38 inches in the vertical jump and 10-feet, 10-inches in the broad jump.
"That's impressive at 221 pounds. He is big and he is explosive," said Jeremiah, comparing him to New York Jets running back Breece Hall. "I don't think he gets into the second round where Breece Hall went. I would be shocked if he gets into the second round."
All told, 14 running backs posted official times in the 40-yard dash under 4.5 seconds.
Straight-line speed isn't everything when it comes to running the ball. Other things such as vision and balance also factor into the equation.
But this draft looks to be loaded at the position.
"It's going to be interesting to see if there's a game of chicken that's going to be played," Jeremiah said of what will happen in the draft. "I think you're going to see starters in the fourth and fifth rounds. Day 2 is the sweet spot."
QBs step up: A number of quarterbacks did not run or throw at the combine and won't until their pro days – either because of personal choice or injury.
Among those were Cam Ward of Miami (Fla.) and Shedeur Sanders of Colorado, considered by many to be the top two quarterbacks in this draft.
Only two quarterbacks – Brady Cook of Missouri and Seth Henigan of Memphis – actually chose to run 40s in the first group. Louisville's Tanner Shough was the only QB to run in the late session.
But Mississippi's Jaxson Dart, Ohio State's Will Howard, Dillon Gabriel of Oregon, Alabama's Jalen Milroe and Shough were among those who competed in the throwing drills Saturday.
All are considered potential starters down the road in the NFL.
"I think there's a good clump of those guys," Jeremiah said. "Jaxson Dart is in that mix. Will Howard is in that mix. Tanner Shough is in that mix. And I think Dillon Gabriel could be a guy in the right system to be that guy."
Jeremiah currently has Dart as his third quarterback in this year's draft class.
"With Jaxson Dart, the comparison I had the other day that took people off guard was Jalen Hurts, just in terms of the build, how the ball comes out of their hand, guys that have just gotten better every year," Jeremiah said. "Jaxson Dart was successful running the ball in the SEC. He's very athletic."
Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner described the group as good but not great.
"I see a lot of really good quarterbacks, productive quarterbacks. But I don't know if we have the 'Wow!' players in this group," Warner said. "Which was the better thrower of this group? That's what I like about this competition. … I want to see, do they put the right pace on all of the different throws?"
Shough, at nearly 6-foot-5 and 219 pounds, showed off his athleticism, running a 4.64 40-yard dash.
"He is big and he has a strong arm," Jeremiah said of Shough. "Watch him and you'll see some strong throws. He can really, really let it rip."
No record breaker: Friday, Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond said he would break the combine record 40-yard dash of former teammate Xavier Worthy set in 2024.
Worthy ran a 4.21-second 40-yard dash at Indianapolis last year.
"I'm going to break the record, for sure," Bond said Friday. "I anticipate running 4.20 or possibly, if I'm feeling great, I might run 4.1."
His confidence didn't match the reality, as Bond was timed at 4.39 seconds in the 40.
In fact, he wasn't even the fastest Texas receiver at the combine. Teammate Matthew Golden ran an official 4.29-second 40-yard dash T 5-11 ⅛ and 191 pounds running in the same early group of wide receivers.
Golden is considered a potential first-round prospect and Jeremiah compared him to former Steelers WR Santonio Holmes.
"He's one of my favorites to watch for a number of reasons," Jeremiah said. "He's just really crisp. He just snaps everything off."
Golden's time was the second-fastest for a wide receiver weighing at least 190 pounds since 2003.
Tennessee's Donte Thornton Jr. nearly matched him at 6-4 ½ and 205 pounds, but was officially timed at 4.30 seconds.
Overall, it was one of the fastest groups of wide receivers in combine history, as 10 players posted times of sub-4.40 seconds, the most since the NFL Network began tracking it in 2003.
Faulkner runs the drill: Steelers running backs coach Eddie Faulkner is known for incorporating a lot of drill work with his position at practices.
Saturday, he ran the running backs group through a drill named after former Steelers running back Duce Staley, getting an up-close look at this group.
The drill is a footwork drill combined with a vision approach, as runners go forward, backward and side to side stepping over pads on the field. They then explode toward three big bags held by coaches who lean the pads one way or another to simulate a block.
The runners must then read the block correctly and cut off of that.
Lean and mean: Plenty of players drop weight for the combine but Iowa running back Caleb Johnson drew raves from Jeremiah for dropping down to 224 pounds.
Johnson played as high as 240 pounds for the Hawkeyes.
He posted a 4.57-second 40-yard dash and looked smooth in the drills.
"He is lean, for somebody who is 224 pounds," Jeremiah said. "He's carried 240 pounds on that frame. Find the right fit, get somewhere where they're going to let you run outside zone, one cut and go."
Heavy hitters: Many players decide to trim down for the Combine in an effort to run faster.
For others, who might have questions about what kind of weight they can hold – or if they're too small – try to put on some weight.
Ohio State quarterback Will Howard was the largest of the players in Indianapolis at that position, carrying 236 pounds on his 6-foot-4 ¼-inch frame.
Dylan Gabriel of Oregon was the smallest QB at 5-foot-11 ⅛ and 205 pounds.
At running back, Clemson's Phil Mafeh weighed 234 pounds at 6-0 ⅝. The lightest running back was Delaware's Marcus Yarns at 5-10 ⅞ and 193 pounds.
At wide receiver, Oregon's Tez Johnson weighed in at a very light 154 pounds, making him the lightest player at the Combine at any position.
Sitting this one out: Indiana quarterback Kurtis Rourke would have loved to have worked out at the Combine this week to perhaps improve his draft stock after leading the Hoosiers to the College Football Playoffs this season.
But it was revealed following the season that Rourke had torn his ACL over the summer and played through it. He also suffered a broken thumb during the season, but didn't miss a start.
Nobody is questioning Rourke's toughness.
"Back in July, I kind of tweaked it a little bit. I got an MRI. It was just partially torn," Rourke said of his ACL j,hnbmhinjury. "They said I might have some nagging discomfort throughout the season until I could rest after the season. So that's kind of what I went on. I had some instability issues, but I just wanted to play through it. I just wanted to make sure I could be available for every game. And it wasn't until after the season that I realized at some point from July to the end of the season that it fully tore. And so I was just happy that I was able to play through it."
As for the thumb issue, once he determined it wouldn't affect his ability to play, there was no doubt he was going to continue to do so.
"I was healthy enough to play, and that's all that mattered to me," Rourke said. "I wanted to make sure I gave it everything I had this year, especially being my last year. And if I was feeling great, I was going to play, no matter what was going on. So thanks to the whole training staff for helping me get through all my injuries. Yeah, I'm just happy after the season."
A transfer from Ohio, Rourke completed 69.4 percent of his passes for over 3,000 yards with 29 touchdown passes and 4 interceptions while leading Indiana to an 11-2 record. He said doctors have told him he could be ready to return to the field by training camp.
But he wouldn't trade an intact ACL for what he experienced last season.
"Just being able to go through the season with a new team, a new scheme, and just go play - it was an awesome experience," Rourke said. "That's the reason I transferred. I wanted to get that opportunity to play against the best competition and show that I belonged. Being able to do that with the team that we had was really special."

Uncovering gems: Entering the Senior Bowl, North Dakota State offensive lineman Grey Zabel was considered a mid-round prospect with position flexibility.
Coming out of a strong week of practices at the Senior Bowl, Zabel's name is one that has been rising among draft prognosticators.
"I've heard that a lot throughout this process. But going down to the Senior Bowl and competing well against top talent just goes to show that football is football," Zabel told reporters Saturday. "Everyone puts on the shoulder pads the same way. Everyone bleeds red. If you're a good football player, teams are going to find you, no matter where you played."

Triple Take: Ranking the top TEs in the draft
The Triple Take crew of Dale Lolley, Matt Williamson and Mike Prisuta take a look at the top prospects in the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft, which will be held in April. Today, they delve into the tight end position.
The opinions expressed here are their own and not those of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Dale's Take
The tight end class in the 2025 NFL Draft looks like a good one. And that makes sense as more offensive coordinators at the NFL and collegiate levels see tight ends as the matchup issue that they can be.
Last year, we saw Brock Bowers reset the record books for the position as a rookie, catching 112 passes for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns. And given the Raiders' success in utilizing Bowers as a rookie chess piece, expect other teams to try to accomplish that same thing with both Tyler Warren of Penn State and Coleston Loveland of Michigan, two tight ends expected to be first-round selections in this year's draft.
But the draft is deep with talented players beyond those two, giving tight end-needy teams further options in later rounds.
Dale's Rankings
1.Tyler Warren, Penn State, 6-5 ½, 256 lbs. - Big and athletic, Warren caught 104 passes for over 1,200 yards in Penn State's offense last season. He also lined up as a Wildcat quarterback, ran the ball and did everything you might expect a former high school quarterback to do. He was the straw that stirred the drink. He's also a capable blocker.
2. Colston Loveland, Michigan, 6-5 ¾, 248 lbs. - Loveland had a better season in 2023 during Michigan's national championship run, but that was largely due to Michigan's issues at quarterback in 2024. He's a talented player and good all-around tight end who has been on the NFL radar since his freshman season. He is extremely athletic as a pass catcher and should continue to develop as a blocker as his frame fills out.
3. Mason Taylor, LSU, 6-5 ⅛, 251 lbs. - The son of Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive end and Pittsburgh native Jason Taylor, Mason Taylor is a plus athlete at the position who understands how to get open and uses his big frame to shield off defenders. He'll need to continue to grow as a blocker, but will give a team a valuable receiving chip until that happens.
4. Elijah Arroyo, Miami (Fla.), 6-5 ⅛, 250 lbs. - Arroyo had two seasons cut short by injury in college, but took off in 2024 with Cam Ward at QB. With 33-inch arms, he plays bigger than he is and is a seam stretcher. He averaged nearly 17 yards per catch with seven TDs in 2024 and followed that up with a solid performance at the Senior Bowl practices. Medical checks will be big for Arroyo.
5. Mitchell Evans, Notre Dame, 6-5 ⅜, 258 lbs. - Evans has prototypical size and is a solid blocker who offers good ability in the passing game for teams looking for a combination tight end. Evans might not ever be a star at the position, but he could be a long-time starter in a league starved for tight ends who can block – he's a plus blocker in the run game – and also catch the ball effectively.
Sleeper - Jackson Hawes, Georgia Tech, 6-4 ½, 253 lbs. - A nasty blocker, Hawes transferred from Yale to Georgia Tech and did miss a beat showing he could compete at a higher level. Hawes wasn't used much as a pass catcher at Georgia Tech, bringing in 16 passes for 195 yards, but he's capable there. Tight ends with his brand of nasty in the run game tend to hang around a long time in the NFL.
Matt's Take
It is pretty widely known that the running back and defensive line classes this year are extremely strong and headline the 2025 NFL Draft. But the tight end position isn't far behind. This is a very strong group that should feature two first-round picks and very good depth throughout all seven rounds.
In a draft class that isn't particularly rich with first-round quarterbacks and offensive tackles, it will be very interesting to see when the first tight end comes off the board. Penn State's Tyler Warren and Michigan's Colston Loveland could both hear their names called in the top 20 picks. And it wouldn't be a huge surprise to see as many as 20 tight ends drafted overall.
Lastly, if you look at the teams that have advanced the farthest in the playoffs the past few years, you also see a direct correlation to the best tight ends in the league. Kansas City epitomizes this with Travis Kelce, but top tight ends George Kittle, Mark Andrews, Sam LaPorta, and Dallas Goedert have certainly also helped their respective teams win a lot of playoff games of late.
Matt's Rankings * 1. Tyler Warren, Penn State, 6-5 1/2, 256 lbs. - * Warren is a weapon and Penn State treated him as such, getting the ball into his hands in any way possible. A high school quarterback with a very high football IQ, Warren is consistently a friendly target to his quarterback and provides a lot after the catch. Warren is highly competitive, difficult to get on the ground and demonstrates very light and nimble feet for a big man.
2. Colston Loveland, Michigan, 6-5 3/4, 248 lbs. - Loveland is much more receiver than blocker. But he is a mismatch in the passing game. After helping Michigan win the National Championship in 2023, Loveland's final season was injury-marred and not as productive. He still led the Wolverines in receiving in nine of his 10 games in 2024, nonetheless. Loveland is an excellent mover than can align anywhere within the formation and attack all levels of the field.
3. Mason Taylor, LSU, 6-5 1/8, 251 lbs. - The great Jason Taylor's son, Mason is a natural. He is a very effortless and balanced athlete that does everything well on the football field. Taylor isn't a devastating blocker, but usually gets the job done in the run game. But as a receiver, Taylor really shines with crisp yet fluid routes and a great ability to pluck the football away from his big frame.
4. Elijah Arroyo, Miami, 6-5 1/8, 250 lbs. - Arroyo is an athlete that can really run and stretch the seam. He accelerates quickly and can run past linebackers. But Arroyo isn't just a straight-line athlete. He gets in and out of his breaks very well and with crispness. Arroyo isn't much of a blocker and will need to improve his overall physicality, but he should also be an instant headache for NFL defensive coordinators.
5. Terrence Ferguson, Oregon, 6-5 3/8, 247 lbs. - Ferguson really stood out at the Combine, but his blocking skills are a little underwhelming. Still, there is a lot to work with here as a potential every down player at the next level. Ferguson finished his college career as the Ducks all-time leader in receptions (134) and touchdown receptions (16) by a tight end. He has good ball skills and body control but hasn't been used deep downfield all that much.
Sleeper: Luke Lachey, Iowa, 6-5 3/4, 251 lbs. - An Iowa tight end? That speaks for itself! Lachey is the son of great NFL offensive tackle Jim Lachey and while Luke might not be quite the blocker that his father was, Lachey is one of the best blockers in this entire class - and he loves it. Lachey has great size and tested very well in Indianapolis but did not run the 40-yard dash. He isn't a dynamic receiving threat, but Iowa's run-first offense didn't help Lachey's stat line and he does consistently show soft hands combined with a great catching radius. Lachey is a two-time captain at Iowa and will be another year removed from a serious 2023 season ending leg injury that might have hampered him last season.
Mike's Take
When the New England Patriots reeled off a run of four Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl victories in a span of five seasons from 2014-18, they did so thanks in large part to the blocking, pass-catching and earth-shattering spikes of tight end Rob Gronkowski.
"Gronk" also won a championship with his old QB, fellow ex-Patriot Tom Brady, in 2020 in Tampa.
And when the Kansas City Chiefs made it to five Super Bowls in six seasons, including the last three in succession, and wound up on the right side of the confetti three times from 2019 through last season, tight end Travis Kelce was often the player quarterback Patrick Mahomes looked to when a play had to be made.
Anyone else sensing a trend?
A great tight end can be worth his weight in Lombardi trophies.
It remains to be seen if the next Gronkowski or Kelce is available for selection in the upcoming NFL Draft.
But if he's out there somewhere, you can't draft that guy too high.
Mike's Rankings
1. Tyler Warren, Penn State (6-51/2, 256 lbs.) - The John Mackey Award winner in 2024 can beat you in whatever capacity is required. Warren caught 104 passes for 1,233 yards and eight touchdowns and carried 26 times for 218 yards and four scores last season. He even threw six passes and completed three for 35 yards and a touchdown. Warren's "Wildcat QB" versatility is the icing on the cake. NFL comparisons that have been thrown around include Brock Bowers and Tyler Eifert.
2. Mason Taylor, LSU ( 6-5 1/8, 251 lbs. ) - Bloodlines help separate Taylor, who is the son of Hall-of-Famer Jason Taylor and a nephew of Hall-of-Famer Zach Thomas. When it comes to performance and approach, Mason Taylor gets it. "Everything he does he just does in a professional manner," NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah assessed. Added Jason Taylor regarding his son: "He's not about all the nonsense, he's just about ball." Mason Taylor's performance at the Senior Bowl justified the great expectations.
3. Harold Fannin Jr., Bowling Green (6-31/8, 238 lbs.) - Fannin set FBS single-season records for receptions (117) and receiving yards (1,555) by a tight end in 2024, along with 10 receiving touchdowns, on the way to earning First-Team AP All-America honors. And it wasn't all dominance against Old Dominion. Fannin's monster campaign included 11 catches, 137 receiving yards and a touchdown against Penn State and similar productivity (8-145-1) against Texas A&M.
2. Colston Loveland, Michigan, 6-5 3/4, 248 lbs. - Loveland was Michigan's second-leading receiver in 2023 (with 649 yards, behind Roman Wilson's 789) and No. 1 among Wolverines in 2024 with 56 catches, 582 receiving yards and five touchdown receptions. He's reliable in clutch situations and physical after the catch. And he plays with a swagger that borders on arrogance.
5. Elijah Arroyo, Miami (6-41/2, 251 lbs.) - NFL comparisons have been made to Detroit's Sam LaPorta. Arroyo can stretch the field, he embraces blocking responsibilities and he was one of the standout performers during Senior Bowl Week. He's a player on the rise after accounting for seven of his eight career touchdown receptions in 2024.
Sleeper: Jackson Hawes, Georgia Tech (6-41/8, 252) - Hawes' career statistics (51-566-6) pale in comparison to what more prolific pass-catching prospects amass in a single season. But former Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy considered Hawes the best of the bunch in Mobile, Ala. this year when it comes to in-line blocking. Hawes spent his first three collegiate seasons at Yale and showed he's passing-game capable if need be at the Senior Bowl.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Jan. 23
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
STEFAN PISOCKI FROM WILMINGTON, DE: I don't see what happens on the practice field, but I do see how players deal with the press. Russell Wilson has the reputation for saying the right things to the media, and I noticed Justin Fields doing the same after being replaced by Wilson. Instead of saying something inflammatory a la Kenny Pickett ("I learned nothing sitting on the bench"), Fields said something to the effect of had he played well enough, he would still be starting. I thought that was perfect, and there was very little talk of a quarterback controversy. Do we owe Russell for this? ANSWER: A player can lead by example, but the other players have to want to be led. In the specific situation you cite, I would credit Justin Fields for being a team player who showed professionalism and perspective for the way he handled that.
JASON GODFREY FROM ENOREE, SC: Thanks to all of you who keep us informed and entertained on Steelers.com. My question is about the coin toss. Does it really make a difference when a team defers to the second half? I remember in my limited playing days you selected kick or receive. With every team that defers basically receiving in the second half, what's the real difference? ANSWER: The difference is this: The way the coin toss works is that the team winning it gets to choose its option to open the game, and then at the start of the second half the other team gets to choose its option. It's not an automatic that the team that receives to start the game then gets to receive to start the second half. Before deferring became an option, the choices after winning the coin toss were to receive, kick-off, or defend a goal. Then in the second half, the team that didn't win the coin toss got to choose from those same three options. That's why the team that won the coin toss always elected to receive, because if it elected to kick-off the other team would get to pick first to start the second half and could choose to receive and end up getting the ball to start both halves of the game. Now that the option to defer exists, the team that wins the toss is allowed to defer its choice to receive, kick-off, or defend a goal until the start of the second half. There is a clear difference between choosing to defer after winning the coin toss and electing to kick-off after winning the coin toss.
GARY HOPKINS FROM CINCINNATI, OH: So, I just read that the Ravens are likely to cut Mark Andrews loose. Should we take a run at him? ANSWER: My initial impression of any "reports" the Ravens "are likely to cut" Mark Andrews after the playoff loss to the Bills in Buffalo are typical overreactions to the end of a season many believed was destined to end with a Super Bowl victory. In my opinion, cutting Andrews for dropping that pass for a game-tying 2-point conversion makes as much sense as firing Coach John Harbaugh for creating that situation by needlessly going for 2 late in the third quarter instead of just kicking the PAT to cut Buffalo's lead to 21-20. Kick that PAT late in the third quarter, and then all the Ravens would've needed was another PAT to tie the game with 93 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.
CORY OMASTA FROM CORAOPOLIS, PA: I am still a believer that having a physical running attack complemented by downfield passing is a recipe to win a lot of games in January and February (look at the Eagles and Ravens). However, in watching those teams, it seems the way they go about getting production in the run game through motion, unique formations, and disguising of plays was far superior to the Steelers offense of this year. Given our spotty offensive line play, was this intentional so the plays we did run were executed at a high level? ANSWER: I think you kind of answered your own question. Because in my opinion, the success of the Eagles and Ravens in running the football has much less to do with "motion, unique formations, and disguising of plays" and more to do with the ability of their offensive linemen to win the battles waged along the line of scrimmage.
JUSTIN WHEATLEY FROM DAYTON, OH: Is there a possible chance that the Steelers are going to re-sign Najee Harris? ANSWER: Anything is possible, but I believe the most likely outcome is that Najee Harris accepts an offer from another team after becoming an unrestricted free agent for a chance at a fresh start somewhere else.
RUSS PALLONE FROM TRINIDAD, CO: Can you explain a reserve/futures contract? ANSWER: At the end of a season, players on a team's 53-man roster usually remain there until the start of the new league year, which in 2025 is on March 12, even though some players on 53-man rosters are released for salary cap purposes. Players on a practice squad or without any team affiliation are able to sign with any team for the following season, and those contracts are called reserve/futures contracts because those contracts do not count on the salary cap and those players do not count as part of the 90-man offseason roster until the start of the new league year. Teams are able to sign as many players to reserve/futures contracts as they want, but come the start of the new league year teams must be under the salary cap and cannot have a roster that exceeds 90 players. There is no limit to the amount of money a player can be paid under the terms of a reserve/futures contract, but typically those contracts are for the league minimum based on the individual's years of service in the league. As a general rule, high-profile players do not sign reserve/futures contracts, because it's in their best interest to go into free agency and expose themselves to the open market, and it's also rare for a high-profile player not to be on any team's 53-man roster at the end of a season.
CLINT REED FROM WICHITA, KS: If you could select 4 Pittsburgh Steelers past or present, who would be on your Steelers version of Mount Rushmore? ANSWER: In my opinion, I have beaten this Mount Rushmore business to death, but I'll play along one more time for the last time. Art Rooney Sr. Dan Rooney. Chuck Noll, Joe Greene. Those are my 4.
BOB WALKER FROM BRENTWOOD, TN: Van Jefferson played at our local high school here in Tennessee. What's his contract status? ANSWER: Van Jefferson is due to become an unrestricted free agent at 4 p.m. EST on March 12.
CARL HASSENPLUG FROM NILES, OH: What do you think about hiring Jeff Saturday as offensive line coach? ANSWER: I don't think Jeff Saturday views his future as a coach as much as he does as a media personality. Remember, after he retired, while Saturday did some coaching at the high school level the direction of his career was as an ESPN personality covering the NFL. While at ESPN, Colts Owner Jim Irsay hired Saturday as an interim coach after Frank Reich was fired in what was a surprise move. Saturday went 1-7 as the Colts interim coach, and then he went back to ESPN and has had his role with the network expand. And Pat Meyer is currently the Steelers offensive line coach.

Wilson-Batch sets the standard
Steelers.com
If you are looking for a definition of what it means to be a Women of Steel in Pittsburgh, there are a lot of amazing adjectives that could be tossed out for the ladies who represent Steelers Nation.
Hard-working, dedicated, devoted, passionate, business-minded, philanthropic, intelligent, kind and the list could go on and on.
But it might be easier to just keep it simple and limit it to just a few words.
Latasha Wilson-Batch.
Wilson-Batch, the wife of former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch, epitomizes what the Steelers Women of Steel program is all about, bringing all of those qualities and so many more to the table with the work she does as the Executive Director of the Best of the Batch Foundation and beyond.
To introduce you to her, Wilson-Batch earned her undergraduate degree from Johnson C. Smith University, which included a BS in psychology and a BA in physical education with a concentration in sports management. She earned her Master of Science in human development and sports from the University of Tennessee and a second master's degree from Carlow University in counseling psychology.
Batch's resume is an impressive one, highlighted by being an adjunct professor at Duquesne University in the School of Business for six years. She teaches sports marketing and promotion and strategic business and sports, a capstone course.
"What I love about teaching these courses is there are so many different opportunities for the students," said Wilson-Batch. "I love engaging with different levels of young adults. I don't know everything. They teach me like I teach them. That's always the exciting part about certain things.
"There are so many different ways to make a career in sports. Like I always tell them, if you love socks, every athlete wear socks. There are different ways you could create a brand. You could create different techniques. You could create socks that stop you from sweating, any kind of sock. If you are passionate about it and stick with it, there's always something there.
"I always say there's something for everybody because a lot of times when you go into the sports industry, the first thing they put you in is ticket sales to get people in seats. I always say that isn't the beginning and the end. There are opportunities in everything that you love and you can make it into a passion within the field of sports.
"I told somebody this past semester was the best class I ever had, and I know you are never supposed to say that. But one of the things we do is have a debate topic and convince people of your point of view. It's supposed to be a seven-minute presentation the students give. But this class fell in love with it, to the point where the presentations turned into 22 minutes, 28 minutes because they got into it about their purpose, their stance on certain things in sports. For me it was amazing and touching because I already had every one of these students in my previous class. So, to watch them develop within a year, a year and a half time and to see the thought process and how they're thinking outside the box, it gave me hope for the future. These students were ones who were the pandemic graduating class in high school. It gave me hope that there is still a spark there. Things are still coming back. The creative thinking, the thought processes stuff is there. That actually gave me the additional drive and I'm already looking forward to the fall semester for my new group of kiddos I'll be having in my class."
Wilson-Batch proudly serves on multiple boards and is an active member with numerous organizations. She is on the Advisory Council for Robert Morris Sports Management, Advisory Council for the University of Pittsburgh Brain Institute, a Trustee at Carlow, a member of Leadership Pittsburgh, Family Advisor for the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University, Executive Committee for Off The Field Players Wives Association, and Ladies Council Liaison for the NFLPA.
Oh, and just because it's worth sharing, in her free time, she makes the best mac and cheese you have ever tasted.
While she is passionate about all of the above and pours her heart and soul into everything she does, there is nothing that touches her the way her role as Executive Director of the Best of the Batch Foundation does, a role she has embraced since 2002.
The Best of the Batch Foundation was founded in 1999, fulfilling a promise Charlie Batch made after his younger sister, Danyl Settles, was shot and killed in 1996, in the crossfire between rival gangs in their Homestead neighborhood. Through the Best of the Batch Foundation, they have established themselves as true difference makers, people the community and region can depend on, to be there for the youth in particular to help give them a better future. The foundation has been serving the area now for 25 years and has been built into a force to serve others by the two.
The Foundation was originally housed in a 5,300 square foot building in the Homestead area. Earlier this year, they opened a new 'Clubhouse,' a building that was originally planned for 21,000 square feet, but through additional development is now a state-of-the-art educational facility that is 33,000 square feet. The foundation's mission is to provide children in grades K-12 in Western Pennsylvania free programs focused on education, health and wellness, outreach services and more, with the majority of the activities taking place in the 'Clubhouse,' a welcoming, safe place where kids can hang out with their friends and learn at the same time.
"Latasha did a great job steering the course and making sure that everything aligned to where everything needed to be," said Charlie Batch when the 'Clubhouse' opened. "She deserves more credit than I do with this particular project because she stayed on it. She was making sure whatever detail that needed to be handled, she was on it."
That she did. Much of the construction of the new headquarters took place during the pandemic, causing delays and issues they never could have imagined. But she kept things moving forward and always kept the focus on the kids they serve.
"When I first started, I never thought in a million years that we would have our first building that we were in because I used to do it out of my home," said Wilson-Batch. "Then we found the place in Homestead, a former doctor's office, and turned it into our headquarters. Again, never in a million years did I think we would go from 5,300 square feet to 33,000 square feet.
"Going through construction during the pandemic, when you get shutdown for 62 days and then you get hit with supply chain issues. And then stuff got stuck with the situation in the Suez Canal when a ship was stuck there. And there were price increases from the time we started until we finished on goods that were needed. I kept thinking, is this really going to happen."
It was her diligence, her never taking no for an answer, never letting a setback stop them, that got them to the finish line, while never missing a beat serving the kids in the community.
"A day after the ribbon cutting, when everything was cleaned up and back to normal, I went into the gym at six in the morning when I normally get to work," said Wilson-Batch. "It was still dark, and I went to the gym, and I laid in the middle of the floor on the logo, and I cried. And I still get emotional about it."
After a brief pause to get her thoughts together again, she continued, showing the passion she has for the foundation.
"I was just thinking, God, we did it," said Wilson-Batch. "I remember when I was standing right there, and it was just dirt. And to be able to take a moment to think about the laughter of the kids, the smiles and a safe place for them to be.
"(Charlie) and I used to say, if we don't do this, who will. And we did it."
That, they did. They were honored at the Ireland Funds Pittsburgh Gala this year, receiving the Patricia R. Rooney Community Impact Award, given to leaders who have produced successful organizational initiatives in response to a significant contemporary problem. The foundation focuses on so many issues, from education to mental health, physical education to nutritional needs. And they hit on everything in between.
And every minute of it, from basketball camps, to classes, to wrapping Christmas gifts, brings joy to Wilson-Batch.
"There is so much I enjoy, so much that brings me joy on a daily basis," said Wilson-Batch. "One thing that stands out happened recently. We ask the parents of the kids in our program to engage because all our programs are free, and we ask our parents to engage in order to keep programs free. We ask them to show up four times during the academic year for their child. We were hosting a dinner for our third and fourth grade kids, and we surprised one of the moms, honoring her for giving back to us and being an outstanding parent. She got introduced, and her son saw her and was so proud. He screamed, 'Mommy, you're the best, you're the best, mom.' He kept saying, 'that's my mom.' That moment for me, and of course my emotional self, I'm sitting there boo-hooing because he was so proud of his mom. In those moments, when kids are able to be fulfilled, when they're able to have that look on their face of just being a kid, those are the things that I live for.
"It's seeing kids accomplish things they didn't think they could accomplish, things they have never done, and they take it on. Those moments make me excited to keep moving forward.
"We're not just a one-off program. We create a tradition, a culture and environment for all to be accepted and welcome. And that's what I love."

In the meantime, here you go. All the answers from the NFL.
* * *
From the NFL:
Q. When does the 2025 free agency signing period begin? A. At 4:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12.
Q. When is the two-day negotiating period for potential unrestricted free agents? A. From 12:00 p.m. ET on Monday, March 10 until 3:59:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12, clubs are permitted to contact and enter into contract negotiations with the certified agents of players who will become unrestricted free agents upon expiration of their 2024 player contracts at 4:00 p.m. ET on March 12. The two-day negotiating period applies only to prospective unrestricted free agents. It does not apply to players who have received, or who may receive, a required tender applicable to the 2025 League Year (e.g., exclusive rights players, restricted free agents, franchise players or transition players).
Q. What are the categories of free agency? A. Players are either "restricted free agents" or "unrestricted free agents." A restricted free agent may be subject to a "qualifying offer." A restricted or unrestricted free agent may be designated by his prior club as its franchise player or transition player.
Q. What is the time period for free agency signings this year? A. For restricted free agents, from March 12 to April 18.
For unrestricted free agents who have received a tender from their prior club by the Monday immediately following the final day of the NFL Draft for the 2025 League Year (i.e., April 28), from March 12 to July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later).
For franchise players, from March 12 until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 11.
For transition players, from March 12 until July 22. After July 22 and until 4 p.m. ET on the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 11, the prior club has exclusive negotiating rights to unrestricted free agents and transition players. If the above-listed players do not sign by November 11, they must sit out the season.
Q. What is the difference between a restricted free agent and an unrestricted free agent? A. In the 2025 league year, players with three accrued seasons who have received a qualifying offer become restricted free agents when their contracts expire at the conclusion of the 2024 league year on March 12. Unrestricted free agents have completed four or more accrued seasons. Upon expiration of his 2024 contract, an unrestricted free agent is free to sign with any club with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club.
Q. What constitutes an "accrued season"? A. Six or more regular season games on a club's active/inactive, reserve/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists.
Q. How do the free agency rules apply to restricted free agents? A. If a player with three accrued seasons has received a "qualifying offer" (a salary tender predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his old club, he can negotiate with any club through April 19. If the restricted free agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a "right of first refusal" on any offer sheet the player signs. If the old club does not match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the amount of its qualifying offer. If an offer sheet is not executed on or before April 18, the player's negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club. In addition, prior to the start of free agency a player who would otherwise be a restricted free agent may be designated by his old club as its franchise player or transition player.
Q. What are the right of first refusal/qualifying offer amounts for players who have completed three accrued seasons? A. For right of first refusal only, a one-year salary of at least $3,263,000.
For right of first refusal and compensation at the player's original draft round, a one-year salary of at least $3,406,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of one second-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $5,346,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of one first-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $7,458,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of only one first-round draft selection, but any provision in the new club's offer sheet waiving or limiting the new club's ability to designate the player as a franchise or transition player is not a principal term and need not be matched by the prior club, a one-year salary of at least $7,958,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
Q. What determines an unrestricted free agent? A. A player with four or more accrued seasons whose contract has expired. He is free to sign with any club, with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club, through July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). At that point, his negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club if by April 28 the old club tendered the player a one-year contract for 110 percent of his prior year's salary. His old club then has until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season (November 11) to sign him. If he does not sign by that date, he must sit out the season. If no tender is offered by April 28, the player can be signed by any club at any time throughout the season.
Q. What determines a franchise player? A. The salary offer by a player's club determines what type of franchise player he is: exclusive or non-exclusive. An "exclusive" franchise player – not free to sign with another club – is offered the greater of (i) the average of the top five salaries at the player's position for the current year as of the end of the restricted free agent signing period on April 18; or (ii) the amount of the required tender for a non-exclusive franchise player, as explained below.
Article 10, Section 2(a)(i) of the CBA sets forth the methodology, known as the "Cap Percentage Average," for calculating the required tender for a non-exclusive franchise player:
The Nonexclusive Franchise Tender shall be a one year NFL Player Contract for (A) the average of the five largest Prior Year Salaries for players at the position . . . at which the Franchise Player participated in the most plays during the prior League Year, which average shall be calculated by: (1) summing the amounts of the Franchise Tags for players at that position for the five preceding League Years; (2) dividing the resulting amount by the sum of the Salary Caps for the five preceding League Years . . . ; and (3) multiplying the resulting percentage by the Salary Cap for the upcoming League Year . . . (the "Cap Percentage Average") . . . ; or (B) 120% of his Prior Year Salary, whichever is greater .
If a club extends a required tender to a "non-exclusive" franchise player pursuant to this section, the player shall be permitted to negotiate a player contract with any club, except that draft-choice compensation of two first-round draft selections shall be made in the event he signs with a new club.
Q. How many franchise players and transition players can a team designate each season? A. A club can designate one franchise player or one transition player among its potential restricted or unrestricted free agents.
Q. Can a club decide to withdraw its franchise or transition designation on a player? A. Yes. A club can withdraw its franchise or transition designation, and the player then automatically becomes an unrestricted free agent, either immediately if the tender is withdrawn after the start of the 2025 league year, or when his 2024 contract expires if the tender is withdrawn before the start of the 2025 league year.
Q. What is the salary cap for 2025? A. The salary cap is $279,200,000 per club.
Q. When must teams be in compliance with the salary cap? A. At the start of the 2025 league year, which begins at 4:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12.
Q. If a team is under the salary cap at the end of a given season, can the team "carry over" room to the next season? A. Yes. A team may carry over room from one league year to the following league year by submitting notice to the NFL prior to 4:00 p.m. ET on the day following the team's final regular-season game, indicating the amount of room that the club wishes to carry over.
Q. What is the maximum amount of room that a club can carry over? A. A club can carry over 100 percent of its remaining 2024 room to its adjusted salary cap for 2025.

Steelers Nation Unite
Steelers Nation says #HereWeGo
Steelers.com
It's the postseason, the time of year when Steelers Nation comes out in full force to show their support for the team.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 11
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
ROBERT YEAGER FROM CANYON COUNTRY, CA: With all the popular options of alternative uniforms in the NFL, have the Steelers ever thought about honoring the gold shoulder pad uniforms? I thought those were very cool/different than other NFL uniforms of the day. ANSWER: I am not privy to the conversations/decisions about selecting a throwback jersey for a particular season, but the uniforms you reference certainly were unique and part of my early memories of the Steelers and the NFL. The following is something I wrote for Steelers.com about the origin of those uniforms and their brief history with the franchise:
In the late 1960s, the Green Bay Packers were the National Football League's dominant team. They had won championships in 1961, 1962, 1965 and 1966, and they had played for the title in 1960. In that respect, every NFL team wanted to be like the Packers.
Dan Rooney might have wanted the Steelers to win like the Packers, but he didn't necessarily want them to look like the Green Bay Packers.
In early 1966, the Steelers players had an executive committee that would meet with ownership about issues that concerned them. At that time, one of the issues was the uniform. John Campbell, a linebacker going into his second season with the team, was on the executive committee, and he was the one who asked Dan Rooney to do something about the uniform.
Mindful of how many teams were morphing into Packers look-a-likes, Dan Rooney decided to make an attempt at something distinctive. That also was the time when the City of Pittsburgh was trying to remake its image, trying to get away from the perception of a dirty, smoky city. One of the areas being refurbished was Downtown, called the "Golden Triangle" because that was the shape of the land created by the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers flowing into the Ohio River.
Dan Rooney decided to incorporate this unique bit of the city's geography into the Steelers new uniforms, and that's how the triangle design came to be a part of the jersey. The triangle was always gold, with the rest of the home jersey being black with white numbers and the road jersey being white with black numbers.
But if the intent of linking the team to its city was a nice idea, the practical execution of it didn't always go smoothly.
For example, washing the uniforms. In 1966, the Steelers preseason finale was against the Cleveland Browns in Birmingham, Ala., and they were to wear the black jerseys with the gold triangles, because the Browns always preferred to wear their white jerseys. But in laundering the Steelers' jerseys, the black bled into the gold triangles and created an aesthetic mess.
And then, not everyone was able to make the connection between the Steelers' jerseys and Pittsburgh's geography. Midway through the 1966 season, the Steelers were set to play a game against the Cowboys in Dallas on Oct. 30. Like the Browns, the Cowboys always preferred to wear white jerseys, and so the Steelers were outfitted in their black jerseys with the gold triangles.
Shortly before kickoff, Dan Rooney appeared on the Cowboys pregame radio show to promote the matchup and he was asked, "Are your wearing those uniforms because tomorrow is Halloween?"
And so following the 1967 season, the Steelers "retired" their golden triangle jerseys for good, but they still remain an interesting part of the franchise's rich history.
MARK THOMPSON FROM HUNTINGTON, WV: Please tell me if this is true. Saw on Facebook that Hines Ward was finally inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Please tell me this is not a dream. ANSWER: I wish it was true, but Hines Ward was not elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2025. The wide receivers who were among the Modern-Era finalists for election in 2025 were Torry Holt, Steve Smith Sr., and Reggie Wayne. The Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2025 was announced last Thursday, and it includes CB Eric Allen, DE Jared Allen, TE Antonio Gates, and WR Sterling Sharpe, who was elected as the Seniors candidate. None of the WRs who were among the Modern Era finalists were elected.
JEFF WELLER FROM COLUMBUS, OH: How is Sterling Sharpe getting inducted into the Hall of Fame and not Hines Ward? Ward has over 400 more catches than Sterling Sharpe. Plus there are Ward's other attributes as a player – blocking, etc. I'm tired of the Steelers fatigue among the voters. Are there any other receivers with that many catches not in the Hall of Fame? ANSWER: As I explained in the previous answer, Sterling Sharpe was elected to the Class of 2025 as the Seniors Candidate, and Jeff Legwold of ESPN.com wrote this about him: "Sharpe's career was cut short by a congenital neck condition, but only Jerry Rice caught more passes and had more touchdown receptions in the 7-season span that Sharpe played. Though his career was shortened by health concerns, Sharpe didn't miss a regular-season game – 112 in all. He was a five-time Pro Bowl selection and a three-time All-Pro selection."
Hines Ward retired with 1,000 catches for 12,083 yards. The players with more than 1,000 catches not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame are Larry Fitzgerald (1,432) and Jason Witten (1,228), both of whom will be first-time eligibles next year, plus Anquan Boldin (1,076), Reggie Wayne (1,070), and Steve Smith Sr. (1,031). The players with more than 12,083 receiving yards are Fitzgerald and Witten, plus Smith Sr. (14,731), Wayne (14,345), Boldin (13,779), Torry Holt (13,382), Irving Fryar (12,785), Brandon Marshall (12,351), and Jimmy Smith (12,287)
KEITH MILLER FROM CANTON, NC: Totally unimportant question proving I need to get a life. If a team scores a touchdown just as time expires to end a quarter, does the extra point count in that quarter or the next? If they don't score again in that next quarter, would the box score show a single point? ANSWER: Points after touchdown, either the 1-point or 2-point versions, are untimed downs, and so if a touchdown was scored as time expired in a quarter the attempt would just be tacked on at that point. In the way the NFL records scoring plays, the touchdown and the point-after are not separated.
PETER HAMMERER FROM BALTIMORE, MD: In a recent Asked and Answered you were asked a question about the number of draft picks the Steelers would have, and you wrote that it will be 7 in the upcoming draft. Everything I've read said they will have 8: one in each of the first five rounds and three in the seventh. Please clarify. ANSWER: I believe I was perfectly clear in the answer to that question. In the 2025 NFL Draft, the Steelers will have 7 picks – 1 pick in each of the first 5 rounds, and the 2 picks in the 7th round.
ANDREW SCHERBIK FROM PORTSMOUTH, VA: We all know that the Steelers 1974 Draft Class was the greatest individual team draft in NFL history, with 4 Hall of Fame players drafted and one undrafted player also being elected to the Hall of Fame. How many other Hall of Fame players were drafted by other teams in that draft class? ANSWER: Besides Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster, the only other player who was drafted in 1974 who went on to be voted to the Hall of Fame was TE Dave Casper, who was selected in the second round (45th overall) by the Oakland Raiders.
GEORGE TAYLOR FROM IRWIN, PA: I have a salary cap question. Has the NFL announced next year's salary cap, and if not when do you expect it to be released? If a team trades for a player with a high cap hit can the team getting the player ask the trading team to eat some of the players salary? ANSWER: The NFL has not yet released the 2025 salary cap. In 2024, the NFL released the salary cap on Feb. 23, and I would expect this year's cap number to become known around the same time. As for your trade question, it is permissible for the acquiring team to ask the trading team to absorb some of the player's salary in order to close a deal.
BRENT CORLEY FROM LOUISVILLE, KY: With the need at several positions such as running back, cornerback, wide receiver, and interior defensive lineman, can you see Pittsburgh drafting a wide receiver in the first round and possibly again in the later rounds, or might it be a combination of the draft and free agency? Not to mention the whole George Pickens situation, which I hope works out for the better. ANSWER: I believe the Steelers must seriously consider spending premium draft picks (first three rounds) on defensive linemen. What they need there is a successor to Cam Heyward, or at least the next Stephon Tuitt. Wide receiver should be addressed, and with top-of-the-depth-chart types at that, but my thought is that it's time for the defensive line to get some serious attention.
FRED MYERS FROM MORGANTOWN, WV: Why is the NFL Draft only limited to 7 rounds, where in the past there were several more rounds? ANSWER: The shortening of the NFL Draft has been done three times since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, and it always has come via negotiations between the owners and players. At the time of the merger, the NFL Draft was 17 rounds, and it stayed that way until 1977 when it dropped to 12 rounds. Then in 1993 with the NFL in the process of adopting free agency tied to a salary cap, the draft was dropped to 8 rounds in 1993 and then to its present 7 rounds in 1994. During the negotiations to reduce the draft, it was generally the players union that was in favor, because the thinking was that fewer draft picks might translate into better job security for veteran players which then translated into higher wages.
PEGGY HAYMAN FROM SYRACUSE, NY: Will the Steelers be offering any packages for the game in Ireland? ANSWER: For information on the Steelers game in Dublin, Ireland, you can visit the Steelers FAQ page which provides all the details and will be updated as more information is available.
KEVAN McGUIRE FROM ISLE OF WHITHORN, SCOTLAND: I think I saw somewhere that the Steelers will be playing a regular season game in Dublin, Ireland in 2025. Have you any info about dates and how to get tickets? We were at Pittsburgh for the Chargers game on Sept. 22. It was Julie's first game, and we had a great time. ANSWER: Since it will be a regular season game that the Steelers will be hosing in Dublin, the NFLis responsible for the sale and distribution of tickets. The NFL will announce ticket details later this offseason. Steelers.com will have all the information when available and you can check the Steelers FAQ page for the latest details.

An appreciation for those who made a difference
Steelers.com
In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today, multiple players share why Black History Month is significant in their lives.
February has been set aside as a time to celebrate Black History, to remember the contributions made by the men and women through the years that a lot of Americans are unaware of.
But for Cameron Sutton, he wants to make sure that history is celebrated year round.
"You can never just put Black history in a month," said Sutton. "I get the term of it. The appreciation for what it's for. There are so many stories that we're not aware of that changed the trajectory of the world. It's time for everyone to keep educating yourselves."
Education.
That is a word so many Steelers players point to when talking about Black history, wanting to educate themselves continually and wanting others to do the same.
"In elementary school, and the school system in general, I don't feel like we learned too much about Black history," said linebacker Malik Reed. "It seemed like it was a small amount. I think it's important for kids nowadays to learn Black history and get the accounts and stories of things that have been accomplished over the years. See where we have come from and where we are now.
"I stand firm in my faith I think God is a huge reason why we are where we are today. Me and my wife like to read up on different stories whether it's Black people that invented something back in the day. I like to dive in to educate each other and continue to grow in that area."
Safety Miles Killebrew knows the more you educate yourself, the more you can recognize those who have made a difference, which includes people in the history of the country, as well as people who are making a difference today.
"My father is Black, I am of mixed decent, Black and White," said safety Miles Killebrew. "Anytime there is an opportunity to recognize someone in this country for their unique background or their diversity or whatever it is, I think it's important to recognize that because that is what makes this country so special.
"It's a great reminder to spread love in our community. I would say that this is a time when the Nation needs a lot more love and I want to be at the forefront of that with the guys around me."
While Black History Month is celebrated in February, for these players and countless others that history is something that is celebrated year-round.
"It's important because it celebrates equality and it's fighting for equal rights for all people," said linebacker Alex Highsmith. "You recognize that every single day and celebrate that. I think it's important for me just being part African American, just recognizing that and continuing to celebrate what we have been given as equal rights."

Steelers Nation Unite
Bogo is proud to represent the black and gold
Steelers.com
As David Bogo stood on the sidelines at Acrisure Stadium, just a few hours before the Steelers were taking on the Tennessee Titans on Thursday Night Football, he was nothing but smiles.
He was enjoying the excitement of being up close and personal with the team, enjoying it along with his father, two daughters, and granddaughter, all of them decked out in Steelers gear from head to toe.
He thought he was there because he was randomly chosen as a season ticket holder to have pregame field access.
But he was there for a lot more.
As his family posed for a picture on the field, tight end Pat Freiermuth came from behind and stepped into the shot and gave Bogo the surprise of a lifetime, sharing with him that he was selected as the 2023 Steelers Fan of the Year.
His reaction was priceless. He stared at Freiermuth in shock, barely able to utter anything other than thank you as he was handed a custom jersey and presented with tickets to Super Bowl LVII.
"I don't even know what's going on," said Bogo. "Are you sure you got the right person? I don't know man. This is crazy.
"I don't even know what that means."
He soon found out.
All 32 teams select a Fan of the Year with each one attending Super Bowl LVII in Las Vegas as the guest of the NFL. One winner is selected, which includes fan voting, to be the NFL Fan of the Year.
And Bogo is representing the black and gold proudly.
-->> **Vote Now for David Bogo for NFL Fan of the Year**
"I don't think they got it right. I don't think I'm the guy for that," said Bogo. "I'm just a good fan. I just like the Steelers. So, this is a little crazy.
"It's a bit overwhelming for me. I'm not the guy that likes attention like that. So, I'm not used to it, but it's awesome. I'm a little off right now, but I am so excited."
Bogo is a lifelong Steelers fan, something passed down to him from his father, who became a fan in the 1970s after moving from Italy to Pittsburgh.
"He came over from Italy in the early seventies, late sixties, right when the Steelers took off," said Bogo. "He moved here to Pittsburgh and then became a Steelers fan because of the runs, the Super Bowls, and all that stuff. And then when I was born and he just kind of passed it down. I passed it down to my daughter, who is a diehard, crazy person, and then my granddaughter, who is amazing."
Bogo's life took him on some distant travels when he was in the U.S. Army as an Army Police Officer, and after that as a senior security consultant, including time in Iraq and Afghanistan post September 11 attacks. While he was away from the people and things he loved the most, he always remained close to them, especially his family and Steelers football.
"Steelers football was so helpful when I was away. I always brought a Terrible Towel with me. This is one of them that I brought with me, and I wrote on it wherever I was for big games," said Bogo, proudly holding up the Terrible Towel that did look like it had seen better days. "I have where I was for playoff games, Super Bowl, big wins.
"When we were over there later on, when there was internet, I would get up early and call my daughters and they would point the webcam at home onto the television and I would try to watch the game with them, to try to do that. Steelers football is more of a homey thing for me, a family thing."
Steelers football is so much of a 'homey thing,' that it actually brought Bogo back to his roots in Pittsburgh.
After his deployment, and working as a reserve deputy sheriff, he continued his work in the security industry in Denver, Colorado, where the family would settle.
But his heart was always in Pittsburgh, always with the Steelers. Each fall the family would take a trip to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game, the love for the team growing with each visit.
"Every year we went on vacation, instead of in the summer it would be in the fall we would try to marry up the Penguins game on a Saturday night and a Steelers game on Sunday because they like the Pens too," said Bogo. "That's what we did. It was something that everybody was excited for. We knew we were going to go down to the Strip District because we're Italian and get a lot of good Italian food. I'd give them an allowance to go buy whatever Steelers stuff they wanted and just have a good long weekend with everybody, see some Steelers football, enjoy Pittsburgh and all that stuff."
All the while they made the trips to Pittsburgh, Bogo's name was on the Steelers season ticket waiting list. And after 19 years of waiting, his wish came true.
The email came delivering the news.
Four season tickets were available for him to buy.
So, he did what any diehard Steelers fan would do. He quit his job in Colorado and moved to Pittsburgh.
Okay, not every diehard Steelers fan would do that. Actually, it takes a pretty unique person to do that.
But for Bogo, it was the right decision. His youngest daughter is going to the University of Pittsburgh and his oldest daughter, Giovana, was more than happy to move with her dad and young daughter to Pittsburgh, as her love of the Steelers is just as great as her dad.
"This is an interesting story," said Bogo. "My ex-wife called me because it was her email address on the account, but my name and she said, 'Hey, they just let you know that your tickets came through. And I said, 'What are you talking about?' And she said, 'Your Steelers tickets. Do you want them?' I was like, 'Yeah.' So, she put them in my email address and then I was thinking how do I get them? What do I do? I didn't know. And then I got them.
"When I got them and finally knew that they were mine, there were a little bit of tears in the house. And then my daughters are pretty happy because they knew having season tickets for me was a bucket list thing, to be back in Pittsburgh, hopefully for a long time, retire here and go to the games is what I've always wanted to do.
"Moving here, I've had a really bad couple of years, and I needed a change and I literally quit my job. I was an executive, doing corporate stuff. I was kind of done with it. I needed a change from everything. So, I literally grabbed the tickets and moved here without a job or anything and figured it out. And now, everything's working."
It was his oldest daughter, Giovana, who nominated her dad to be the Steelers Fan of the Year, not just because of his love for the Steelers, but his love and dedication to his family and country.
"My whole life, my dad's literally done everything for us to have the life that we have and he is the most selfless person I know," she said. "I'm sure people say that about their parents, I really mean it. He has done everything for me and my little sister to have the world. I had a little girl when I was in college, and he let me move back home and is helping to raise my daughter because I am by myself doing it. He takes care of her so I can go back to school and get my education, but still have her. He supports us in everything we do. I just think he deserves recognition of his own for all he's done for us.
"And watching football is something that me and dad and my daughter always bonded over. I probably know more football than most men in the world. I'm very proud to say that. I'm crazy about football and that's because of my dad. It's just something really special that we share. He quit his job in July because it was our turn on the season ticket list to move here to have season tickets because he's been waiting for so long.
"This means more than you could imagine. Growing up, he was in and out because he was serving our country. A lot of times he will say he is upset that I wasn't there when you guys were kids, but it was for a good reason because he was protecting everyone else in the country. I think that's so important. I have so much respect for him because of that. I'm thankful he's still here. You have some people who obviously didn't make it. I'm just really blessed and thankful that I got to grow up with a dad that took the initiative to serve our country and protect us all so that we could live day to day life like we do."
And for the Bogo family, day to day life now is so much different. It's in a city they love, surrounded by so much they love.
"Seeing my dad this happy, it's probably one of the most amazing things ever," she said of going to game together now. "He's had a lot of tough experiences in his life and just to see him not have to think about anything and just have pure joy is something that I always wished I could see and now that I can see that, it's pretty awesome.
"I've literally prayed for this for him I don't even know how long. And now that we're living it, it's just honestly, like dreams do come true."
And it is a dream come true. As Bogo stared around the stadium taking it all in, trying to process what happened to him, his eyes locked on the fifth level in a far corner.
"Those are our seats up there," said Bogo, pointing high up. "We are in the far corner, second row from the top, on the very end. And I love that. Those are our seats. It's awesome. We have seats in the stadium, and I can see everything and it's all good."

Warren is Digest Player of the Week
Steelers.com
JAYLEN WARREN Running Back
There weren't a lot of bright spots and the few that could be classified as such ring hollow in light of the 29-10 loss to Kansas City on Christmas Day at Acrisure Stadium.
Jaylen Warren rushed for 71 yards on 11 carries (6.5 average), and he caught 5 passes for 41 more yards to finish the game with 112 yards from scrimmage on 16 touches. The 71 yards rushing represented a season high for Warren. He is the Steelers Digest Player of the Week.
Also considered were DT Cam Heyward, who had 4 tackles, including 1 for loss, plus 1 of the 2 hits on the quarterback managed by the Steelers defense; WR George Pickens, who caught 3 passes for 50 yards and had another reception for 14 yards nullified by an offside penalty; RB Najee Harris, who rushed for 74 yards on 13 carries (5.7 average) to bring his total on the season to 1,007 yards; and Patrick Queen and Minkah Fitzpatrick, who each had 7 tackles to share the team lead in that category.

How he fits: Kyle Allen
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers have signed veteran backup quarterback Kyle Allen to a free agent contract.
Heading into his seventh NFL season, Allen spent 2023 with the Buffalo Bills backing up Josh Allen. He played just 38 snaps in 2023.
But Allen has started 19 games in his career after entering the league with Carolina as an undrafted rookie in 2018 after playing collegiately at Texas A&M and Houston.
Allen posted a 4.71-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine.
He started one game as a rookie in 2018, appearing in two games total, while completing 20 of 31 passes for 266 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.

The following season, he appeared in a career-high 13 games, starting 12, with the Panthers going 5-7 in his starts as he completed 62 percent of his passes for 3,322 yards with 17 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.
In his career, Allen has completed 62.6 percent of his passes for 4,734 yards with 26 touchdowns and 21 interceptions, posting an 82.2 passer rating. He owns a 7-12 record overall as a starting quarterback.
Allen has largely bounced around the league as a backup since then and will battle for a backup spot on the Steelers' roster this season as the No. 3 quarterback behind a quarterback room that now also includes Russell Wilson and Justin Fields.
The Steelers traditionally believe in keeping three quarterbacks on their roster, and likely will add a fourth to take to training camp.

5 for Friday: Turnover culture matters
Contributing Writer/Editor
Turnovers, particularly when it comes to recovering fumbles can be a fickle mistress.
After all, the football is oblong, not round. When it bounces around on the ground, it often does so in ways that cannot be predetermined the same way a player can guess where a round ball will wind up.
The Steelers are tied for the NFL lead in forced fumbles this season with 20, including another one in Wednesday's 29-10 loss to the Chiefs when Mark Robinson jarred the ball loose on a punt return.
But much like what happened the previous week against the Ravens, when the Steelers forced two fumbles and failed to recover either one, it was the Chiefs who came up with the loose ball instead of the Steelers.
"We're not being opportunistic on the defense or on our the special teams side when given an opportunity," said head coach Mike Tomlin. "We had balls on the ground in terms of opportunities a week ago that we didn't capitalize on, and then we're not securing them on offense."
As we've seen, it's not a winning combination, especially when the Steelers' offense is turning the ball over – not at a ridiculous clip, mind you, but turning it over nonetheless.
The Steelers entered Week 17 at plus-17 in turnover margin this season. Only the Buffalo Bills at plus-20 were better. But after failing to record a turnover against the Chiefs while turning it over twice themselves, they're now at plus-15.
It's a great margin, to be sure. In fact, entering this week, only six teams in the NFL had a turnover margin of plus-10 or more. Not surprisingly, all six of those teams (Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Green Bay, Houston, the Chargers and Minnesota) had winning records.
But, like the Steelers, the Texans in their past two games – not coincidentally against the Chiefs and Ravens – lost the turnover battle, 3-0, failing to force a miscue in those games. And they lost those games, 27-19 and 31-2.
The Steelers did force a turnover in their games against the Ravens and Chiefs, getting a Minkah Fitzpatrick interception. But, like the Texans, they came out of those games minus-3 in turnover ratio. Against good teams, that's a losing proposition.
Look at the Steelers' win over the Ravens earlier this season for proof of that. The Steelers won the turnover battle, 3-1, in that game and beat Baltimore.
Coming into this season, they were 0-18 since 2000 when they lost the turnover battle. The results have not been quite as dramatic this season, as they're 2-3 in games this season in which they lose the turnover battle.
But they're also just 1-2 in the three games this season in which they didn't force a single turnover.
"We have regressed in terms of our turnover culture," said Tomlin. "In terms of maintaining possession of the ball and getting the ball, we've been a plus group in most instances. And that's really been a catalyst for us in terms of the games unfolding the way that we desire. The last two weeks in particular we haven't been plus in that area, we've been minus in that area. So the results are what they are."
Perhaps it shouldn't be that cut and dried, but when you're playing against other very good teams, it often is the case.
• The Steelers are currently on a three-game losing streak and have fallen to 10-6.
They'll get a chance to get an 11th win next weekend when they host the Bengals. More importantly, they'll get a chance to end that three-game skid.
But what will it mean?
Perhaps a lot.
You don't have to look far to find situations where teams have lost three games in a row during a season and rebounded to have success.
The Rams in 2021 lost three games in a row in Weeks 9-11 and also lost their regular season finale, finishing 11-5. They beat the Cardinals, Buccaneers, 49ers and Bengals in the postseason to win the Super Bowl.
In 2012, the Ravens lost four of their final five games, including three-straight in Weeks 13-15 and the regular season finale to finish 10-6. They then beat the Colts, Broncos, Patriots and 49ers to win the Super Bowl.
In 2011, the Giants lost four games in a row from Weeks 10-13, yet still snuck into the playoffs at 9-7. They beat the Falcons, Packers, 49ers and Patriots to win the Super Bowl.
In 2010, the Packers twice had stretches during the season when they lost three out of four games. But they finished 10-6 and beat the Eagles, Falcons, Bears and Steelers to win the Super Bowl.
The 2009 Saints lost their final three games of the season after starting 13-0. Despite going into the postseason on a three-game losing streak, they beat the Cardinals, Vikings and Colts to win the Super Bowl.
Good teams can have bad stretches of play or stretches where the ball doesn't bounce their way. Those are just four very recent examples of that exact thing happening.
The key is that the team doesn't lose focus or panic.
"You look back, and no matter what the circumstances are, you can look back and if we had won all three games and everything else, you look back and you go into the playoffs and you're not prepared and you don't play right, and it's over," said quarterback Russell Wilson. "Or you can lose these three games and respond the right way and be ready to go.
"I think that there's highs and lows in every season, like I said, and so we've got to make sure that we end this last game on the right footing and right belief, and that's going to be really key to how we go about it and how we respond."
• Here's a little perspective. If the Steelers beat the Bengals next weekend, they'll finish the regular season with 11 wins. If they don't, they'll finish with 10.
If they get to 11 wins, they will have reached a level of victories in which just seven Steelers teams in the 2000s have achieved. And let's remember that the Steelers have won two Super Bowls, advanced to another and also played in the AFC Championship six times since 2000.
If the Steelers finish with 10 wins, they'll still have surpassed their win total from 10 of the previous 25 seasons and at least matched their win total from four others.
Also remember that the 2005 Steelers were an 11-win team that went on to win the Super Bowl, while the 11-win team in 2016 advanced to the AFC Championship.
It's all about playing well at the right time of the season. And perhaps this latest three-game stretch is enough to remind this team of the things on which it really needs to focus its energies.
• The Steelers aren't crying and bemoaning the fact that they had to play three games in 11 days because the Chiefs, Ravens and Texans all had to do the same.
"They had to deal with it too. They had a short week just like us," linebacker Alex Highsmith said after the loss to Kansas City. "They had to come on the road. There's no excuses for what happened."
There isn't.
It can, however, be a reason for what happened. And that's not making an excuse for it.
If a team plays one bad game, it gets a chance to spend a full week preparing and correcting its issues.
If it plays two bad games in a row, you can bet the focus in practices will be on correcting the things that are happening.

However, when you play three games in 11 days, it doesn't allow a lot of time for reflection. Or correction. Or preparation. Or studying your opponents' tendencies to find a weakness.
In games such as these, it comes down to talent and execution. Game-planning be damned, it's more about the Jimmies and Joes, rather than the Xs and Os.
The Steelers were simply beaten by the Eagles in their building on a regular work week. The Eagles clearly outplayed and outschemed them.
But the past two losses against the Ravens and most certainly the Chiefs on short work weeks have been all about the talent on the other sideline. And few would argue that Baltimore's Lamar Jackson or Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes aren't among the most talented quarterbacks in the league. Throw a healthy dose of Derrick Henry into the equation, as the Ravens did against the Steelers and then Wednesday against the Texans, and you'll get the results that occurred.
That doesn't excuse it. You're still allowed to make plays to combat or nullify star players. And the Steelers have some star players of their own.
But it is the reality of the situation.
It's also a reality that in the postseason, nobody will be asked to play a game on three or four days' rest. There will be time to prepare.
• The two-game lineup the NFL put on Christmas Day isn't going anywhere.
Despite being on a Wednesday this season and with 1 and 4:30 starts, both the Steelers' game at Acrisure Stadium against the Chiefs and the Texans' game against the Ravens at NRG Stadium got massive viewership.
According to Nielson, the two games, which were shown nationally on Netflix, a first for the NFL, drew nearly 65 million viewers.
The Steelers' game against Kansas City had an average viewership of 24.1 million, while the Texans' game against the Ravens drew an average of 24.3 million later in the day. Both are totals for the United States only.
Global ratings and additional numbers for viewership in the United States will be released Dec. 31.
This was the first season of the NFL's three-year deal with Netflix to broadcast games on Christmas Day. Next season, Christmas Day will fall on on a Thursday, a more natural day since the NFL already has regularly scheduled Thursday night games. In 2026, Christmas will be on a Friday.
Given the days of the week Christmas falls on the next two years, the NFL doesn't have to have the teams involved in those games play on Saturday leading into that week, though it could still choose to do so.

5 for Friday: Steelers don't take success against Jackson lightly
Contributing Writer/Editor
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Detroit Pistons had what they called the "Jordan Rules" to stop Michael Jordan of the Bulls from beating them.
They played physically with Jordan every chance they got, bumping him, muscling him off the ball whenever possible and beating him up when he attempted to perform one of his high-flying drives to the basket.
Early in his career, the Jordan Rules were effective. Jordan would get his points, but the Pistons, a good team in their own right, more than held their own against the Bulls. In fact, Jordan's record as a member of the Bulls against Detroit was 33-31 in the regular season and 10-12 in the postseason.
The Pistons eliminated the Bulls from the playoffs in three consecutive seasons – until they didn't – and Jordan and the Bulls finally beat the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals in 1991.
We bring this up this week because thus far in Lamar Jackson's young career, the Steelers have had the two-time MVP's number. Jackson is now 1-4 in five career starts against the Steelers in his career. He's thrown just five touchdown passes and eight interceptions in those games, posting a passer rating of 66.7. He's also fumbled 7 times, losing 3, while being sacked 22 times.
Considering Jackson is 66-19 against the rest of the league with 153 touchdown passes and 40 interceptions with a passer rating of 104.1 against every other team in the league, it's a significant difference.
The Steelers don't take that for granted. They understand how dangerous Jackson is as a player. And because of that, they take the approach to defending Jackson to make sure they're physical with him when they can be within the rules of the game.
But they also understand that past success doesn't mean that it will happen every time. They have to be mindful of Jackson's ability to change games.
"Lamar is the most electric guy in the league right now," said Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward. "His shiftiness, the play extension, he's second to none in that regard. You've got an arm that's a canon. Each week, you just see a highlight from him. I don't think anyone compares."
The key might be the Steelers' ability to pressure Jackson with their four-man pass rush.
Jackson has been the best quarterback in the league when blitzed this season, completing 68.5 percent of his passes in those situations compared to 67.8 percent when he hasn't.
But when he's pressured, his completion percentage drops to 49.6 percent, compared to 76 percent when he is not pressured.
So, if he beats blitzes but struggles against pressure, you'd better be able to do so with four players. That is something the Steelers are certainly capable of doing.
A big part of that comes from T.J. Watt. Watt has 17 sacks in 15 career games against the Ravens. That is tied for the most by any current NFL player against a single opponent. The player with which Watt is tied for the most sacks against a single opponent? Himself against the Browns, against whom he also has 17 sacks in his career (He has 14 against the Bengals).
Watt also has 8.5 sacks in his career against Jackson, the most any player has sacked Jackson in his career. That has come in five games. The next-closest player is Cleveland's Myles Garrett, who has sacked Jackson 5.5 times – in 11 games.
So, if you pressure Jackson, keep him in the pocket and don't let him make big plays – which he is more apt to do when he escapes that pressure – you have a chance.
"We did a really good job in terms of eliminating a lot of really big plays," Steelers defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said of the first meeting with Baltimore this season. "Did a good job in terms of tackling. You have to be able to tackle against this group. One of the things they're really good at is yards after catch, yards after contact, and so I thought we did a really good job of that and that eliminated big plays. Made them have to drive the field, and so we felt pretty comfortable that if it was long drives, that those usually work in the defense's favor."
Will it work again against Jackson? That's what we'll find out Saturday.
Both teams will make adjustments. And the team that adjusts the best could be the one that walks away a winner.

• One of the reasons the Steelers might have so much success against the Ravens of late is that they control tight end Mark Andrews.
Last week in a win over the Giants, Andrews caught his 48th career touchdown pass, the most in Ravens history. That came in his 101st career game, meaning he averages about one touchdown every two games during his career.
In 10 career games against the Steelers, Andrews has yet to score a touchdown. That included a two-catch, 22-yard effort on three targets in the Steelers' 18-16 win earlier this season at Acrisure Stadium.
By comparison, in 13 career games each against the Bengals and Browns, Andrews has caught eight and 10 touchdown passes. The only team other than the Steelers who have faced Andrews at least five times and not allowed him to score are the Chiefs. Not surprisingly, the Ravens are 1-4 in those games against Kansas City.
In that game earlier this season, the Steelers had safety Minkah Fitzpatrick match up on Andrews a lot of the time, taking Jackson's favorite target out of the equation.
Andrews has eight touchdown catches this season, all of which have come in the red zone. He's clearly the player to which Jackson looks to the most when the Ravens are inside the 20-yard line.
"I think they have weapons obviously. (It) starts with the quarterback, but Mark Andrews has been his favorite target since he's been in the league and he's really starting to come into his own," Austin said. "I know he was banged up earlier in the season but he's rounding into form and always been a really, really tough player to guard. I know in my six years here he's gotten our full attention. He'll continue to get it, but he is getting better every week."
Austin isn't wrong. After not catching a touchdown pass in Baltimore's first four games, Andrews has eight in the past nine games.
• It really shouldn't be too big a surprise the Steelers have struggled to generate a lot of passing yards the past two games without George Pickens on the field because of a hamstring injury, even though they have split those two games.
Take any No. 1 receiver out of any offense in the league and it's going to be a struggle, particularly when looking at the circumstances involved. Pickens was a surprise scratch two weeks ago against Cleveland after suffering the injury late in the week, while last week's opponent, the Eagles, boast the league's top passing defense.
But Pickens, who has already been declared out for Saturday's game in Baltimore, also is the league's best big-play threat.
Despite missing the past two games, Pickens continues to lead the NFL with 12 receptions of 30 or more yards. He also leads the NFL with 14 receptions on passes that traveled 20 or more yards in the air, gaining 474 of his team-best 850 yards on those catches.
It's not that the other players on the roster can't catch deep passes – they have nine such plays for 276 yards on deep passes this season – but Pickens is a matchup issue, and opponents defend the Steelers differently when he's not on the field.
"Yeah, in certain aspects," said Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. "Same thing if you're playing with a new center or the third tackle coming in. They change the rush plan. Those are games within the game all over the place. Certainly, it probably changes their calls schematically."
• All that being said about Pickens, Calvin Austin III has put together a solid season in what is essentially his second year in the NFL.
Austin missed his rookie season because of an injury suffered during training camp and had just 17 receptions for 180 yards and one touchdown in 2023 when the Steelers struggled as a whole in the passing game.
He did, however, rush for 57 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries while also averaging a very solid 8.6 yards per punt return.
This season, he's made a jump across the board in all of his numbers, catching 28 passes for 452 yards and four touchdowns, a very healthy 16.1 yards per catch average. Last week against the Eagles, Austin caught a career-best five passes on five targets for 65 yards with Pickens sidelined.
He's also averaging 11.3 yards per punt return with a touchdown, as well, tying him with Najee Harris and Justin Fields for the second-most touchdowns on the team behind tight end Pat Freiermuth.
At 5-foot-9 and 162 pounds, Austin was viewed by many as a specialty player who needed to be schemed up to get the ball. But if you watched his college tape at Memphis, it was apparent that was not the case. He's proving that in the NFL. Yes, he works in the slot. But he's also perfectly capable of winning outside the numbers, as well.
"He's been spectacular. I mean, ever since he came to San Diego, I got to spend time with him and go to dinner and hang out and throw and work out together," said Wilson. "I just was just incredibly excited about him and who he is as a player, as a person, as a competitor. He has the grit, the guts to be able to play hard and be a smaller guy, that's not easy to do, to be honest with you. He reminds me a lot of Tyler Lockett in terms of his ability to understand and process on the move and see things, and he just has an appetite for learning.
"I think that anytime you have an appetite for learning and processing and growing, I think you've got a great chance. And he definitely has that. Obviously, his speed and his ability in out of his cuts is spectacular. He can do it all. He's been one of the biggest highlights, I think, not just of the Pittsburgh Steelers, but in the National Football League, in terms of a guy that's up and coming and has a great chance to be really special."
Austin was among the Steelers' pass catchers who went to California to work with Russell Wilson in the offseason soon after the quarterback signed with the team. And it's paying dividends.
• There aren't a lot of secrets when it comes to a game between Mike Tomlin and Baltimore's John Harbaugh.
Saturday's meeting between the Steelers and Ravens will mark the 37th meeting between the two teams in which Tomlin and Harbaugh are on the sidelines.
Tomlin is 21-15 in those meetings, having won eight of the past nine.

It's the second-most games in NFL history in which two head coaches have faced each other behind Curly Lambeau and George Halas.
Of course, in the first several years of that matchup, both Lambeau and Halas also played in those games. Both essentially founded their respective teams when they were with the Packers and Bears.
But when two coaches face off that much, it's difficult for one or the other to surprise the other. It's almost like playing chess against the same person over a period of several days. You begin to learn a lot about the other's thought process.
That's what makes the Steelers' current streak against the Ravens so interesting. Though Jackson has started just five games for the Ravens against the Steelers, it's not as if he's never been available.
And Jackson just might be the most dynamic player in the NFL.
Despite that, Tomlin has still had the upper hand in this matchup.

Steelers make moves ahead of start of free agency
Steelers.com
The Steelers tendered an offer to running back Jaylen Warren, signed center Ryan McCollum to a one-year contract and released defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi.
Warren is restricted free agent and by tendering an offer, the Steelers reserve the right to retain Warren by matching any offer sheet he would sign with another team. Warren could also remain with Pittsburgh by signing its tender offer for the 2025 season or by signing a long-term contract with the Steelers.
Warren originally signed with the Steelers as an undrafted free agent following the 2022 NFL Draft, making the 53-man roster from the start.
In three seasons, Warren appeared in 48 games, not making any starts. He has 346 carries for 1,674 yards, a 4.8-yard average, and six touchdowns. He also has 127 receptions for 894 yards, a 7.0-yard average.
In 2024, Warren appeared in 15 games, finishing with 120 carries for 511 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and one touchdown.
He had his best season in 2023, appearing in 17 games and finishing with career highs with 149 carries for 784 yards, a 5.3-yard average, and four touchdowns. He also had 61 receptions for 370 yards, both career highs, for a 6.1-yard average.
In his rookie season, Warren carried the ball 77 times for 379 yards, a 4.9-yard average, and one touchdown in 16 games, working as Najee Harris' backup. He added 28 receptions for 214 yards, a 7.6-yard average.
He had one of his best games of the season in Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens, with season highs of 12 carries for 76 yards.
Warren finished his college career at Oklahoma State, where he played one season. He was named the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year by the league's head coaches. He had 256 carries for 1,216 yards and 11 touchdowns. He played two seasons at Utah State and started as a JUCO product at Snow College.
McCollum spent the 2022 and 2023 seasons on the Steelers practice squad, before being on the active roster in 2024. He appeared in 17 games in 2024, starting two at center when Zach Frazier was injured.
McCollum signed with the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie free agent following the 2021 NFL Draft. He was then signed by the Detroit Lions, appearing in 13 games, with one start.
In four seasons, he has appeared in 30 regular season games, starting three, and one post season game.
He played college football at Texas A&M where he started 10 games at center his senior season.
Ogunjobi has appeared in 124 regular-season games, starting 108, in his eight seasons in the NFL, including the last three years with the Steelers. He has 361 tackles, including 199 solo stops, 79 quarterback hits, 27.5 sacks, 56 tackles for a loss, three passes defensed, three forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. In his three seasons in Pittsburgh he appeared in 48 games, with 45 starts, and recorded 132 tackles, including 62 solo stops, 26 quarterback hits, six sacks, 15 tackles for loss, two passes defensed, one forced fumble and two fumble recoveries.
Ogunjobi has been a standout in the community and was the Steelers nominee for the 2024 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.

Craig Wolfley, 66
Steelers.com
He spent most of his adult life working within the world of professional sports, and his world was not one for the faint of heart. Football, and in the middle of the line of scrimmage at that. Boxing. Sumo wrestling. Martial arts. Competitive weight lifting. In all of those, he was a combatant, a hand-to-hand warrior who gave as good as he got, a man who didn't have it in him to back down from a fight.
But that was only one part of the man. If you weren't opposite him on a line of scrimmage, or in boxing's square-circle, or in any of those other mano-a-mano competitive confrontations, Craig Wolfley was a kind and gentle soul. Loving, supportive, understanding, giving of his time and of himself, fiercely loyal.
Craig Wolfley died on March 10. He was 66.
"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Craig Wolfley, a beloved member of the Pittsburgh Steelers family," said President Art Rooney II. "Craig was an outstanding player who brought both toughness and heart to the field during his 10 seasons with the Steelers. As an offensive lineman, his grit and dedication were essential to our success, contributing to the solid foundation of the Steelers' offensive line in the 1980s. His work ethic and commitment to excellence were felt both in the locker room and on the field, and his leadership was always evident.
"Following his retirement from playing, Craig seamlessly transitioned into a broadcaster, providing insightful commentary and analysis as part of the Steelers Audio Network. His passionate voice and deep understanding of the game made him a trusted figure for Steelers fans, and his humor, warmth, and enthusiasm left a lasting impact on our community.
"On behalf of the entire Steelers organization, we offer our deepest condolences to Craig's family, friends, and all who had the privilege of knowing him."
A fifth-round pick (138th overall) in the 1980 NFL Draft out of Syracuse University, Wolfley was part of the class that also brought Tunch Ilkin to the team in the sixth round (165th overall) from Indiana State. Wolfley and Ilkin spent five-plus NFL seasons holding down the left side of the Steelers offensive line, and the men became best of friends. The depth of that friendship came across on the air during broadcasts of "In the Locker Room with Tunch and Wolf" on Steelers Nation Radio, and then also during the Steelers Audio Network's broadcasts of games when Wolfley was added to the Bill Hillgrove-Tunch Ilkin team as the sideline reporter. And that relationship seemed to grow up until Ilkin's death in September 2021.
"Training camp was always easy (doing the two-hour talk show with Wolf every day)," Mr. Ilkin once said about their time together as broadcasters. "Wolf and I would compare training camp today with what training camp was like when we were playing. I had fun doing 'Inside the Locker Room,' and if we weren't doing it together, I never would've done a five-days-a-week show. I did it with him, and we did it well together. I also loved it when Wolf joined the broadcast team and would come along on road trips. We continued to be roommates on those trips like we were as players. We would sit on a bench outside and have a cigar when we got to the hotel, and then we'd have another one before we'd get on the bus to go to the stadium for the game the next day."
After Ilkin's death, Wolfley partnered with Max Starks on the 2-hour, 5-day-a-week talk show on SNR and then moved into the booth alongside Hillgrove when Starks was added as the sideline reporter.
Wolfley quickly became known for his on-air delivery, which could be described as high-energy mixed with a penchant for making up words to emphasize a point, but he had learned about the need to study film during a career where he played along with Mike Webster and Larry Brown and he understood the importance of technique and fundamentals from being coached by Chuck Noll.
One of the skills Wolfley showcased during the last decade or so was his writing ability, as in long-form pieces that were analytical, anecdotal, and enjoyable to read. That he could be seen huddled over a notebook with a pen writing his stories by hand in cursive only added to the self-deprecating way he always viewed his own work. But Craig Wolfley could write. And he knew football, and he loved the Steelers.
"Just the energy and the passion that he brought to life," said Charlie Batch. "Not just from a Steelers perspective, but he genuinely cared about people … "Ultimately, he was able to share that as he went from the sideline to the booth. And he brought a different element. People enjoyed listening to him … The older I got in my playing career, knowing that I wanted to transition into that media side, he would give me tips and little things that he may have done that helped him get to that transition point. And then ultimately, having the chance to work with him and Tunch Ilkin on different shows. They were two peas in a pod."
That was Craig Wolfley after his playing career. During his 12-year playing career, he was a full-time starter in the interior of an NFL line of scrimmage during the 1980s, and he had the demeanor required of that job description.
"I remember our first encounter in camp was a fight," said Edmund Nelson, a defensive tackle who came to the Steelers as a No. 7 pick (172nd overall) from Auburn in the 1982 NFL Draft. "He was the first guy that I went up against in the Oklahoma drills Chuck Noll used to have. Me and him went at it the first day that the veterans reported up to camp. He body-slammed me on the first play, and then I body-slammed him on the second play. Then we just went at it. Craig and I told this story all the time, that by the time the end of practice came, we were so tired and so beat, we grabbed each other and helped each other up the hill to the locker room. That was Craig Wolfley in a nutshell. We would go at each other in camp, and then we were buddies at the end of the day. Craig lived in the same area as me after playing … Him and I would see each other every home game, and we greeted each other with a big hug. And in that hug, there was something that was 45 years' worth of friendship old. There was just a genuineness to him, a good God-fearing man. That's the main thing … I'm going to miss my hugs from Craig."
Said Dermontti Dawson: "Wolf had a bigger-than-life personality. And he was a man of faith. God was No. 1 in his life … He was upbeat all the time. And he called you 'brother,' and that was his thing. He would always call you 'brother,' and it's because you truly were family to him."
And Wolfley's "family" extended into the community, where he participated in blood drives, walks to raise money, would contribute to a charitable gathering by grabbing the microphone and entertaining the assembled group with stories about his playing and broadcasting careers. "He was truly one of those unique human beings," said Merril Hoge. "He was genuine, fair and kind. That's a pretty good recipe."
Bill Hillgrove: "Not only in the booth, but out of the booth, Wolf was a special person. The last couple of years when I was working the Steelers games, between two knee replacements and a back operation, I struggled to carry my luggage on and off the plane during road trips. Wolf always made sure he got it up and down the steps or out of the overhead bin. He was so kind in that regard … Wolf was a naturally funny man. He didn't try to be funny. He just was naturally funny. He did everything with his sense of humor. I'll miss him so much. He was a special person. He didn't wear glasses, but if he did, they would be rose-colored glasses."
Craig Wolfley is survived by his wife, Faith, and daughters Megan, Hannah, and Esther, and sons, Kyle, "CJ", and "Max." (Teresa Varley contributed to this story.)

5 for Friday: Steelers hope QB first piece of the puzzle
Contributing Writer/Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - In the next two weeks, the Steelers hope to figure out their situation at quarterback.
General Manager Omar Khan said earlier this week here in Indianapolis at the NFL Scouting Combine that the team has had talks with the representatives for both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields in the hopes of getting one of the duo signed to a contract for the 2025 season before the opening bell of free agency March 12.
There's good reason for that.
Determining who will be at quarterback will determine what direction the team will go in the draft and free agency because the Steelers will want to build the best roster around that quarterback to be able to put the best product on the field as possible in 2025.
"I think we have some very talented people on the roster, and I think we will add some more talented people, and I think we have a chance," Khan said this week. "I really do."
That's not pie-in-the-sky thinking.
After all, the Steelers were 10-3 at one point in 2024. They were in first place in the AFC North until a four-game losing streak against some of the best teams in the league doomed them to a second-place finish and going on the road in the postseason.
It wasn't a pretty finish and nobody is happy or content with it. Nor should they be.
"We ended the season last year with five-straight losses, and that's unacceptable," Khan said. "We've got to be better. We have to be self-aware, and we have got to look ourselves in the mirror. And that goes for players, coaches and the entire organization from top to bottom. We've got to ask ourselves what went wrong and why? And how do we fix it? How do we make sure it doesn't happen again? And we have to get better."
You do that by adding talent, not subtracting it.
And the Steelers are in a position to do so, not only in the upcoming NFL Draft in April, but in free agency, as well.
Per Overthecap.com, the Steelers have approximately $60 million in available cap space. This is not a roster that will be shedding players to clear cap space in 2025. If the Steelers release a player, it's because he doesn't fit into the long-term plans, not because they have to do so to become cap compliant.
That hasn't always been the case as the team has been forced in the past to make some difficult decisions regarding its roster due to tightness with the salary cap.
So, while the Steelers were, in fact, not good enough in 2024 to compete for a championship, there is a belief that if they can continue building the roster, they can get there.
"At the end of the day, the goal is to acquire as many good players as possible at every position group," Khan said. "And that's the approach we take, and that's going to continue."
• The Steelers' wide receivers not named George Pickens or Calvin Austin III combined to catch 43 passes in 2024, obviously a total that isn't good enough.
That's why the Steelers appear set to address the position with a veteran addition or two in free agency this offseason.
It's also why the team would like to have a quarterback signed sooner rather than later.
"It is an ideal scenario where you'd like to have this done before the start of the league year," Khan said. "Obviously, who you sign impacts the type of receiver you know you may go after, or how you build the rest of the team. So, all of that has an effect."
There are a number of veteran options that will be available when free agency begins March 12. And Khan expects to be active in the free agent market this offseason.
"We just weren't good enough. You've got to score more," Khan said. "The reality is, you've got to score a lot of points in the league in 2025 football. You've got to score a lot of points, and we didn't score enough points. And there's a lot of reasons for that, and we've just got to be better."
One thing the Steelers weren't unhappy with was the job offensive coordinator Arthur Smith did. After averaging 17.9 points per game in 2023, they improved to 22.2 points per game in 2024. That was 16th in the NFL, one spot behind Kansas City.
"Arthur did a really good job," Khan said. "I like Arthur a lot, and we work well together. We have to resolve the quarterback situation, and once we get that resolved, we'll do our best to help surround that person with the right pieces to make Arthur's job a lot easier."
• The NFL is considering changing the rules of overtime in the regular season.
From 2017 to 2024, teams that won the opening coin toss of overtime won the game 56.8 percent of the time. That was up from 55.4 percent from 2001 through 2016.
• Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Pittonline@iheartmedia.com
Currently, if the team that wins the opening toss scores a touchdown on its opening possession, the game is over.
If that team kicks a field goal on the opening possession, the opposing team gets an opportunity to score itself.
But with the reduction of the overtime period to 10 minutes, a greater emphasis was placed on winning the coin toss to begin the extra period, largely because if the team that wins the toss goes on an extended possession, the team that loses the coin toss is left with little time remaining.
In the postseason, both teams get an opportunity to get the ball, even if a touchdown is scored on the opening possession.
Making the regular season rules coincide with what is done in the postseason is a possible solution, as is having the extra period go back to being 15 minutes in length instead of 10.
• The league also is looking at using its Hawk-Eye virtual measuring system to determine first downs rather than having officials measure it with the chain gangs on the field.
Finally.
Chain gangs would continue to be used on the sidelines as a backup, but the technology available would immediately inform officials on the field if a first down was achieved.
"We used this in the background last season, Kimberly Fields, NFL senior vice president of football operations said this week in Indianapolis. "The goal for 2025 is to continue to train our techs, who are the ones who will be utilizing the technology, finalizing all of our officiating processes and procedures around virtual measurements and testing the graphics for the broadcast and in-stadium, so fans in the stadium and watching on television can see what we're doing."
On-field officials will still spot the ball as before, but the Hawk-Eye cameras can be used to adjust the spot.
• The NFL informed teams this week that the 2025 salary cap will be set at $279.2 million.
That's an increase of nearly $24 million from 2024.
It also means the salary cap has gone up $100 million from 2018, when the cap was $177 million.
It's also a long way from where the league started in 1994, its first season with a cap in place. That year, the salary cap for all teams was $34.6 million.

CONTENT:
In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today we look at the career of Assistant Head Coach John Mitchell, who was the first black player, captain, All-American and assistant coach at the University of Alabama.
Like many young kids growing up in Mobile, Alabama, John Mitchell dreamt about going to the University of Alabama.
But like so many young kids growing up in his Mobile neighborhood, at the time that he did, he knew that it was most likely nothing more than that – a dream.
Mitchell was born in 1951, a time when there was segregation in Alabama and throughout the South. And it wasn't just in the schools where it was felt, it was everyday life where blacks and whites were separated, and he had to deal with every aspect of it.
"It was pretty tough as a kid growing up, especially right there in Mobile and the state of Alabama," said Mitchell. "People talk now about confederate flags, at that time they were everywhere, in the stores, shopping centers. If they had a confederate flag in the window or outside the door, that was a sign that people of color were not welcome. At that time schools were segregated. There were black schools and white schools. Transportation was segregated. Black people would pay the same as white people but had to sit at the back of the bus. If they bus was crowded, they had to get up and give their seat to a white person. They had separate restaurants, shopping. Black people, if you went to the movies, you had to go through the back door to go in and then they couldn't sit in the front of the theater, they had to sit in the balcony."
Mitchell often wondered why. Why was there such a divide, a divide highlighted by those who lived on the other side of the railroad track.
"I asked my parents (John Sr. and Alice Mitchell) questions," said Mitchell. "They told me black people were treated a lot different than white people. You had to be aware of your surroundings and the things you did. Right there in Mobile, where I went to high school, there is a railroad track that goes right through the city. When I went to the other side of that track, if I was there after 6 o'clock, black people were arrested for trespassing because they were in a white neighborhood and most of the time, they said you had no business there.
"My parents were cognizant of me not being where I shouldn't be at certain hours of the night. When I would go out as a young guy, dating in high school, they told me places I could go, places I shouldn't go. They would stay awake until I got home to make sure I was okay, that I came back the same way I left. There were a lot of things back then that were really, really tough for African Americans, especially in the state of Alabama, especially in Mobile where I grew up."
But there was one love Mitchell always had, and race didn't impact it. He loved Alabama football. He would watch games on television with his family, or listen on the radio, and dream about the opportunity to go to Alabama and possibly play football one day for legendary coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant.
Then, he witnessed what so many others did. On June 11, 1963, two black students, Vivian Malone and James A. Hood, showed up at to register at Alabama. Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway and blocked them from entering. Despite federal agents trying to intervene, Wallace didn't budge, and President John F. Kennedy ordered the Alabama National Guard to assist. Eventually Wallace gave in and allowed them to register.
"I can remember as a young kid when Governor Wallace stood in the doorway at the University of Alabama, not going to admit Vivian Malone and James Hood to the University," recalled Mitchell. "Growing up as a young kid in Alabama in the 1950s and 60s, I saw a lot of things."
Despite what he saw, he never gave up. Many would have just accepted what was in front of them. But Mitchell wasn't one to accept anything less than what others had.
"I just knew that if I wanted what they had, I have to do what they are doing, which was get a good education, find a way to have a job that would be in demand whether I was black, brown or whatever," said Mitchell. "There weren't any big houses, or front yards, or nice cars in my neighborhood. I saw that on the other side of the tracks. That is what I wanted when I grew up. My parents told me the way to get it when I grow up is to get a good education because that is the only way you are going to get it.
"There were no doctors, lawyers, bankers, engineers in my neighborhood. They were common people with less than a high school education. I grew up in a blue-collar area. Very modest.
"The school I went to was segregated so I didn't have a white teacher until I went to college. When they came out with new books and materials, those went to the white schools. We would get the old books that were torn up, written in, cut out. I knew the education I got, by the time I got to college was inferior of what the white kids got in the same area I lived that went to all white schools. But I had to find a way."
While at Williamson High School, Mitchell and four of his black classmates won an area science fair, then a state science fair, and then finished third in the country in a nationwide science fair. All five students were offered scholarships to Alabama or Auburn, but there was still a hurdle for Mitchell to overcome.
"All of us were offered scholarships to study engineering at the Southeastern Conference schools and all of the white schools in the South because that had never been done before," said Mitchell. "I could have gone to Alabama or another white school, but I wanted to play football and Alabama wasn't recruiting black players then."
So instead of taking advantage of the scholarship, and staying home and going to Alabama, Mitchell enrolled at Eastern Arizona Junior College to play football, where he received a scholarship. He earned Junior College All-American honors, and caught the attention of University of Southern California, committing to play for Coach John McKay.
That never happened.
Instead, his childhood dream came true.
"Coach Bryant was visiting Coach McKay at USC, speaking at his clinic, and Coach McKay was bragging that he had a black kid from Mobile who was coming to Southern Cal," explained Mitchell of how it all played out. "Alabama never saw me play. Alabama had recruiters in the state. They called every John Mitchell in the phone book until they got my dad.
"They wanted to know if I was the John Mitchell who accepted the scholarship. Two days later Coach Bryant had a couple of coaches in my mother's home to visit with us to see if I wanted to go to Alabama. Two of his assistants visited, Pat Dye was one of them."
For the Mitchells, or anyone living in that neighborhood, having white visitors wasn't normal.
"A white person wouldn't have any reason to come there unless they were looking for someone to do some work for them, cut the grass, things like that," said Mitchell. "They didn't cross the railroad track either. We didn't have a lot of white visitors for any reason I can think of. That just didn't happen. That track separated the haves from the have nots. That is just the way it was.
"But they came to my house. I visited with them and a week later I took an official visit to Alabama, met Coach Bryant, my mom, my dad and myself.
"I wanted my family to see me play. The biggest thrill I had in high school was walking out of the locker room and seeing the face of my mom, dad and brother and sister. I never had that opportunity in junior college in Arizona. I knew if I went to Southern Cal, they would only have it once or twice. But if I went to Alabama, they could see me play all of the time. It was a 3½ hour drive, and they could drive there and some of the other games in the SEC. When I went and visited, Coach Bryant sold me on going to Alabama. I wanted to go there. They won a lot of National Championships when I was growing up. As a kid you knew Coach Bryant. Everybody knew Alabama football."
With all of the excitement, also came a challenge.
John Mitchell was now the first black player to play for the Alabama Crimson Tide.
How he would be accepted, even if he would be accepted, by his teammates of course was on his mind. As was so much more.
"The thing that eased my mind, and I can remember it like yesterday, is we sat in Coach Bryant's office and he said if your son comes here, he is going to have some problems," said Mitchell. "The only thing I ask of him is if he does have a problem, come see me first before he goes to the press. That is all I want. I want him to see me first. I will handle it. My mom and dad were impressed with that.
"When I was there, I never had a problem. I had a white roommate, Bobby Stanford from Albany, Georgia. He came from an upper middle-class family. He was a real good guy. His family were good people. When they came to visit, whatever they brought for Bobby, they would bring me. They would hug me goodbye. His parents were great. They knew no color. He was in my wedding. We have been friends for 50 years. We talk about twice a week now."
While his teammates were accepting of him, especially it being the first time the majority of them ever had a black teammate, when they went on the road, things were different. Many opposing players didn't hesitate to call Mitchell names, but he was always the bigger man.
"When we played in Mississippi, I was called a lot of 'good names,'" said Mitchell. "When I was at Alabama, schools like Auburn, LSU, Mississippi State, Ole Miss, Georgia didn't have any black athletes. The only people that had black athletes were Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Florida and Kentucky. When we played at the other schools, I was called some names. But I had a bunch of great teammates.
"There were a lot of white kids who never sat in a classroom or competed with an African American on their team. To see me put on a Crimson Tide uniform, that was the first time they had been that close to a black player. All the players I played with, they were so afraid of Coach Bryant, I didn't have to worry about it."
Putting on the Crimson Tide uniform. As a kid, he envisioned himself doing that. But he also knew what the reality was. He never imagined, a young kid from the other side of the railroad tracks would make history and be the first black player to wear the uniform.
"It brought tears to my eyes," said Mitchell of the first time he put it on. "I watched Alabama play on television or listened to on the radio. Coach Bryant was a household name. He was revered in the state of Alabama. In the back of my mind, I didn't know if I could play for Alabama, if I was good enough. I took a chance. I wanted to go and know if I could compete. I didn't know if I could compete against them."
Oh, he could compete alright. Mitchell became the first black captain and All-American at Alabama, not just breaking the barriers, but shattering them.
"Coach Bryant every week would name a captain for the next game if they played well, and at the end of the season, vote for the permanent captains," recalled Mitchell. "At this time, there were four black players on the team and there was a meeting to vote on captains. I didn't go to the meeting the day they voted, with me thinking I would never get voted.
"I was coming back to the dorm that day and one of the white players said you were elected captain. An hour later my position coach told me I better get over to the Athletic Department because Coach wanted to see me. I went in there, and I can't tell you what he said, but after he chewed me out for not being at the meeting, he told me he was proud of me and I deserved it. He was very pleased and excited I got elected captain.
"Coach Bryant treated me like a son. Besides my father he was a guy I looked up to and respected. He was fair. He loved his players. He didn't care if they were black or white. The only thing he wanted you to do was represent yourself and the university well and have class."
What is amazing in Mitchell's case, is things didn't stop when his playing days at Alabama ended. He continued to break down doors, becoming the first black coach in Alabama history, when he was hired as the team's defensive ends coach right out of college.
"I wanted to go to graduate school, law school, and I called Coach Bryant," said Mitchell. "I graduated six months ahead of my class, taking graduate classes to go to graduate school. I called him and told him I wanted to go to graduate school but I didn't have the money and wanted to talk to him about a job around the Athletic Department, anything I could do to earn money and go to school. I was at home and he told me to come see him when I got back to school.
"I can remember it like it was yesterday. Coach Bryant had a nice big office. He was at this desk with his glasses on his nose, and he never looked at me. He said if I offer you a full-time job on my staff, would you take it? I am 20 years old and I just got through playing for him six months ago and I am standing there, and he is not looking at me. And he says again. If I offer you this job will you take the job? I said yes sir. He then told me get out of here and go to work. I walked out of the office and said he never looked at me and offered me the job.
"He groomed me to be a football coach. Everything I do as a coach came from him. When I was on his staff, I had the chance to ask him a lot of questions that as a player you wouldn't ask. He taught me how to become a coach. Everything I do right now came from Coach Bryant. Everything. My players I coached here know because I talked to them about him."
During his time at Alabama, Mitchell never really thought about breaking the barriers. And honestly, it's not something he thinks about now. He doesn't look at himself as someone special.
"I tell people this, being first doesn't mean anything unless you do something with it," said Mitchell. "I am happy that people recognize I tried to do what was right and made the path a little easier for them. That is the thing I am happiest about. A lot of times you get to be first, if you don't take advantage of it, not only are you disappointing yourself, you are disappointing people who want to come after you. I have had a lot of guys say you made it easier to come after you.
"That is the thing that I am proudest of. Not that I was the first African American to play, be a captain or coach. Those things are fleeting. But when people say you made it easier for me, that is where my joy comes from.
"When I was at Alabama, we had about 10,500 students and only 50 black students. Only four out of 144 black guys in the athletic dorm were black, two football players and two basketball players. It was tough, but I made friends with a lot of guys who wanted to be friends. Not everybody was happy I was there. But there were some I was close to and still am.
"When I went to class, most of them I was the only black student in them. When I went to class every day, I had to be prepared. I didn't want to sit in the classroom and be the only black person and the professor call on me and I say I am not prepared. I stayed up late at night to make sure I was prepared for class the next day. I would never let the white students say I wasn't smart or not prepared. I never wanted that to happen to me. I burnt a lot of midnight oil to make sure I was prepared. I would never let a professor call on me and say not prepared."
Mitchell still has a home in the Mobile area. He goes back every offseason and spends time there, enjoying the place he will forever call home.
But things are different now. Instead of crossing the railroad track to get to his house, he goes through a gate. Yes, the man who grew up on the other side of the tracks, now lives in a gated community.
"It's much different now," said Mitchell. "Twenty years ago, I couldn't live in that neighborhood. It makes me feel good things have changed, and some things haven't changed. When I have to tell someone where I live, their eyes open up and they know I couldn't have stayed in that neighborhood 20 years ago because black people weren't able to."
While he has changed neighborhoods, he certainly hasn't forgotten where he came from. When he goes home, Mitchell crosses the tracks and goes back to where it all started for him.
"I do, and I do it for a reason," said Mitchell. "My dad had a seventh-grade education coming out. He was the oldest of 12. He had to drop out of school and go to the Army to help his family. My mom had a ninth-grade education. She had to drop out to help. Every time I cross that track, I think about how hard my mom and dad worked to make sure our family, there were five kids, we had a chance to get an education. The others in my family all have advanced degrees. It brings tears to my eyes that my parents didn't live long enough to see the success I had."

Rookie Recap: Zach Frazier
Steelers.com
For Zach Frazier, the past year was special, to say the least.
Frazier was drafted by the Steelers in the second-round of the 2024 NFL Draft, the 51st overall pick.
For someone who played at West Virginia University, and grew up in Fairmont, West Virginia, just over 90 minutes from Pittsburgh, it was the perfect scenario.
And it wasn't just the perfect scenario for Frazier.
It was for the Steelers offense as well.
Frazier quickly became a staple on the Steelers offensive line, taking over as the starting center Week 1 after Nate Herbig suffered a season-ending injury at the end of training camp.
"My mentality was always that I wanted to prepare to be the starter," said Frazier. "That was always my goal. To earn that spot. It was unfortunate that Nate got hurt because he had helped me out a ton and really helped get me through it.
"But my mentality is I always want to play, and I never want to just sit on the bench for a season. I want to be out there helping the team however I can. I feel like that's what I've done even in high school and college. I never wanted to redshirt. I wanted to play.
"So, when the opportunity came, I was ready for that. I was already ready with that mentally."
Frazier started all 15 games he appeared in during the 2024 season, missing two games with an ankle injury. He also started the Steelers Wild Card game.
He was selected to the Pro Football Writers of America All-Rookie team, the first Steelers offensive lineman to earn the honor since Maurkice Pouncey was selected to it in 2010.
He was voted the winner of the Joe Greene Great Performance Award, presented to the team's top rookie by the Pittsburgh Chapter of the Pro Football Writers of America.
Many have sung Frazier's praises throughout the season, but he isn't one who likes to talk about himself and what he accomplished.
"Obviously, I wasn't happy with how we finished as a team," said Frazier. "That was disappointing. Individually, I don't like to talk about myself. I thought I played hard and gave everything I had. I was happy with how I played.
"I feel like my rookie year flew by. I feel like we were just in Latrobe and now the season is over, and I am moving on to Year 2.
"I learned a lot, there was a big jump from college to the NFL, just as far as learning the playbook, getting used to that. For me, it was just getting the playbook down, getting all the calls down. When I first learned it, I had to think everything through. I felt like I was kind of playing slow at first, in OTAs and stuff. If you're out there thinking, then you're not playing fast. And really the key is to play fast. If you do make mistakes, make them at full speed. Once you're playing freely, you don't have to think as much and you're playing fast and everything just kind of falls into place.
"Once I had that down, it was back to playing football again."
Frazier was the point man for the offensive line, making the calls and keeping the unit together.
Not an easy job for a rookie, but this is a guy who doesn't shy away from a challenge.
"There's a lot of responsibility," said Frazier. "Everyone's looking at you to make the calls. There's a lot of work that goes into it throughout the week, a lot of studying and a lot of meetings with the coaches. It's something I take pride in."
Frazier plans on not wasting a lot of time this offseason, jumping into watching film cutups of his plays from the season. He is doing it to grow from the things he did well and improve in areas where he feels it's necessary.
"I'm going to watch all the film again," said Frazier. "I'm going to make cutups of some bad plays and good plays and see what I want to get off my tape and what I want to keep and sustain.
"That's something I've kind of done throughout college. I'm going to keep that going and focus on what I need to fix."
