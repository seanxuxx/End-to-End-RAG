Many of our Paramedics have also obtained certification through the National Registry of EMTs gaining them certification as a Nationally Registered Paramedic. New Paramedics and EMTs are also instructed through a joint effort between Pittsburgh EMS and the Center for Emergency Medicine. Training to become a Paramedic requires thousands of hours of preparation, dedication and hard work. Paramedics are constantly updating themselves and the equipment and skills required to perform at their best. It is the role of the Training Division to keep the Paramedics prepared for whatever they may encounter. Paramedics of Pittsburgh EMS continue their education and maintaining certification by attending a minimum of 24 hours of continuing education classes each year. To ensure that every Paramedic receives annual training, the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services developed the EMS Training Division to handle the task of education. The division consists of three Paramedic Crew Chiefs assigned as training officers to handle the workload. In addition, other field personnel with specialized training are brought into the Division as needed to assist in training subjects that are not part of everyday, routine operations. There are also many Paramedic Crew Chiefs trained as Field Training Officers to assist in the hands-on training that is given to many Paramedic students, emergency physician residents, RNs and so on. Many of our Paramedics are certified as instructors and evaluators in a wide range of related Public Safety disciplines. These include Emergency Medicine, Rescue, Hazardous Materials and more. These Pittsburgh Paramedics routinely share their knowledge and skills with responders from throughout Pennsylvania and, indeed, the entire nation. Many of our personnel are among the most sought after technical instructors in their fields of expertise. The Training Division also provides a range of educational opportunities to other City bureaus and departments as well as the public at large. The Training Division assists in facilitating CPR/AED (automatic external defibrillator) classes for other City of Pittsburgh departments and neighborhood groups. The Training Division also teaches the First Responder program for all of the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers and recruits. City of Pittsburgh Paramedics receive their medical direction/command through the Center for Emergency Medicine and work under the guidance of our Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth. We also share a unique relationship with the University of Pittsburgh's affiliated Residency in Emergency Medicine which, on select calls, allows for an emergency physician to respond to the scene of an emergency.

        "<Retrived>context": [
            "EVENT HIGHLIGHTS. International Food FairAt the heart of One Big Table is a sprawling international food fair presented by restaurants from our local neighborhoods, where chefs, culinary artists, and food enthusiasts come together to prepare and present a world-class selection of global cuisines from local restaurants. Many of the featured restaurants are immigrant-owned. Attendees can embark on a culinary journey, savoring dishes from every corner of the world, spicy Thai curries, flavorful Mexican empanadas, delicate French pastries, flaky Indian samosas, and so much more. The food fair offers a unique opportunity to taste, learn, and appreciate different culinary traditions. Entertainment ExtravaganzaThe event is a feast not just for the palate but for all the senses, featuring an array of live performances that represent diverse cultures and talents from across the globe. Attendees can expect to be mesmerized by traditional dances, live music, and much more. Each performance adds to the vibrancy of the event, creating a unique atmosphere of celebration and unity. Global MarketplaceFor those looking to take a piece of the world home, a global marketplace features unique products, souvenirs, and international handicrafts. It's a great opportunity to shop for one-of-a-kind items from around the globe. Some of the artists selected to participate may have benefited from Literacy Pittsburgh programming themselves. WHO BENEFITS. Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job. Proceeds from One Big Table provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness. April 3, 2025.",

The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division . Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants , nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente , the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame , and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell . Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012 , a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues. [ 5 ] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League, [ 6 ] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839\u201310,819\u2013140 (.500 winning 'percentage'). [ 7 ] The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park , a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins . History [ edit ] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club , an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City , across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. [ 8 ] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, [ 9 ] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association . Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, [ 10 ] the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. [ 11 ] Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League 's Pittsburgh Burghers . The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer , who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics . Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\". [ 12 ] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. [ 13 ] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. The 1909 Pirates in a poster celebrating their National League pennant. Frank Chance of Chicago and John McGraw of  New York, two teams the Pirates beat for the pennant, are being made to walk the plank . After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels , who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.) [ 14 ] Among those players was Honus Wagner , who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played , which they lost to Boston . The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909 , defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming",

College\n\nPower 5\n\nOther\n\nBaseball\n\n[t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball ... The best stadium in baseball is in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise, having been founded in 1881, and plays in the Central Division of the National League. The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[205]\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990\u201392) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014\u20132015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[206]\n\nFootball\n\nThe city's professional team, NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, is named after the distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[207] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[208] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. College football in the city dates to 1889[209] with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships, qualifying 37 total bowl games, appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, and winning the 2021 ACC Championship Game which was the program's first conference title since leaving the Big East for the ACC between the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[210] Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Acrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[211] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier. Hockey\n\nThe NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's founding in 1967. The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance \"The Igloo\".[212]\n\nIce hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213]\n\nThe NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936\u20131967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[214] Pro-grade ice rinks in the region include the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe. Basketball\n\nProfessional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937\u201345 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947\u201348 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961\u201363), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970\u201372), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004\u201308) and Phantoms (2009\u201310) both of the ABA. Three Pittsburgh universities, the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and Robert Morris University, compete in NCAA Division I basketball. Pitt and Duquesne are the traditional basketball powers in the city, but all three universities have made multiple appearances in the National Invitation Tournament and NCAA tournament. Pitt won two pre-NCAA tournament National Championships in 1928 and 1930[215] while Duquesne won the NIT title in 1955, its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Both Pitt and Duquesne have reached the NCAA tournament Final Four once, Duquesne in 1940 and Pitt in 1941. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. Soccer\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Riverhounds play their home games at Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[citation needed]\n\nGolf\n\nGolf has deep roots in the area. The oldest U.S. course in continuous use, Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887 calls the region home.[216] Suburban Oakmont Country Club holds the record for most times as host for the U.S. Open at nine; it has also hosted the U.S. Women's Open, PGA Championships, and U.S. Amateurs.[217]"

Many of our Paramedics have also obtained certification through the National Registry of EMTs gaining them certification as a Nationally Registered Paramedic. New Paramedics and EMTs are also instructed through a joint effort between Pittsburgh EMS and the Center for Emergency Medicine. Training to become a Paramedic requires thousands of hours of preparation, dedication and hard work. Paramedics are constantly updating themselves and the equipment and skills required to perform at their best. It is the role of the Training Division to keep the Paramedics prepared for whatever they may encounter. Paramedics of Pittsburgh EMS continue their education and maintaining certification by attending a minimum of 24 hours of continuing education classes each year. To ensure that every Paramedic receives annual training, the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services developed the EMS Training Division to handle the task of education. The division consists of three Paramedic Crew Chiefs assigned as training officers to handle the workload. In addition, other field personnel with specialized training are brought into the Division as needed to assist in training subjects that are not part of everyday, routine operations. There are also many Paramedic Crew Chiefs trained as Field Training Officers to assist in the hands-on training that is given to many Paramedic students, emergency physician residents, RNs and so on. Many of our Paramedics are certified as instructors and evaluators in a wide range of related Public Safety disciplines. These include Emergency Medicine, Rescue, Hazardous Materials and more. These Pittsburgh Paramedics routinely share their knowledge and skills with responders from throughout Pennsylvania and, indeed, the entire nation. Many of our personnel are among the most sought after technical instructors in their fields of expertise. The Training Division also provides a range of educational opportunities to other City bureaus and departments as well as the public at large. The Training Division assists in facilitating CPR/AED (automatic external defibrillator) classes for other City of Pittsburgh departments and neighborhood groups. The Training Division also teaches the First Responder program for all of the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers and recruits. City of Pittsburgh Paramedics receive their medical direction/command through the Center for Emergency Medicine and work under the guidance of our Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth. We also share a unique relationship with the University of Pittsburgh's affiliated Residency in Emergency Medicine which, on select calls, allows for an emergency physician to respond to the scene of an emergency.

            "URL: https://www.steelers.com/team/coaches-roster/teryl-austin\n\nCONTENT:\n\nTeryl Austin\n\nDefensive Coordinator\n\nCollege: University of Pittsburgh\n\nExperience: 20 years\n\nBiography\n\nTeryl Austin is in his second season as the Steelers' defensive coordinator. He was promoted after three seasons as the Steelers' senior defensive assistant/secondary coach on February 6, 2022. This marks his 20th year in the National Football League coaching ranks. Under the guidance of Austin, Pittsburgh improved from ranking 29th in opponent yards per game to the stingiest defense in the League over the second half of the 2022 season, allowing an NFL-best 272.9 yards per game following their bye week. The Steelers defense also improved in getting off the field through the last nine weeks, allowing the third-least third-down conversions (36) and tying for the second-most interceptions (12). The team's 20 interceptions on the season tied for the most in the League. In 2021, six different Steelers' defensive backs were responsible for interceptions, while five forced at least one fumble. Pro Bowl safety Minkah Fitzpatrick led the team with 124 tackles on the season. Austin coached a group of defensive backs that helped Pittsburgh's defense rank as one of the NFL's best in 2020. The Steelers limited 11 opponents below a 60.0 completion percentage, which led all teams for the season. Pittsburgh's opponents averaged a 56.7 completion percentage and a 76.7 average quarterback ranking. Both marks not only led the NFL but were the lowest by a Pittsburgh defense since 2011. The Steelers also finished near the top of the League in interceptions (t-1st, 18), takeaways (2nd, 27), games with multiple takeaways (1st, 11) and passes defensed (1st, 84). Fitzpatrick was named both a Pro-Bowler and AP All-Pro for the second season in a row. Fitzpatrick had five takeaways (four interceptions and one fumble recovery), which ranked sixth in the NFL. In 2019, Pittsburgh ranked top-five in the NFL in interceptions (2nd, 20), interception rate (2nd, 3.89%), pass defense (3rd, 194.6), yards per play allowed (3rd, 4.72), passes defensed (3rd, 99), opposing passer rating (4th, 79.7), pass yards per attempt allowed (4th, 6.06), total defense (5th, 304.1) and scoring defense (5th, 18.9). Fitzpatrick, who was named All-Pro, had five interceptions, two forced fumble and three fumble recoveries in 2019. His eight total takeaways (interceptions and fumble recoveries) led the NFL. He recorded defensive TDs in back-to-back games, including a 96-yard interception return for a TD against the Colts (Nov. 3) and a 43-yard fumble return for TD against the Rams (Nov. 10). Cornerback Joe Haden recorded 65 tackles, 17 passes defensed, five interceptions, three tackles for loss, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery in 2019. Haden ranked tied for fourth in the NFL in passes defensed, interceptions and total takeaways (five interceptions, one fumble recovery). Prior to his time in Pittsburgh, Austin served as defensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions (2014-17), before a one-year stint in the same role with the Cincinnati Bengals (2018). As defensive coordinator for the Lions (2014-17), Austin's defensive units ranked in the Top-10 among all NFL teams in total yards per game allowed (340.3/10th), rushing yards per game allowed (100.3/8th) and the number of games in which opponents were held to 20 points or less (34/tied for 6th). In 2017, the Lions finished third in the NFL with 32 takeaways, tied for second in fumble recoveries (13) and tied for fifth with a +10 turnover differential. In 2016, Austin's defensive squad helped the team advance to the playoffs as the unit tied for second in the NFL by holding opposing offenses to 21 points or less in 10 games. In 2014, his first season as an NFL defensive coordinator, Austin coordinated one of the League's most dominant defenses, finishing first in rush defense (69.3 yards per game), second in total defense (300.9 yards per game) and third in scoring defense (17.6 points per game). Prior to his time with Detroit, Austin served as a defensive backs coach for a combined 10 years with three NFL teams: Seattle Seahawks (2003-06), Arizona Cardinals (2007-09) and Baltimore Ravens (2011-13). In each of his three stops as a position coach, Austin helped lead his team to Super Bowl appearances (Seattle in 2005 and Arizona in 2008), while securing a 2012 Championship with Baltimore. From 2011-13, Austin served as the secondary coach of the Ravens, developing the secondary into an integral part of one of the NFL's most consistent defenses in recent years. In 2012, Austin's secondary helped advance the Ravens to its Super Bowl XLVII Championship run. In his first season with Baltimore, in 2011, the Ravens yielded a league-low 11 passing TDs and surrendered the third-fewest points per game (16.6), tying an NFL record by ranking in the top three in points allowed for the fourth consecutive campaign. In 2010, Austin served at the helm of the University of Florida's defense, which recorded 22 interceptions \u2014 the fourth-most in the nation \u2014 returning four for TDs. The Gators' 538 interception return yards were the most in the nation. Austin's unit led the SEC in conference games, allowing just 310.8 yards per game, including 175.5 passing. Three of Austin's defensive backs with the Arizona Cardinals earned Pro Bowl honors in 2009: CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, S Antrel Rolle and S Adrian Wilson. Austin helped guide Rodgers-Cromartie, the team's first-round pick in 2008, to a team-best four interceptions in the regular season and two during the playoffs. In 2007, the Cardinals led the League with six interceptions returned for TDs and 551 interception return yards. Austin played a key role in the development of the Seahawks' young secondary during his 2003-06 tenure in Seattle. Seattle's defense produced 67 interceptions over Austin's four-year span, tying for the 10th-most in the NFL from 2003-07. Austin's college coaching career began as a graduate assistant at Penn State (1991-92). He held stints as the defensive backs coach at Wake Forest (1993-95), Syracuse (1996-98) and Michigan (1999-2002). Austin was a three-year starter and four-year letterman at safety for the University of Pittsburgh from 1983-87. He earned a bachelor's degree in communications from Pittsburgh in 1988. Austin played for the Montreal Machine of the World League of American Football in 1991, after attending training camps with the Washington Football Team and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (CFL). Austin, a native of Sharon, Pa., attended Sharon (Pa.) High School. He and his wife, April, have five children, including sons Tyler, Trey and Torin, and daughters Alexa and Alivia.

On May 8, 1886, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys turned the first 3\u20134\u20132 triple play in Major League history. [ 83 ] In the fourth inning of a game, the Cincinnati Red Stockings put runners in first and second with no outs. John Reilly grounded out to first base, where Fred Carroll recorded the first out. He threw to second base, where Sam Barkley made the tag for the second out. The runner from second decided to try for home plate and he was cut down on a throw from Barkley and a tag by Doggie Miller . [ citation needed ] The Alleghenys won the game, 9\u20136. [ 84 ] First ever Major League Baseball game broadcast on the radio, a game between the Pirates and the host Philadelphia Phillies aired August 5, 1921, on KDKA (AM) Pittsburgh. The Pirates won the game, 8\u20135. In 1925 , the Pirates became the first MLB team to recover from a 3-games-to-1 deficit in winning a best-of-seven World Series; they then became the first MLB team to repeat that feat in 1979 . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] During the 1953 season, the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass \" miner's cap \". This was the mandate of general manager Branch Rickey , who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game. [ 87 ] In 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a helmet with the comfort of a baseball cap. [ 88 ] The cap would prove widely unpopular, with only Alex Torres of the New York Mets choosing to wear it. [ 89 ] First franchise to win a World Series on a home run ( 1960 World Series ) in the 7th game. The only other team to accomplish this feat is the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993 , though theirs came in Game 6. In 1970 the Pirates became the first major league club to create their uniforms using a cotton-nylon blend featuring pull-over shirts and beltless pants. [ 90 ] The first all-minority lineup in MLB history took the field on September 1, 1971. [ 91 ] The lineup was Rennie Stennett , Gene Clines , Roberto Clemente , Willie Stargell , Manny Sanguill\u00e9n , Dave Cash , Al Oliver , Jackie Hern\u00e1ndez , and Dock Ellis . [ 92 ] The first World Series night game was played in Three Rivers Stadium on October 13, 1971\u2014 eleven years to the day since Mazeroski's walk-off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960 . In this case, however, it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, rather than a decisive Game 7. Apparently, good things happen for the Pirates on this date, as they knotted the 1971 World Series at two games apiece on their way to their fourth title. The first MLB scout to win the \"Scout of the Year Award\", Howie Haak , in 1984, three additional scouts from the organization have subsequently won the award. The first combined extra inning no-hitter in MLB history took place at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1997. Francisco C\u00f3rdova (9 innings) and Ricardo Rinc\u00f3n (1 inning) combined to no-hit the Houston Astros , 3\u20130 in 10 innings. Pinch-hitter Mark Smith's three-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning sealed the victory and the no-hitter for the Pirates. It remains the only such no-hitter to date. [ 93 ] In November 2008, the Pirates became the first MLB team to sign Indian players when they acquired the non-draft free agents of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel .

        "Question": "In what year did the production of steel begin in Pittsburgh?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "1875",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]\n\nGeography of industrialization\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]\n\nA further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]\n\nBy about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]\n\nMachine politics\n\nChristopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]\n\nGermans\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]\n\nLabor unions",
            "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J."

        "Question": "What is the name of the exhibit that features dinosaurs in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Dinosaurs in Their Time",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "\u201cThere are photos from the unveiling where there are people shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d says Lamanna. Back in Pittsburgh, big things were in the works. \u201cMultiple sources cite the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and Carnegie\u2019s desire to display its mounted skeleton as a major driving force behind the construction of an expanded Carnegie Institute building,\u201d says Lamanna. In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall. Diplodocus carnegii finally had a forever home. \u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d says Tom Rea, author of Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Dinosaur . The display of real fossils\u2014not just casts\u2014is what made it momentous, explains Rea. Before long, word of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus spread like wildfire. And everybody wanted a piece. Dippy\u2019s World Tour\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the largest and most respected museums in the world were only just beginning to catch dino-fever. \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing time in science when you think about it,\u201d says Rea. \u201cThese were all temples of science,\u201d adds Rea, who is also editor and founder of WyoHistory.org, a project of the Wyoming Historical Society. \u201cThese big halls, with high ceilings and dramatic arches, and daylight coming down through the clerestory, and all that stuff that makes these spaces so fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nBut most of them had nothing like a Diplodocus . So when requests started to pour in from abroad, Carnegie again seized the moment. Before long, casts would be sent to some of the largest cities in the world. According to Rea, Berlin erected its Diplodocus cast in March 1908. Paris followed suit that June. The following year, Vienna and Bologna joined the trend, and then St. Petersburg in 1910, La Plata, Argentina, in 1912, Madrid in 1913, and Mexico City in 1930. For the vast majority of museumgoers of the day, it would be the first dinosaur they\u2019d ever laid eyes upon. \u201cThe cool thing about that is, most of these casts are still on display,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cWhen you think about all the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people that see Diplodocus carnegii casts every year in all these European cities, in Latin [and South] America, and couple that with the fact that these mounts have been on display in many cases for more than a century,\u201d says Lamanna, \u201cthis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nThe House That Dippy Built\n\nNo one is quite sure who first coined \u201cDippy\u201d as the nickname for Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus . \u201cI can tell you that the fossil preparator Arthur Coggeshall used the nickname in three articles he wrote in Carnegie magazine about the discovery and fame of D. carnegii in September, October, and November 1951,\u201d says Rea. Coggeshall had been connected to the museum for more than half a century at that point. In fact, he was on the original expedition in Wyoming when Dippy was discovered. Nieuwland adds that Coggeshall\u2019s boss, Holland, referred to the Diplodocus as \u201cOld Dip,\u201d but not Dippy. The one thing we do know is that pretty much as soon as the casts of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus started stomping around the world, some scientists took issue with how the mount stood. This was due, in part, to a notion of the day that dinosaurs would have stood like modern-day lizards and crocodiles\u2014low to the ground, with tail in tow and legs sprawled widely apart. But Holland, who started his career as a butterfly expert before doubling as the museum\u2019s paleontologist, contended in 1910 that the legs of Diplodocus held the animal higher off the ground, more like a mammal. \u201cUltimately, Holland\u2019s argument was proven correct,\u201d says Lamanna, who cites the subsequent discovery of fossilized sauropod trackways showing that the feet were placed close together as the deciding factor. \u201cAnd now everyone that knows or cares at all about sauropods reconstructs them with their legs underneath their bodies, like an elephant.\u201d\n\nMore changes came over time\u2014and some of them quite recently. Lamanna arrived at the museum in 2004 and at the time, the tail of Diplodocus carnegii still lay upon the ground. Worse still, it nearly touched the feet of a T. rex , a dinosaur that humans are closer to in time than Diplodocus would have been. \u201cSo this was wrong on two levels,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cFirst of all, the dinosaur\u2019s tail probably didn\u2019t touch the ground very much, if at all. And secondly, having the tail lap against the ankles of a 66-million-year-old dinosaur \u2026 I mean, you might as well have had a caveman riding the T. rex .\u201d\n\nGetting Dippy\u2019s tail off the ground\u2014and away from T. rex \u2014was just one of many changes that went into the creation of the museum\u2019s Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition, which opened in 2008 in a space triple the size of the original Dinosaur Hall. Among other changes, Lamanna and his colleagues also switched the bones in Dippy\u2019s forelimbs and added vertebrae in its tail, in keeping with the latest research. Elsewhere in the exhibition, scientists, artists, and fossil preparators transformed formerly two-dimensional fossils into three-dimensional works of art, including Dryosaurus elderae, Camptosaurus aphanoecetes , and Corythosaurus casuarius . Similarly, real fossil heads of Edmontosaurus regalis and Triceratops prorsus received cast bodies, bringing them to life. And it\u2019s not just the mounts, says Lamanna. The team has also worked to surround the dinos with plants, rocks, smaller animals, and other facets of the ecosystems they would have once inhabited to create a more immersive visitor experience. Of the roughly 230 objects now on display in Dinosaurs in Their Time , about 75 percent are real fossils, not casts, making this one of the most impressive paleontological exhibitions on Earth. Dippy: Teacher And Celebrity\n\nOf course, in paleontology, there will always be questions we can\u2019t answer. For instance, scientists have yet to find a Diplodocus carnegii head, meaning the one sported by Dippy currently is a cast of a skull of the related species Diplodocus longus . And remember, Dippy is already a composite skeleton\u2014meaning it\u2019s made up of multiple specimens. Lamanna\u2014who has helped discover and name much larger sauropods known as titanosaurs\u2014says that Dippy was the bedrock on which so much future paleontology would be built. \u201c Diplodocus is one of our first windows into sauropod biology,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe appearance, behavior, lifestyle, evolutionary relationships; when we do research on sauropods today, in a lot of ways we\u2019re standing on the shoulders of the people that did research on Diplodocus back in the day, and also Diplodocus itself.\u201d\n\nThe museum has also fully embraced Dippy\u2019s celebrity\u2014placing the dino in its logo and stationing a full-bodied gelcoat and fiberglass replica outside on Forbes Avenue. These days, the outdoor Dippy may be the one that gets the most attention, on account of its ever-changing accessories.",
            "Early Dinosaur Hall\n\nThe Hall of Architecture\n\nAdding two new museums Carnegie Museums\u2019 second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries , which gave Carnegie Museum of Art\u2019s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls : Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as \u201cThe Carnegie,\u201d and to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. Home to Buhl Planetarium , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and hundreds of interactive science exhibits, the Science Center now attracts more than half a million people a year. By the time of its 10-year anniversary in 2001, the Science Center opened Highmark SportsWorks , the largest collection of sports and science exhibits in the world. Carnegie Science Center\n\nThree years later, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum . In addition to presenting the vast archives of Andy Warhol , the museum also has become a center for dialogue about a diverse range of topics, as well as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh\u2019s cultural richness and diversity through its many traveling exhibitions. The Andy Warhol Museum\n\nToday\u2019s ever-changing experiences By the year 2000, the four Carnegie Museums became known as \u201cCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.\u201d The following two decades included the debut of Carnegie Museum of Natural History\u2019s blockbuster Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibit, which is nearly three times the size of the original dinosaur hall and the first exhibit in the world to feature scientifically accurate, immersive environments spanning the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2003 and again in 2012, Carnegie Museum of Art accomplished its most important and most visitor-focused transformations since the opening of the Scaife wing with the reopening of its Scaife Galleries after year-long renovations, which included new presentations of its vast collections and the display of more artwork. In 2014, The Andy Warhol Museum rehung its collection, telling the story of Andy Warhol\u2019s life and artwork chronologically for the first time to spectacular effect. In 2017, Carnegie Museums launched a collaborative event series, Carnegie Nexus , that reaches across the arts and sciences to design experiences that animate pressing issues of our time and instigate new ways to examine our world through live performance, the visual and literary arts, and thoughtful conversation. And in 2018, Carnegie Science Center completed a major expansion: PPG Science Pavilion , which houses a suite of STEM Learning Labs; a Special Exhibitions Gallery for large-scale changing exhibitions; a laser digital giant-screen theater; and outdoor learning spaces on the riverfront.

Kamin Science Center , [ 2 ] [ needs update ] is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . It is located in the Chateau [ 3 ] neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium . Overview [ edit ] The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Giant Theater (promoted as \"the biggest screen in Pittsburgh\"), a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University \u2019s Robot Hall of Fame (in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema), [ 5 ] SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and the USS Requin (a World War II submarine ). Updates [ edit ] According to Nicholas Efran, \"The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years.\" However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are \"Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building\" [ 6 ] In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations . [ 7 ] In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 's Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the $10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs. [ 8 ] In June 2022, \u00a7\u00a0Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame , such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars , Maria from Metropolis , as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey , were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the \u00a7\u00a0SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid , the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center\u2019s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage \"until the Science Center decides what to do with it\". [ 5 ] [ 9 ] History [ edit ] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn ) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. [ 10 ] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991. [ 11 ] On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center [ 12 ] Roboworld (until 2022) [ edit ] Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022. [ 9 ] It was touted as \"the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition\", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring \"all things robotic\". [ 13 ] Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid , the Robothespian, an interactive , animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort. [ 14 ] The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2 , C-3PO , Data , the T-800 Terminator , R.O.B. , Maschinenmensch , Gort , Robby the Robot , Robot B-9 , HAL 9000 , and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running . Highmark SportsWorks [ edit ] Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks ) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. [ 15 ] The main idea of SportsWorks is \"to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports.\" [ 15 ] SportsWorks features three themed areas:  Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports). The previous sponsor, UPMC , ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100\u00a0m 2 ) SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark . It reopened in the Fall of 2009. [ 16 ] From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition . At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit. [ 17 ] A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit , then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector , an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh. [ 18 ] E-motion cone [ edit ] The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system. [ 19 ] In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs. [ 20 ] At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.

            "In 2020, she performed chamber music concerts in Taiwan alongside established musicians such as David Chan, Philip Setzer, Cho-Liang Lin, Scott Lee, and Dmitri Atapine. ================================================================================\n\nURL: https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/biographies/pso-conductors/honeck-manfred TITLE: Honeck Manfred CONTENT: Manfred Honeck Music Director Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world\u2019s leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the 2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY\u00ae nominations, and he and the orchestra won the GRAMMY\u00ae for \"Best Orchestral Performance\" in 2018. The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical acclaim. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven\u2019s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart\u2019s Idomeneo . Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites, including Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Jen\u016ffa , Strauss\u2019s Elektra , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Rusalka as well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss\u2019s Salome , was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Z\u00fcrich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty years. In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on the music of this composer. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him \"Artist of the Year\". Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.",
            "Tourangeau President & CEO Randi & L. Van V.

Tourangeau\u2019s personal and professional commitment to creating deep and meaningful connections between music, musicians and the community is a hallmark of her leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, one of America\u2019s most distinguished orchestras.

She successfully led negotiations for a new contract with members of the Orchestra. Tourangeau has represented the orchestra on several highly acclaimed domestic and international tours, enhancing the orchestra\u2019s international reputation. During her tenure, the orchestra\u2019s illustrious recording history has been underscored with numerous GRAMMY Awards and nominations, including the award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2018.

            "EVENT HIGHLIGHTS. International Food FairAt the heart of One Big Table is a sprawling international food fair presented by restaurants from our local neighborhoods, where chefs, culinary artists, and food enthusiasts come together to prepare and present a world-class selection of global cuisines from local restaurants. Many of the featured restaurants are immigrant-owned. Attendees can embark on a culinary journey, savoring dishes from every corner of the world, spicy Thai curries, flavorful Mexican empanadas, delicate French pastries, flaky Indian samosas, and so much more. The food fair offers a unique opportunity to taste, learn, and appreciate different culinary traditions. Entertainment ExtravaganzaThe event is a feast not just for the palate but for all the senses, featuring an array of live performances that represent diverse cultures and talents from across the globe. Attendees can expect to be mesmerized by traditional dances, live music, and much more. Each performance adds to the vibrancy of the event, creating a unique atmosphere of celebration and unity. Global MarketplaceFor those looking to take a piece of the world home, a global marketplace features unique products, souvenirs, and international handicrafts. It's a great opportunity to shop for one-of-a-kind items from around the globe. Some of the artists selected to participate may have benefited from Literacy Pittsburgh programming themselves. WHO BENEFITS. Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job. Proceeds from One Big Table provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness. April 3, 2025.",

            "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture\n\nOakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]\n\nNew immigrants and migrants\n\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city.

        "<Retrived>context": [
            "For a time, the Soviet-bloc countries were outcompeting their Western counterparts, but the major Western sporting nations began to create similar state-sponsored programs. Poorer nations, with the notable exception of Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba, were for the most part unable or unwilling to dedicate scarce economic resources to the athletic \u201carms race.\u201d As a result, they had difficulty competing on the world stage. Even after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, an international order persists in which nations can be grouped into core, semiperipheral, and peripheral blocs, not by geography but rather by politics, economics, and culture. The core of the sports world comprises the United States, Russia, western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Japan, South Korea, Cuba, China, Brazil, and several of the former Soviet-bloc states can be classified as semiperipheral sports powers. On the periphery are most Asian, African, and Latin American nations. The core may be challenged on the field of play in one sport or another (East African runners dominate middle-distance races), but control over the ideological and economic resources associated with sports still tends to lie in the West, where the IOC and the headquarters of nearly all the international sports federations are located. Despite their relative weakness in international competition, noncore countries have used regularly recurring sports festivals, such as the Asian Games, to solidify regional and national identities and to enhance international recognition and prestige. Despite programs such as Olympic Solidarity, which provides aid and technical assistance to poorer nations, material resources still tend to be concentrated in the core nations, while those on the periphery lack the means to develop and retain their athletic talent. They lose many of their best athletes to more powerful nations that can offer better training facilities, stiffer competition, and greater financial rewards. The more commercialized the sport, the greater the \u201cbrawn drain.\u201d At the turn of the 21st century, Western nations recruited not only sports scientists and coaches from the former Soviet bloc but also athletic talent from Africa and South America. This was especially true in sports such as football, where players were lured by the lucrative contracts offered by European and Japanese clubs. Noncore leagues remain in a dependent relationship with the dominant European core. In other sports, such as track and field and baseball, this drain of talent flows to the United States. Despite some competition from Japan, the West also remains overwhelmingly dominant in terms of the design, production, and marketing of sportswear and equipment. Labour migration is an important and established feature of the sporting \u201cglobal village.\u201d While this movement of workers primarily involves athletes, it also includes coaches, officials, administrators, and sports scientists. Although migrant labour has been a feature of the sports process since ancient times, the phenomenon increased in complexity and intensity during the last decades of the 20th century. This acceleration is closely tied to globalization processes. The migration of athletes and others involved in sports occurs at three levels: within nations, between nations located on the same continent, and between nations located in different continents and hemispheres. Extensive migration within nations has been common since the beginnings of modern sports in the 18th century, but intercontinental migration was infrequent before the 20th century. Recent examples of intracontinental migration include the flow of baseball players from the Dominican Republic to the United States and of eastern European football, ice hockey, and basketball players to western Europe. Coaches in these and other sports have joined the exodus. Availing themselves of their new freedom of movement, Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Romanians have moved west. Eastward expansion of the European Union, whose rules have further liberalized the labour market, has accelerated this migration. Movement of sports labour also occurs between North America, Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia in many sports, including football (soccer), baseball, and basketball. Canadians play ice hockey in Britain, Germany, France, and Switzerland; conversely, there is a flow of sports labour in the opposite direction when North American ice hockey teams acquire Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian players. American universities actively recruit Europeans to participate in track and field, football (soccer), rugby, basketball, and swimming, while large numbers of Africans have competed at the college level in the United States in basketball and track-and-field sports. What had begun as the unilateral movement of American basketball players to European professional leagues in the 1960s became a two-way flow by the end of the century, and the number of international players in the National Basketball Association increased dramatically. Similarly, while American baseball players had for decades competed on Japanese teams, beginning in the 1990s a few elite Japanese players made an impact on Major League Baseball. Australian, Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, and South African players have for decades figured prominently in English cricket. The migration of athletes between nations is sometimes complicated by the imposition by professional leagues and associations of quotas that limit the number of foreign players a team can field. In some cases these restrictions are circumvented when a player is able to claim ancestral links to another country, as Diego Maradona did when he moved from Argentina to Italy. In specific sports, such as cricket and rugby, labour migration has a seasonal pattern, with the Northern and Southern hemispheres scheduling two different seasons of play. One consequence is that the natural rhythm of the traditional sporting calendar (most often governed by climate) has diminished in importance. In other sports, participants experience an even more transitory form of migration because their \u201cworkplace\u201d constantly changes as the venue for competition shifts. Examples include the experience of European, American, and African track-and-field athletes on Europe\u2019s Grand Prix circuit and that of European and North American skiers competing in World Cup Alpine skiing. Occasionally seasonal and transitory migration patterns interweave, as they do for golf and tennis players. Tennis stars crisscross the globe in pursuit of Grand Slam titles and points that determine their world ranking. These migratory forays tend to last no more then eight days per tournament venue. In this respect, tennis players and golfers are probably the ultimate nomads of the sports migration process, with constantly shifting workplaces and places of residence. Migrant athletes have generally improved their lives, experiencing social as well as spatial mobility, but they have also experienced economic exploitation, dislocation, and culture shock. Gender relations play a significant role in contouring a migrant athlete\u2019s life. The disadvantages of sports migration have been greater for female athletes. Although women now travel more frequently and in greater numbers than in the past, men continue to move more freely (and to be paid more generously). This pattern results from social structures that continue to assume that women are solely responsible for domestic matters and child care. As with broader global processes, an economic analysis is a necessary but insufficient explanation of sports migration. The migrant trails of world sports are constructed by shifting sets of multilayered interdependencies that include not only economic but also political, historical, geographic, social, and cultural factors. As with global sports in general, a broad",
            "The first two games are competitive, the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball, but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words, chess and basketball are contests. A final distinction separates contests into two types: those that require at least a minimum of physical skill and those that do not. Shuffleboard is a good example of the first; the board games Scrabble and Monopoly will do to exemplify the second. It must of course be understood that even the simplest sports, such as weightlifting, require a modicum of intellectual effort, while others, such as baseball, involve a considerable amount of mental alertness. It must also be understood that the sports that have most excited the passions of humankind, as participants and as spectators, have required a great deal more physical prowess than a game of shuffleboard. Through the ages, sports heroes have demonstrated awesome strength, speed, stamina, endurance, and dexterity.

        "<Retrived>context": [
            "The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49]\n\nIn September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50]\n\nGeography\n\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\u00a0km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144\u00a0km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\u00a0km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.",
            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century"

The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division . Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants , nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente , the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame , and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell . Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012 , a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues. [ 5 ] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League, [ 6 ] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839\u201310,819\u2013140 (.500 winning 'percentage'). [ 7 ] The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park , a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins . History [ edit ] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club , an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City , across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. [ 8 ] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, [ 9 ] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association . Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, [ 10 ] the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. [ 11 ] Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League 's Pittsburgh Burghers . The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer , who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics . Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\". [ 12 ] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. [ 13 ] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. The 1909 Pirates in a poster celebrating their National League pennant. Frank Chance of Chicago and John McGraw of  New York, two teams the Pirates beat for the pennant, are being made to walk the plank . After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels , who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.) [ 14 ] Among those players was Honus Wagner , who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played , which they lost to Boston . The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909 , defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming"

            "the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted. [ 17 ] Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers (after the Oilers' 1987 Stanley Cup win) and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens , Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Penguins; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. In 1985\u201386 , the Penguins missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In 1986\u201387 , they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987\u201388 , for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game. [ 11 ] In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game. [ 11 ] Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989\u20131997) A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989\u201390 season , although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings ( Bryan Trottier ) and trades ( Joe Mullen , Larry Murphy , Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson ) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL entry draft . The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent. The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games, punctuated by an 8\u20130 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals , the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush , the first NHL team ever to visit the White House . [ 18 ] The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer , and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991\u201392 . [ 6 ] [ 11 ] Cancer diagnosis revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma . Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates . Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56\u201321\u20137 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy . After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of the success, the 1993 playoffs ended in the division finals when the New York Islanders eliminated the Penguins in seven games. [ 11 ] [ 6 ] The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev , Martin Straka , Aleksey Morozov , Robert Lang and Petr Nedved , and defensemen Sergei Zubov , Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher . Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games. [ 11 ] Lemieux's retirement and return (1997\u20132001) Lemieux with the Penguins during the 2000\u201301 season , his first season after coming out of retirement. On April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin. The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4\u20131 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20132 in the second round. By this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998. Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity \u2013 enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle ) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time. [ 6 ] Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player\u2013owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs , highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the conference finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.

        "<Retrived>context": [
            "2. The Finance Department may audit the taxpayer\u2019s records. 3.

The Finance Department may utilize a collection agency to assist in the collection of\n\ndelinquent taxes. 5. The Finance Department may prepare and issue a wage attachment to employers of a\n\ntaxpayer when that  taxpayer does not remit timely payment of taxes due to the Department\n\nof Finance. 6.

The Finance Department may file a criminal complaint against a taxpayer who fails to file the\n\nappropriate tax return or pay a delinquent tax.",
            "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT It is the obligation of all taxpayers to file all local tax returns voluntarily and pay all local taxes to which they are subject. However, when the Treasurer and/or one of his designated agents determines that a required tax return has not been filed, or a tax liability has not been paid, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights grants certain legal rights to the taxpayers, and imposes obligations on taxing authorities to ensure that equality and fairness guide local governments in the collection of taxes. In addition, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights provides the local government entity with certain legal methods to enforce taxpayer obligations. This Disclosure Statement sets forth your rights as a taxpayer in connection with any audit, examination, appeal or refund claim of taxes for the City of Pittsburgh, and any enforcement or collection actions taken by the Treasurer of the City of Pittsburgh. APPLICABILITY \u2013 ELIGIBLE TAXES This Disclosure Statement applies to all eligible taxes levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For this purpose, eligible taxes do not include real property taxes. The specific eligible taxes levied by the City of Pittsburgh are: EARNED INCOME TAX, LOCAL SERVICES TAX, BUSINESS PRIVILEGE TAX, MERCANTILE TAX, MERCANTILE LICENSE, AMUSEMENT TAX, NET PROFIT TAX, WAGE TAX, INSTITUTION AND SERVICE PRIVILEGE TAX, PAYROLL EXPENSE TAX and PARKING TAX. Unless expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights, the failure of any person acting on behalf of the Treasurer to comply with any provisions of this Disclosure Statement, related regulations, or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the taxpayer from paying the taxes owed. TAXPAYER\u2019S RIGHTS DURING AN AUDIT The taxpayer shall have at least thirty (30) calendar days from the mailing date to respond to requests for information by the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance shall grant additional reasonable extensions, thirty (30) days, upon written application for good cause. The taxpayer also has the right to be represented during this process. The taxpayer has the right to expect that all information requested by and submitted to the Department of Finance will remain confidential, and will only be used for official purposes or as provided by law. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE\u2019S OBLIGATIONS DURING AN AUDIT The Finance Department shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the basis for any underpayment that the Finance Department has determined to exist. The notification shall include: 1. The tax period or periods for which the underpayment is asserted. 2. The amount of the underpayment detailed by tax period. 3. The legal basis upon which the Finance Department has relied to determine that an underpayment exists. 4. An itemization of the revisions made by the Finance Department to a return or report filed by the taxpayer that results in the determination that an underpayment exists. The Finance Department shall take no lawful action against a taxpayer for the tax year or years in question until the expiration of the applicable response period, including extensions. The Finance Department shall respect the confidential nature of information gained through the audit. The Finance Department shall process the audit timely upon receipt of all the applicable information. The Finance Department shall make copies of this disclosure statement available to taxpayer upon request at no charge to the taxpayer, including mailing costs. The Finance Department may require a taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer\u2019s Federal Individual Income Tax Return if the Finance Department can demonstrate that the Federal Tax information is reasonably necessary for the enforcement or collection of a tax and the information is not available from other available sources of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. The taxpayer is solely responsible for obtaining the information and for any costs associated with obtaining the records or information. TAXPAYER\u2019S RIGHT TO APPEAL A taxpayer that disagrees with an assessment made by the Department of Finance has 90 days from the date of the assessment notice to file a written petition for reassessment. The petition shall contain: 1."

        "Question": "Who was the first African-American head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, starting in 2007?",

        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Cookie List\n\nURL: https://www.steelers.com/news/mitchell-broke-barriers-to-live-out-his-dream\n\nCONTENT:\n\nIn celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today we look at the career of Assistant Head Coach John Mitchell, who was the first black player, captain, All-American and assistant coach at the University of Alabama. Like many young kids growing up in Mobile, Alabama, John Mitchell dreamt about going to the University of Alabama. But like so many young kids growing up in his Mobile neighborhood, at the time that he did, he knew that it was most likely nothing more than that \u2013 a dream. Mitchell was born in 1951, a time when there was segregation in Alabama and throughout the South. And it wasn't just in the schools where it was felt, it was everyday life where blacks and whites were separated, and he had to deal with every aspect of it. \"It was pretty tough as a kid growing up, especially right there in Mobile and the state of Alabama,\" said Mitchell. \"People talk now about confederate flags, at that time they were everywhere, in the stores, shopping centers. If they had a confederate flag in the window or outside the door, that was a sign that people of color were not welcome. At that time schools were segregated. There were black schools and white schools. Transportation was segregated. Black people would pay the same as white people but had to sit at the back of the bus. If they bus was crowded, they had to get up and give their seat to a white person. They had separate restaurants, shopping. Black people, if you went to the movies, you had to go through the back door to go in and then they couldn't sit in the front of the theater, they had to sit in the balcony.\"\n\nMitchell often wondered why. Why was there such a divide, a divide highlighted by those who lived on the other side of the railroad track. \"I asked my parents (John Sr. and Alice Mitchell) questions,\" said Mitchell. \"They told me black people were treated a lot different than white people. You had to be aware of your surroundings and the things you did. Right there in Mobile, where I went to high school, there is a railroad track that goes right through the city. When I went to the other side of that track, if I was there after 6 o'clock, black people were arrested for trespassing because they were in a white neighborhood and most of the time, they said you had no business there. \"My parents were cognizant of me not being where I shouldn't be at certain hours of the night. When I would go out as a young guy, dating in high school, they told me places I could go, places I shouldn't go.",

The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference . The team has played its home games at PPG Paints Arena since 2010, and has previously played at the Civic Arena , which was better known by its nickname \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams \u2013 the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL . Founded during the 1967 expansion , the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals , winning the Stanley Cup five times \u2013 in 1991 , 1992 , 2009 , 2016 , and 2017 . Along with the Edmonton Oilers , the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non- Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame , including co-owner Mario Lemieux , who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr , Sidney Crosby , and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise. History Early years (1967\u20131984) Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League 's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor , a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania , began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III , Pittsburgh Steelers ' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family 's Richard Mellon Scaife . The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners ; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris , owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris , owner of the Detroit Red Wings . The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967\u201368 season . The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena 's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Civic Arena 's capacity was increased to meet NHL requirements for a franchise. The arena served as the Penguins' home arena from 1967 to 2010. A contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio . (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena), [ 7 ] [ 8 ] a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \" Golden Triangle \" of downtown Pittsburgh. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley , opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario , [ 10 ] on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate , all-star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and New York Rangers ' veteran Earl Ingarfield , a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald , and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley . George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain. [ 11 ] On October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens . [ 5 ] On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4\u20132. However, the Penguins went 27\u201334\u201313 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley , who recorded a 2.88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game . Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti . [ 6 ] The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players \u2013 including longtime future Penguins star Jean Pronovost \u2013 making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains. Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969\u20131974) Michel Briere 's number was taken out of circulation after his career-ending accident in 1970. It was later formally retired in 2001. In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke . Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago",

I just know I'm excited.\"\n\nWhen Renee Minnemeyer-Climo joined the Steelers season ticket waiting list in 1995, she was told it would likely be 20 years until her name would come off the list and she would have the opportunity to purchase tickets. The timing was dead on. In 2015, Minnemeyer-Climo got an email from the Steelers ticket office, and her dream came true. \"It was crazy,\" said Minnemeyer-Climo, who is from Beaver Falls, Pa. \"They said when we got on the list it was about a 20 year wait, and it was literally a 20 year wait. We got married, got on the list, and it was a great 20th anniversary gift. \"I got an email about it and the first thing I did was call my husband. Then they said you had to have your decision fast.

[ 140 ] Training camp Steelers at training camp in Latrobe The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe . [ 141 ] The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: \"... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania , an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland . Classic, wonderful slice of American culture . If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see.\" [ 142 ] The team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside . Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team. [ 143 ] In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season. [ 144 ] Historical facilities The Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s. [ 145 ] In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices. [ 146 ] During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director) [ 147 ] [ 148 ] and suburban Ligonier [ 149 ] also served as a pre-season training camp sites.

            "Cookie List\n\nURL: https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-feb-11-x8655\n\nCONTENT:\n\nAsked and Answered\n\nAsked and Answered: Feb. 11\n\nSteelers.com\n\nLet's get to it:\n\nROBERT YEAGER FROM CANYON COUNTRY, CA: With all the popular options of alternative uniforms in the NFL, have the Steelers ever thought about honoring the gold shoulder pad uniforms? I thought those were very cool/different than other NFL uniforms of the day. ANSWER: I am not privy to the conversations/decisions about selecting a throwback jersey for a particular season, but the uniforms you reference certainly were unique and part of my early memories of the Steelers and the NFL. The following is something I wrote for Steelers.com about the origin of those uniforms and their brief history with the franchise:\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Green Bay Packers were the National Football League's dominant team. They had won championships in 1961, 1962, 1965 and 1966, and they had played for the title in 1960. In that respect, every NFL team wanted to be like the Packers. Dan Rooney might have wanted the Steelers to win like the Packers, but he didn't necessarily want them to look like the Green Bay Packers. In early 1966, the Steelers players had an executive committee that would meet with ownership about issues that concerned them. At that time, one of the issues was the uniform. John Campbell, a linebacker going into his second season with the team, was on the executive committee, and he was the one who asked Dan Rooney to do something about the uniform. Mindful of how many teams were morphing into Packers look-a-likes, Dan Rooney decided to make an attempt at something distinctive. That also was the time when the City of Pittsburgh was trying to remake its image, trying to get away from the perception of a dirty, smoky city. One of the areas being refurbished was Downtown, called the \"Golden Triangle\" because that was the shape of the land created by the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers flowing into the Ohio River. Dan Rooney decided to incorporate this unique bit of the city's geography into the Steelers new uniforms, and that's how the triangle design came to be a part of the jersey. The triangle was always gold, with the rest of the home jersey being black with white numbers and the road jersey being white with black numbers. But if the intent of linking the team to its city was a nice idea, the practical execution of it didn't always go smoothly. For example, washing the uniforms. In 1966, the Steelers preseason finale was against the Cleveland Browns in Birmingham, Ala., and they were to wear the black jerseys with the gold triangles, because the Browns always preferred to wear their white jerseys. But in laundering the Steelers' jerseys, the black bled into the gold triangles and created an aesthetic mess. And then, not everyone was able to make the connection between the Steelers' jerseys and Pittsburgh's geography. Midway through the 1966 season, the Steelers were set to play a game against the Cowboys in Dallas on Oct. 30. Like the Browns, the Cowboys always preferred to wear white jerseys, and so the Steelers were outfitted in their black jerseys with the gold triangles. Shortly before kickoff, Dan Rooney appeared on the Cowboys pregame radio show to promote the matchup and he was asked, \"Are your wearing those uniforms because tomorrow is Halloween?\"\n\nAnd so following the 1967 season, the Steelers \"retired\" their golden triangle jerseys for good, but they still remain an interesting part of the franchise's rich history.

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933\u2013present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season . [ 21 ] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969 , Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970 , Jack Ham in 1971 , Franco Harris in 1972 , [ 22 ] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann , Jack Lambert , John Stallworth , Donnie Shell and Mike Webster .

        "Question": "Who led the Pittsburgh Pirates to three straight pennants at the turn of the 20th century?",

            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first",

However, when the Treasurer and/or one of his designated agents determines that a required tax return has not been filed, or a tax liability has not been paid, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights grants certain legal rights to the taxpayers, and imposes obligations on taxing authorities to ensure that equality and fairness guide local governments in the collection of taxes. In addition, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights provides the local government entity with certain legal methods to enforce taxpayer obligations.

Unless expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights, the failure of any person acting on behalf of the Treasurer to comply with any provisions of this Disclosure Statement, related regulations, or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the taxpayer from paying the taxes owed. TAXPAYER\u2019S RIGHTS DURING AN AUDIT The taxpayer shall have at least thirty (30) calendar days from the mailing date to respond to requests for information by the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance shall grant additional reasonable extensions, thirty (30) days, upon written application for good cause.

The Finance Department shall respect the confidential nature of information gained through the audit. The Finance Department shall process the audit timely upon receipt of all the applicable information. The Finance Department shall make copies of this disclosure statement available to taxpayer upon request at no charge to the taxpayer, including mailing costs.

The utilization by the Treasurer of one remedy does not preclude utilization of the other. Moreover, use of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not preclude the use by the City of Pittsburgh of any other legal or administrative procedure which can bring about compliance by the taxpayer with the provisions of Chapter 258 of the Pittsburgh Code and these regulations. Any voluntary payment made by a Taxpayer, unless otherwise specified in writing, shall be applied first to tax, then to interest, then to penalty, then to any other fees or charges. Local Taxpayer Bill of Rights, 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8429. SECTION 502 \u2013 SUITS FOR RECOVERY OF UNPAID TAXES The Treasurer may sue in the name of the City of Pittsburgh, in law or in equity, for the recovery of those taxes due and unpaid under the provisions of the Payroll Tax, to compel the production of records or to enforce any other provisions of the law. SECTION 503 - LIMITATIONS a. The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of taxes. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.303(g).",
            "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT It is the obligation of all taxpayers to file all local tax returns voluntarily and pay all local taxes to which they are subject. However, when the Treasurer and/or one of his designated agents determines that a required tax return has not been filed, or a tax liability has not been paid, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights grants certain legal rights to the taxpayers, and imposes obligations on taxing authorities to ensure that equality and fairness guide local governments in the collection of taxes. In addition, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights provides the local government entity with certain legal methods to enforce taxpayer obligations. This Disclosure Statement sets forth your rights as a taxpayer in connection with any audit, examination, appeal or refund claim of taxes for the City of Pittsburgh, and any enforcement or collection actions taken by the Treasurer of the City of Pittsburgh. APPLICABILITY \u2013 ELIGIBLE TAXES This Disclosure Statement applies to all eligible taxes levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For this purpose, eligible taxes do not include real property taxes. The specific eligible taxes levied by the City of Pittsburgh are: EARNED INCOME TAX, LOCAL SERVICES TAX, BUSINESS PRIVILEGE TAX, MERCANTILE TAX, MERCANTILE LICENSE, AMUSEMENT TAX, NET PROFIT TAX, WAGE TAX, INSTITUTION AND SERVICE PRIVILEGE TAX, PAYROLL EXPENSE TAX and PARKING TAX. Unless expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights, the failure of any person acting on behalf of the Treasurer to comply with any provisions of this Disclosure Statement, related regulations, or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the taxpayer from paying the taxes owed. TAXPAYER\u2019S RIGHTS DURING AN AUDIT The taxpayer shall have at least thirty (30) calendar days from the mailing date to respond to requests for information by the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance shall grant additional reasonable extensions, thirty (30) days, upon written application for good cause. The taxpayer also has the right to be represented during this process. The taxpayer has the right to expect that all information requested by and submitted to the Department of Finance will remain confidential, and will only be used for official purposes or as provided by law. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE\u2019S OBLIGATIONS DURING AN AUDIT The Finance Department shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the basis for any underpayment that the Finance Department has determined to exist. The notification shall include: 1. The tax period or periods for which the underpayment is asserted. 2. The amount of the underpayment detailed by tax period. 3. The legal basis upon which the Finance Department has relied to determine that an underpayment exists. 4. An itemization of the revisions made by the Finance Department to a return or report filed by the taxpayer that results in the determination that an underpayment exists. The Finance Department shall take no lawful action against a taxpayer for the tax year or years in question until the expiration of the applicable response period, including extensions. The Finance Department shall respect the confidential nature of information gained through the audit. The Finance Department shall process the audit timely upon receipt of all the applicable information. The Finance Department shall make copies of this disclosure statement available to taxpayer upon request at no charge to the taxpayer, including mailing costs. The Finance Department may require a taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer\u2019s Federal Individual Income Tax Return if the Finance Department can demonstrate that the Federal Tax information is reasonably necessary for the enforcement or collection of a tax and the information is not available from other available sources of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. The taxpayer is solely responsible for obtaining the information and for any costs associated with obtaining the records or information. TAXPAYER\u2019S RIGHT TO APPEAL A taxpayer that disagrees with an assessment made by the Department of Finance has 90 days from the date of the assessment notice to file a written petition for reassessment. The petition shall contain: 1."

Third-Party Use of Carnegie Mellon Trademarks A license is required for any individual, organization, or company to reproduce or otherwise use Carnegie Mellon\u2019s name or trademarks for a commercial or non- commercial venture. Each specific use of a Carnegie Mellon trademark requires written approval from the Trademark Licensing Office. All licensees must comply with the Carnegie Mellon Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees. Approval of licenses is also subject to the Product and Art Approval Guidelines below. Approval for a specific use or design for one application does not grant permission to alter the design in any way or to use the same design for another purpose, without seeking additional written approval from the Trademark Licensing Office. For example, approval to use a particular design on a T-Shirt does not automatically grant approval to use the same design on a coffee mug. Third-party organizations that need to use Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s trademarks in relation to verifiable partnerships or non-commercial or promotional activities should request permission to do so from the Marketing and Communications Division. Any permission granted would be documented in an agreement signed by both parties. Third- party promotional products co-branded with Carnegie Mellon University trademarks requires dual art review from the Trademark Licensing Office and the Marketing and Communications Division. Product and Art Approval Guidelines All products bearing Carnegie Mellon trademarks should follow the Merchandise Guidelines established under the Brand Standards established by the Marketing and Communications Division. Carnegie Mellon will not license products that do not meet minimum standards of quality and/or good taste in university\u2019s sole opinion, or products that are judged to be dangerous or carry high product liability risks. The following products normally will not be approved by the Trademark Licensing Office: \u2022 products that could be used to injure or kill; \u2022 products that could present a high-liability exposure; \u2022 alcoholic beverage products; \u2022 tobacco-related products;\n\n202\n\nsexually suggestive products;\n\nobscene, disparaging, or discriminatory products;\n\nproducts that are inimical to the mission or image of the university. Additionally, certain art/designs will not be approved for use in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon's trademarks. These include the following:\n\nart depicting the use or endorsement of alcohol;\n\nart depicting the use or endorsement of illegal drugs;\n\nart depicting the use or endorsement of tobacco products;\n\nart depicting the use or endorsement of firearms or other weapons;\n\nart depicting racist, sexist, hateful, demeaning or degrading language or statements;\n\nart depicting profanity;\n\nart depicting sexual acts;\n\nart depicting statements impugning other universities;\n\nart or a design incorporating trademarks or copyrights not owned by the university, unless written permission for such use is obtained from the mark holder or copyright owner. Carnegie Mellon reserves the right to approve or disapprove any use of trademarks, even if not explicitly prohibited by these guidelines. Product and Art Approval Panel The Trademark Licensing Office reserves the right to interpret the Product and Art Approval Guidelines and decline to grant licenses for uses that violate the guidelines. The Trademark Licensing Office may also refer any questionable or potentially controversial licensing requests to the Vice President and General Counsel and the Vice President for Marketing and Communications, or their designees. Appeals of decisions made by the Trademark Licensing Office may also be referred to the Vice President and General Counsel and the Vice President for Marketing and Communications, or their designees. Selecting Suppliers The Trademark Licensing Office has established licensing agreements with a number of suppliers who provide a variety of products. A complete list of all current licensees is available at http://www.cmu.edu/trademark/suppliers/index.html. Individuals or groups\n\n203\n\nseeking a supplier should first review this list to determine if the required items may be obtained from one of the current licensees. If it is necessary to use a supplier that is not licensed, consult the Trademark Licensing Office. Royalties Royalties are collected from a licensee for the use of Carnegie Mellon's trademarks. The net income from the licensing program benefits the overall mission of Carnegie Mellon; after expenses are covered, net income is used for the university's Education & General Operating (E&GO) budget. Contact the Trademark Licensing Office for information on royalty-exempt products. Contact Established in 1994, the Trademark Licensing Office welcomes any questions you have regarding this policy or the proper use of Carnegie Mellon trademarks.

Anderson, and his wife Sheree Lanihun-Anderson, started the Lanihun-Anderson Foundation to serve as a baseline of financial health and peace for others. Their mission is to bridge the financial disparity gap by providing knowledge, resources and opportunities to others. \"We started the foundation with a focus on financial literacy,\" said Anderson. \"Both of us have identified that a lot of people, especially in their early adult life, are distracted by trying to manage their finances and understand how to budget. Really simple principles that I think they would benefit greatly from if they learned those as early as possible. So, we try to target high school and middle school aged kids and just teach them fundamental financial literacy building blocks, like how to budget and what to do when you have a certain amount of money. When they get their first job, for example, they can build a structure that hopefully when they grow into having a professional income, that they have some understanding of what they want to do with their money so they can alleviate that stress and focus on the things that everybody has. Aptitudes that they are gifted with so they can focus on those things as opposed to figuring out how to do with finances.\"\n\nAnderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is. \"I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger,\" said Anderson. \"So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time.\"\n\nSpencer Anderson Cause: Autism Speaks\n\nSpencer Anderson's heart told him that the cause he chose for his cleats as a part of My Cause My Cleats was the right choice to make. While it's nothing that has touched his family directly, it has impacted several people close to him and that is why he selected Autism Speaks to represent with his cleats. \"I feel like it's one of those things that isn't talked about often enough,\" said Anderson. \"One of my close friends is autistic. I have known a lot of people growing up that were autistic. I feel like a lot of people don't understand. It's kind of frowned upon. People will whisper, will say he has autism you have to be easy with him. \"They are normal people. I have interacted with many of them. It's not talked about enough. The cases aren't as common as cancer, mental health, but it's something people should be aware of. \"I have a close family friend, a friend of my mom's, and she has a son who has been autistic his whole life. Interacting with him you know they are real people, they interact normally. They have their moments, but they can do good in society and in the world. It's not something that they should be looked down upon, or shunned, or turn a cold shoulder.\"\n\nAnderson welcomes the opportunity to be an advocate for those with autism, whether it's through his cleats or just in daily life. He knows they are the same as him, people who can lead a normal life, but just might have some obstacles to overcome as they do. \"They can be way smarter than most of us,\" said Anderson. \"I went to school with someone who had autism and he was way smarter than all of us. You could have jar of marbles, and he could just look at it and tell you the number of marbles in the jar and he would be right. You would be, like, wow."

        "Question": "What was the name of the rebellion against federal taxes on whiskey in Western Pennsylvania?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Whiskey Rebellion",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s.",
            "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture\n\nOakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]\n\nNew immigrants and migrants\n\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire."

        "<Generated>Answer": "1794",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Contents\n\nHistory of Pittsburgh\n\nThe history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Ja\u00f6deog\u00eb\u2019 in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s.",
            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century"

The police, the media, and the museum\u2019s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son\u2019s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son\u2019s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud\u2019s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona\u2019s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother\u2019s death have reverberated throughout Mona\u2019s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona\u2019s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It\u2019s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona\u2019s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. courtesy of the creators\n\nDETAILS & RESOURCES\n\nWe want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!",

CHILD POLICY:\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nOn November 14, 2016, two teenagers in the Russian village of\u00a0Strugi\u00a0Krasnye\u00a0began broadcasting video of themselves through Periscope, a live-streaming website. The pair, named Denis and Katya, explained to their viewers that they had run away, had hidden in a cabin for three days, fought violently with Katya\u2019s relatives when confronted, and were now barricaded in the cabin and under threat by local police and Special Forces. The Periscope audience grew throughout the day as they streamed more videos.

The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. Act 1Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed by news that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. He offers his kingdom and Armida\u2019s hand in marriage to the Christian knight Rinaldo if he agrees to fight against his fellow Christians. Enchanted and obsessed with Armida, Rinaldo vows to betray his men and his faith. Meanwhile, Armida, tormented by her passionate love for Rinaldo, pleads with the gods for his safety. Scene 2: A mountainside. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarca plan to rescue Rinaldo from Armida\u2019s enchantment. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians. However, upon encountering Clotarca, Zelmira falls in love with her, despite her better judgment, and offers to lead her to safety. Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of Idreno\u2019s approaching forces. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo about Armida\u2019s charms and chastises him for abandoning his Christian duty. Though remorseful, Rinaldo remains unable to break free from Armida\u2019s enchantment. Act 2Scene 1: Back in the council chamber. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarca's demand that the Christian knight enchanted by Armida be freed. Though the spell is broken, Rinaldo reluctantly leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury. Scene 2: Back at the mountainside. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo back as he prepares to rejoin the crusaders in battle. Armida arrives, pleading for refuge and Rinaldo\u2019s love. Rinaldo, torn but resolute, departs for battle with Ubaldo, leaving Armida betrayed and alone. Act 3\n\nScene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, aware that the myrtle tree holds the secret to Armida\u2019s powers, enters the grove to destroy it. Zelmira and a group of nymphs appear, attempting to persuade him to return to Armida. As Rinaldo raises his weapon to strike the myrtle, a disheveled Armida emerges from the tree and confronts him. Unable to kill Rinaldo despite her fury, she watches as he strikes the tree, causing the magic wood to fall lifeless. As Rinaldo tries to escape, he declares to still love her. Armida, consumed by fury, turns into a monster of rage, destroying all in her path.

            "EVENT HIGHLIGHTS. International Food FairAt the heart of One Big Table is a sprawling international food fair presented by restaurants from our local neighborhoods, where chefs, culinary artists, and food enthusiasts come together to prepare and present a world-class selection of global cuisines from local restaurants. Many of the featured restaurants are immigrant-owned. Attendees can embark on a culinary journey, savoring dishes from every corner of the world, spicy Thai curries, flavorful Mexican empanadas, delicate French pastries, flaky Indian samosas, and so much more. The food fair offers a unique opportunity to taste, learn, and appreciate different culinary traditions. Entertainment ExtravaganzaThe event is a feast not just for the palate but for all the senses, featuring an array of live performances that represent diverse cultures and talents from across the globe. Attendees can expect to be mesmerized by traditional dances, live music, and much more. Each performance adds to the vibrancy of the event, creating a unique atmosphere of celebration and unity. Global MarketplaceFor those looking to take a piece of the world home, a global marketplace features unique products, souvenirs, and international handicrafts. It's a great opportunity to shop for one-of-a-kind items from around the globe. Some of the artists selected to participate may have benefited from Literacy Pittsburgh programming themselves. WHO BENEFITS. Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job. Proceeds from One Big Table provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness. April 3, 2025."

[ 66 ] Their postseason was short lived with a 45\u201342 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. [ 67 ] Despite a 9\u20136\u20131 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs. [ 68 ] The Steelers went 8\u20138 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season. [ 69 ] The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11\u20130 start. [ 70 ] However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12\u20134. [ 71 ] The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48\u201337. [ 72 ] The 2021 season saw the team go 9\u20137\u20131 and make the postseason. [ 73 ] The Steelers lost 42\u201321 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. [ 74 ] Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season. [ 75 ] Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162\u201394\u20132 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013\u201317 seasons were noted for record performances from the \" Killer B's \". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown , Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell . [ 76 ] Occasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals. [ 77 ] Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. [ 78 ] Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9\u20138 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season. [ 79 ] In the 2023 season, the team finished 10\u20137 and third in the AFC North. [ 80 ] They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31\u201317. [ 81 ] Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. [ 82 ] The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Summary Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444\u2013282\u20132 (.635) and an overall record of 480\u2013305\u20132 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. [ 85 ] Ownership Art Rooney II , controlling owner of the Steelers Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations. [ 86 ] Dan Rooney , and his son, Art Rooney II , president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers\u00a0\u2013 Timothy and Patrick\u00a0\u2013 wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York. [ 87 ] Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines , causing them to violate \"NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests\". [ 88 ] Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time: Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr. , John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys. The Robert A. Paul family of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, which is primarily involved with Pittsburgh-based Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation as well as Morton's Restaurant Group, Urban Active Fitness, Meyer Products and Harley Marine Services. Additionally, family members serve on numerous boards , including Cornell University, UPMC , University of Pittsburgh , the American Red Cross , Harvard Medical School and the Loomis Chaffee School.

[ 92 ] Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams: [ 93 ] Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam purchased the Cleveland Browns in 2012. Hedge fund manager David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018. Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils owner Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders in 2023. Investment partner David Blitzer was also a part of the Harris group. Season-by-season records Further information: List of Pittsburgh Steelers seasons Through the end of the 2023 season , the Steelers have an all-time record of 707\u2013606\u201322, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times. [ 94 ] In the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). [ 95 ] The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The Steelers are 36\u201326 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger. [ 98 ] Civil rights advocacy The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry ), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam ), [ a ] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris ), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy ), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer ( Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).

The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division . Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants , nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente , the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame , and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell . Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012 , a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues. [ 5 ] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League, [ 6 ] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839\u201310,819\u2013140 (.500 winning 'percentage'). [ 7 ] The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park , a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins . History [ edit ] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club , an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City , across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. [ 8 ] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, [ 9 ] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association . Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, [ 10 ] the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. [ 11 ] Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League 's Pittsburgh Burghers . The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer , who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics . Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\". [ 12 ] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. [ 13 ] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. The 1909 Pirates in a poster celebrating their National League pennant. Frank Chance of Chicago and John McGraw of  New York, two teams the Pirates beat for the pennant, are being made to walk the plank . After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels , who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.) [ 14 ] Among those players was Honus Wagner , who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played , which they lost to Boston . The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909 , defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming",

The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise, having been founded in 1881, and plays in the Central Division of the National League. The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[205]\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990\u201392) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014\u20132015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[206]\n\nFootball\n\nThe city's professional team, NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, is named after the distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[207] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[208] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. College football in the city dates to 1889[209] with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships, qualifying 37 total bowl games, appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, and winning the 2021 ACC Championship Game which was the program's first conference title since leaving the Big East for the ACC between the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[210] Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Acrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[211] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier. Hockey\n\nThe NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's founding in 1967. The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance \"The Igloo\".[212]\n\nIce hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213]\n\nThe NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936\u20131967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[214] Pro-grade ice rinks in the region include the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe. Basketball\n\nProfessional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937\u201345 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947\u201348 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961\u201363), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970\u201372), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004\u201308) and Phantoms (2009\u201310) both of the ABA. Three Pittsburgh universities, the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and Robert Morris University, compete in NCAA Division I basketball. Pitt and Duquesne are the traditional basketball powers in the city, but all three universities have made multiple appearances in the National Invitation Tournament and NCAA tournament. Pitt won two pre-NCAA tournament National Championships in 1928 and 1930[215] while Duquesne won the NIT title in 1955, its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Both Pitt and Duquesne have reached the NCAA tournament Final Four once, Duquesne in 1940 and Pitt in 1941. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. Soccer\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Riverhounds play their home games at Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[citation needed]\n\nGolf\n\nGolf has deep roots in the area. The oldest U.S. course in continuous use, Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887 calls the region home.[216] Suburban Oakmont Country Club holds the record for most times as host for the U.S. Open at nine; it has also hosted the U.S. Women's Open, PGA Championships, and U.S. Amateurs.[217]"

Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.[118]\n\nIn 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century"

Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. Our Story\n\nThe Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center\u2019s collections. The Historical Society brought our region\u2019s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region\u2019s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region\u2019s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region\u2019s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members\u2019 homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania\u2019s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh\u2019s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum\u2019s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. Heinz History Center\n\nAs Pittsburgh\u2019s \u201cpeople museum,\u201d the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood\u201d and the world\u2019s oldest jeep. Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum\n\nThe Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center\u2019s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions. From football to baseball and hockey to golf, the Sports Museum highlights the region\u2019s passion for amateur and professional sports. Fort Pitt Museum\n\nThe Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that presents the story of Western Pennsylvania\u2019s essential role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh. Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village\n\nMeadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America, is located in Avella, Washington County, Pa. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a National Historic Landmark, features 19,000-year-old evidence of the region\u2019s earliest inhabitants under a massive rock overhang. In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years. Detre Library & Archives\n\nMore than 250 years of our region\u2019s history can be found at the Thomas and Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Founded in 1879, the Library & Archives\u2019 collections are accessible to researchers, students, and the general public.

In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture\n\nOakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]\n\nNew immigrants and migrants\n\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire."

As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the 2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY\u00ae nominations, and he and the orchestra won the GRAMMY\u00ae for \"Best Orchestral Performance\" in 2018. The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical acclaim. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven\u2019s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart\u2019s Idomeneo . Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites, including Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Jen\u016ffa , Strauss\u2019s Elektra , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Rusalka as well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss\u2019s Salome , was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Z\u00fcrich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty years. In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on the music of this composer. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him \"Artist of the Year\". Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.",

        "Question": "What was the name of the treaty signed by the Iroquois in 1768?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Fort Stanwix Treaty",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town\", near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town\", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]:\u200a148\n\nAfter Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]\n\nThe Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]\n\nIncreasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4]\n\nWith the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4]\n\nAfter the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24]\n\nThe village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25]\n\nMany farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]\n\nIron City (1800\u20131859)\n\nCommerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]\n\nThe 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
            "Exploration and settlement was further discouraged by the size and complexity of the lateral mountain ranges, the rugged courses of many of the streams and rivers, and the ubiquitous dense forest. The central Appalachians, with their more spacious water gaps affording easy passage, attracted the largest number of early settlers. Many of these were Germans and Scotch-Irish who went into the interior of Pennsylvania and subsequently migrated down the Great Appalachian Valley in Virginia and Tennessee. In the New England Appalachians the narrow notches, often blocked by glacial debris, and the steepness of the mountains discouraged early settlement\u2014as did the massive ruggedness of the successive ranges in the southern Appalachians\u2014so that each of these regions remained a wilderness long after the American frontiersman Daniel Boone had forged his pioneer route through the Cumberland Gap. During the French and Indian War (1754\u201363), trails to the Ohio country and Great Lakes led through central Appalachia, and these, with their scattered lonely forts of the interior, became brutal battlegrounds of border warfare. Indian allies of the British waged bloody skirmishes against Appalachian settlements during the American Revolution (1775\u201383), but the Appalachian Mountains confined most of that struggle for independence to the Eastern Seaboard. The diversity that characterizes Appalachian plant and animal life also exists in the system\u2019s mineral resources. As the immense stands of timber throughout the Appalachians brought into existence important lumber and wood-pulp industries, so rich coal beds, veins of iron ore, salt springs and licks, and deposits of granite and marble created major American industries in the region. Each of these has been attended by its own peculiar problems, especially in the field of conservation. There is, for instance, pollution of Appalachian waterways by the pulp and chemical industries and the devastation of land and human resources brought on by certain coal-mining operations. Air pollution, especially in the form of acid rain and fog, has taken a toll on Appalachian forests from North Carolina to Canada. The pinnacle of the Appalachians, Mount Mitchell, once called Black Dome because of its blanket of virgin evergreens, is now a ghost forest of dead trees. Despite the early arrival of the lumber industry and the opening of the coal mines, some areas of Appalachia remained isolated until early in the 20th century, notably those mountain areas of the southern region where rough terrain hindered road building. As a consequence, Southern Appalachian highlanders developed a distinctive culture characterized by handicrafts, ballads, folklore, and mores that reflect both the massive problems and the rich potential of the region. By Chick-fil-A\n\nThe Appalachian region has developed into one of the premier recreational areas of North America."

            "The level of detail is the only substantial difference\n\nbetween each report within a section. Departmental Sections\n\nThe most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in\n\nthe Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been\n\nappropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the\n\nDepartmental Sections of the Operating Budget. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\n\nFiscal Year 2024\n\nBudget Guide\n\n28\n\nOrganization Chart\n\nThe organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau,\n\nor Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with\n\nthe exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions. Departmental Overview\n\nAt the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the\n\norganization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the\n\ndepartment. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency,\n\nBureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed. Position Summary\n\nThe position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or \u201cFTE,\u201d\n\nrepresents the number of full-time workers in the position. The \u201cRate/Grade\u201d category indicates how an\n\nemployee\u2019s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees\n\ncan be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a \u201c12\u201d in the \u201cHours/Months\u201d column\n\nindicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or\n\nending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The\n\n\u201cBudget\u201d column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The\n\n\u201cVacancy Allowance\u201d adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions\n\nthroughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons. Subclass Detail\n\nThis portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass\n\nand object account level. For example, the general \u201cProfessional and Technical Services\u201d subclass will highlight\n\nthe appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as \u201cAdministrative Fees,\u201d \u201cWorkforce Training,\u201d and\n\n\u201cComputer Maintenance.\u201d Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted\n\nexpenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024\n\nbudgeted amounts. Under the Personnel \u2013 Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular salary represents\n\nthe total base pay for the organization. Longevity pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining\n\nagreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or\n\nseasonal workers, as well as student interns.",
            "When uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs\n\nare listed accordingly. Leave Buyback represents sick leave hours that can be \u201csold back\u201d to the City. Premium\n\nPay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements are funds from outside sources that are\n\nused to offset certain position expenses. Five-Year Forecasts\n\nFinally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to\n\nthe 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included\n\nas a reference point. Note for Fund Accounts\n\nFor special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is\n\ncomposed of the \u201cProjected Beginning Balance\u201d for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and\n\nthe \u201cProjected Ending Balance\u201d for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year."

Coordinated, concentrated and comprehensive carbon mitigation action is needed to reduce the severity of regional impacts and prepare for low carbon economy. To address these challenges, Pittsburgh has created the Climate Action Plan. Climate Action Plan 3.0 lays out strategies through which Pittsburgh can reduce greenhouse gas emissions within city limits and within City operations. This will lessen Pittsburgh\u2019s contribution to global climate change. Climate Action Plan 3.0 (PDF,\u00a04MB): /files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/7101_pittsburgh_climate_action_plan_3.0.pdf\n\nPittsburgh's Green Guide (PDF,\u00a05MB): /files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/7102_pittsburgh_residents__green_guide.pdf\n\nClimate Action Plan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcUqkRhYV6E\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s goal is to measure climate and ecological impact, and report findings, annually. The Greenhouse Gas Inventory quantifies emissions and analyzes the sources of those emissions. This data helps to inform mitigation strategies and is essential for tracking progress toward future reduction goals. Chapter One\n\n2018 Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n\nBy 2030, Pittsburgh will reduce emissions by 50% from 2003 amounts and power all City facilities with 100% clean energy. Through efforts to reduce line loss and modernizing energy systems, this goal can become a reality. Chapter Two\n\nAs part of fighting climate change in our city, Pittsburgh\u2019s goal is to reduce energy and water consumption by 50% by 2030. This goal can be achieved through improving the quality of energy and water use data, ensuring all new buildings are carbon neutral, mitigating high energy burdens in vulnerable communities, reducing sewer volume by 50% from 2013 levels, and improving efficiency of public street lights and traffic signals. Chapter Three\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s goals are to reduce on-road transportation emissions by 50%, reduce vehicle miles traveled per capita by 50%, reduce freight emissions by 25%, and increase vehicle electrification. Through increasing walking and biking commutes, increasing Port Authority bus and light rail ridership, and expanding transit hubs, these goals can be achieved. Chapter Four\n\nPittsburgh strives to be zero-waste landfilled by 2030. By modernizing waste collection systems, improving education around waste diversion efforts, increasing composting, and enforcing waste policies, Pittsburgh can reach this goal. Chapter Five\n\nImproving local food systems in the Greater Pittsburgh area is a key piece of climate mitigation for the city. Increasing the supply and demand of local produce strengthens the local food system, increases local profitability, and decreases the climate impact of transportation and sales. Chapter Six\n\nUrban ecosystems\u2014cities, towns and urban strips constructed by humans\u2014impact the environment around them. Pittsburgh\u2019s goal is to increase tree canopy and biodiversity, improve urban soil conditions, prioritize habitat conversion, and implement guidelines for additional greenways. Chapter Seven\n\nPittsburgh has established six climate mitigation goals to achieve by 2030, including:\n\nPittsburgh is committed to:\n\nThrough leveraging grant funding and vehicle turnover cycles, the City of Pittsburgh has been purchasing alternatively fueled and hybrid vehicles for its fleet as technology becomes available. These vehicles incluse electric sedans for building inspectors, hybrid police vehicles, and CNG refuse trucks.

        "Question": "What was Pittsburgh known as in 1850 due to its industry?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "The Iron City",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century",
            "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]\n\nOther emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east\u2013west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the \"City of bridges\" over its two rivers.[citation needed] On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.[27]\n\nManufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18\u00a0m) in diameter and 80 feet (24\u00a0m) high.[33]\n\nLike many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.[34] Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.[31] As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side).[27] In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia."

            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first"

Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old \u201csoda jerk\u201d at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream \u2013 typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry \u2013 and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler\u2019s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as \u201cDr. Dave\u2019s\u201d among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split,\u00a0 \u201cIce-Cream Joe\u201d Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler\u2019s invention with the \u201cFrom Pitt Came the Split\u201d Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel\u2019s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler\n\nInside Strickler\u2019s Drug Store\n\nOutside Strickler\u2019s Drug Store\n\nPhotos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society\n\nHonorary Chair\n\nIce Cream Joe Gruble\n\nThe legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town\u2019s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the \u201cFrom Pitt Came the Split\u201d event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration\u2019s honorary chair. Stay up to date on the latest information."

Related Links\n\nRecent News\n\nGame Notes\n\nCaptain Sidney Crosby is heating up with five goals in his last six games. With his next tally, he will surpass Bobby Hull for 18th place on the NHL\u2019s all-time goals list. The forward\u2019s 1,045 total career assists are four shy of tying Gordie Howe for 10th place on the NHL\u2019s all-time assists list. Crosby is leading the charge for the Penguins with 59 points (18G-41A) on the season. The forward\n\nis just one point away from becoming the ninth player in NHL history to have 17 or more 60-point seasons, and only Washington\u2019s Alex Ovechkin (17) has more 60-point seasons than Crosby among active players. Crosby has historically been successful against the New York Rangers. In 87 career games versus the Rangers, Crosby has registered 40 goals, 68 assists and 108 points. Crosby\u2019s points-per-game average (1.24) against the Rangers is tied for 10th in NHL history (min. 25 GP), and no active player has more points versus New York than him. Crosby is currently the only active player in the NHL with 100-plus points against at least three franchises (New York Islanders, 136; Philadelphia, 133; NY Rangers, 108). Rickard Rakell has been having a career year with the Penguins, leading the team in goals (25) and ranks second in points (49). Rakell enters today\u2019s game just two points away from reaching 500 career NHL points. The forward is looking to become the 12th player from his 2011 draft class to reach 500 points and the third Swede to do it. Rakell, who is on an active six-game point streak (2G-5A) is looking to become the 12th active Swede to reach 500 points. Erik Karlsson is also on a six-game point streak, registering seven points (2G-5A) during this span. His point streak is currently tied for second in the NHL among defensemen. Karlsson leads all Pittsburgh defensemen and ranks fourth on the team with 39 points (6G-33A). The blueliner sits just one point away from surpassing Tomas Sandstrom for sole possession of 10th place on the all-time points list among Swedish players. Only Nicklas Lidstrom (1,142) has more points all-time among Swedish-born defensemen. Philip Tomasino notched his second multi-point outing of the year (2A) yesterday. The winger enters today\u2019s game with four points in his last five games (2G-2A) and only two Penguins have more points than him during February. On February 9, the Penguins claimed defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok (koh-lee-ah-CHOHN-ahk) off of waivers from the Utah Hockey Club. The 23-year-old defenseman is signed through the 2025-26 season and has posted five points (2G-3A) in 23 games this season. The native of Minsk, Belarus was originally a second-round pick (52nd overall) of the Florida Panthers in 2019 and has spent the past four seasons between the NHL and AHL. In 62 career NHL games, he\u2019s recorded 12 points (4G-8A) and one game-winning goal. Kolyachonok also has 150 games at the AHL level split between Tucson and Syracuse, where he\u2019s picked up 48 points (13G-35A) and is plus-12. Quick Hits\n\n1) Tonight, the Penguins conclude their 12th set of back-to-back games. Thus far, the team is 9-14-0 in back-to-backs (3-9-0 on the first night and 6-5-0 on the second night). 2) Philip Tomasino has points in five of his six career games versus the Rangers (4G-1A). 3) Kevin Hayes has three points (1G-2A) over his last four games and has points in back-to-back home games (1G-1A). 4) Anthony Beauvillier has 26 points (13G-13A) in 33 career games against New York.

Meet the Penguins\n\nAs part of the Penguins Pledge, and in partnership with the National Aviary, Aviary experts and some of their live penguin ambassadors will visit PPG Paints Arena for tonight's game.

        "<Generated>Answer": "Iron City",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century",
            "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]\n\nGeography of industrialization\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]\n\nA further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]\n\nBy about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]\n\nMachine politics\n\nChristopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]\n\nGermans\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]\n\nLabor unions"

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933\u2013present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season . [ 21 ] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969 , Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970 , Jack Ham in 1971 , Franco Harris in 1972 , [ 22 ] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann , Jack Lambert , John Stallworth , Donnie Shell and Mike Webster .

The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.

This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger . The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the \" Steagles \"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag . The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \" Steelmark \", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland -based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three astroids ( hypocycloids of four cusps ). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel. [ 100 ] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. [ 101 ] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants , are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968 . The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997 , the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ( Futura Condensed ) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007\u20132011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007 . They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963 \u2013 1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season . The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season. [ 102 ] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed. [ 103 ] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then- Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. [ 104 ] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw . Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors. Rivals The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: ( Cleveland Browns , Baltimore Ravens , and Cincinnati Bengals ). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders , Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , New England Patriots , and Tennessee Titans . They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles , but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Divisional rivals Cleveland Browns Main article: Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9\u201331 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66\u201327\u20131 (including 42\u20136 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75\u201358\u20131; [ 108 ] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL"

            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century",
            "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]\n\nGeography of industrialization\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]\n\nA further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]\n\nBy about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]\n\nMachine politics\n\nChristopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]\n\nGermans\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]\n\nLabor unions"

        "<Generated>Answer": "Pittsburgh",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "In 1986, UPMC announced a $230\u00a0million ($660\u00a0million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public\u2014cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[272] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[273]\n\nThe $80\u00a0million ($146\u00a0million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30\u00a0million ($53.3\u00a0million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq.",
            "ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420\u00a0million ($699\u00a0million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2009, the $600\u00a0million ($876\u00a0million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[274] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[275] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[276]\n\nHealth discoveries\n\nWhile he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955. UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[277] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[278][279]\n\nThe Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[280]\n\nTransportation\n\nPittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[281] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges\".[282] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[283]\n\nPublic transportation statistics\n\nPittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9\u00a0mi (6.3\u00a0km), while 11% travel for over 7.5\u00a0mi (12\u00a0km) in a single direction.[284]\n\nExpressways and highways\n\nLocals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon\u2013Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region. Airports\n\nPittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71\u00a0km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127\u00a0km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown\u2013Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130\u00a0km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron\u2013Canton Airport (120 miles (190\u00a0km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown\u2013Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97\u00a0km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198\u00a0km) north of Pittsburgh). Intercity passenger rail and bus\n\nAmtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City. Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[285]\n\nUntil declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station. Regional mass transit\n\nPittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[286] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[287] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[288] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares. The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook. Freight rail"

            "Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott. Regional identity\n\nPittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia. Climate\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[73]\n\nThe warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2\u00a0\u00b0F (22.9\u00a0\u00b0C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C), and lows of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230\u00a0\u00b0C), on January 19, 1994 to 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is \u22123\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006\u00a0mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65\u00a0in (575\u00a0mm) in 1930 to 57.83\u00a0in (1,469\u00a0mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112\u00a0cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8\u00a0in (22\u00a0cm) in 1918\u201319 to 80\u00a0in (200\u00a0cm) in 1950\u201351.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%). Air quality\n\nThe American Lung Association's 2024 \"State of the Air\" report, covering data from 2020 to 2022, indicated that while Pittsburgh's air quality is poor, it is improving. The city ranked 26th for short-term particle pollution, earning an F grade, and 19th for year-round particle pollution. It received a D grade for ozone pollution, ranking 50th for ozone smog.[81][82] However, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[83][84]\n\nDespite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[85] It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[85] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[86]\n\nAs of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[87]\n\nWater quality\n\nLocal rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[88] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[89] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[90][91] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[92] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[93][94][95]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[96][97][98] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[99][100][101] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[102] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[102]\n\nThere remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.[103] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[103][104]\n\nDemographics\n\nAt the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010,[108] compared to 78.7% in 1970.[109] By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[107] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.",
            "The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49]\n\nIn September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50]\n\nGeography\n\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\u00a0km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144\u00a0km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\u00a0km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential."

        "<Generated>Answer": "Bill Mazeroski",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season . Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960 . They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees , yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente , the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971 . Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass . In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. [ 16 ] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970 , 1971 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 , and 1979 . Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell , Dave Parker , and Al Oliver , the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990. The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , and Doug Drabek . The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992 . Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. Andrew McCutchen , 2012 With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park , did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen , defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game . They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals . That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. [ 17 ] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th [ 18 ] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies , Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs . [ 19 ] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Ballpark [ edit ] Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium , a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. [ 20 ] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services . [ 21 ] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game , when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130. PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; [ 26 ] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, [ 27 ] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente , who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell , Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge , or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station , located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. Former ballparks [ edit ] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park , located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park , which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete",
            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first"

            "by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan , who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. [ 46 ] This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Crosby with the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade. The team won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in 2016 . The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs , the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4\u20131 series, the Capitals 4\u20132 and the Lightning 4\u20133 to win the Eastern Conference championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks . [ 49 ] On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4\u20132 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. [ 50 ] The Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. [ 51 ] The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs , defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the conference finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals , where they faced the Nashville Predators . The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997\u201398 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era. [ 6 ] Patric Hornqvist celebrates the 2017 Stanley Cup -clinching goal against the Nashville Predators . Playoff streak (2017\u20132023) Before the 2017\u201318 season , the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL expansion draft to the Vegas Golden Knights . [ 52 ] Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. [ 53 ] In the next season , the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round. [ 54 ] In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic , the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs , but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round. [ 55 ] On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1,000 NHL games for the team. [ 58 ] The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. [ 59 ] This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs . [ 60 ] The 2020\u201321 season came to an end in game 6 of the first round of the 2021 playoffs against the New York Islanders. [ 61 ] On November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. [ 62 ] On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins. [ 63 ] In the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs , the Penguins lost in seven games to the New York Rangers despite having a 3\u20131 series lead. The game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6\u20130 the previous six instances. [ 64 ] The 2022\u201323 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform. [ 65 ] This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. [ 66 ] However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005\u201306, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in dismissals of Burke and Hextall. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Dubas era (2023\u2013present) On June 1, 2023, Kyle Dubas was named the team's new president of hockey operations. [ 69 ] On August 6, the Penguins traded for Norris Trophy -winning defenseman Erik Karlsson in a three-team deal also involving the Montreal Canadiens . [ 70 ] On February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favorite forward Jake Guentzel , trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes . [ 71 ] Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season When the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers , clinching the final spot as the second wild card. [ 72 ] Team information Crest and sweater design When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. [ 73 ] The team's colors were originally powder blue , navy blue , and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, [ 74 ] beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city. [ 73 ] The Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983\u201384 season. [ 73 ] In the 1992\u201393 season , the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo, or \"Robopenguin\". [ 75 ] [ 76 ] The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995,",
            ", Allegheny County chief executive Dan Onorato , Pittsburgh's mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center , guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040. [ 35 ] After a mediocre start to the 2007\u201308 season , Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title \u2013 their first division title in 10 years \u2013 with a 4\u20132 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy . The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4\u20130, defeating the New York Rangers 4\u20131 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20131 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy . Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14\u20136 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe Trophy -winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead. Crosby, Bill Guerin , and Chris Kunitz during the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals . The Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals, earning their third Stanley Cup title. In the 2008\u201309 season , Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in Detroit , like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2\u20131 to win their third Stanley Cup title. [ 36 ] Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. [ 11 ] During the 2009\u201310 season , Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive game 7, which the Penguins lost 5\u20132, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena. [ 37 ] New arena and injuries (2010\u20132015) Outside of Consol Energy Center (now PPG Paints Arena) in March 2010 before it officially opened. The Penguins hosted the Washington Capitals at Heinz Field during the 2011 Winter Classic . In 2010\u201311 , the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center . On February 11, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2013New York Islanders brawl took place. [ 38 ] A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning , with Fleury's goaltending called into question. [ 39 ] With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome , at the start of the 2011\u201312 season , Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. [ 40 ] Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award . Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL entry draft for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] During the lockout -shortened 2012\u201313 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the conference finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million. [ 43 ] On July 1, 2015, the Penguins acquired right-winger Phil Kessel in a multi-player deal. In the 2013\u201314 season , the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division , though the club struggled in the playoffs , requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets , then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford , the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. [ 44 ] Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014\u201315 season , the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps , the team fell to fourth in the division. The Penguins lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel . [ 45 ] Back-to-back Stanley Cups and 50th anniversary (2015\u20132017) After acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015\u201316 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan , who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. [ 46 ] This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Crosby with the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade. The team won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in 2016 . The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points.

            "Cookie List\n\nURL: https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-feb-11-x8655\n\nCONTENT:\n\nAsked and Answered\n\nAsked and Answered: Feb. 11\n\nSteelers.com\n\nLet's get to it:\n\nROBERT YEAGER FROM CANYON COUNTRY, CA: With all the popular options of alternative uniforms in the NFL, have the Steelers ever thought about honoring the gold shoulder pad uniforms? I thought those were very cool/different than other NFL uniforms of the day. ANSWER: I am not privy to the conversations/decisions about selecting a throwback jersey for a particular season, but the uniforms you reference certainly were unique and part of my early memories of the Steelers and the NFL. The following is something I wrote for Steelers.com about the origin of those uniforms and their brief history with the franchise:\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Green Bay Packers were the National Football League's dominant team. They had won championships in 1961, 1962, 1965 and 1966, and they had played for the title in 1960. In that respect, every NFL team wanted to be like the Packers. Dan Rooney might have wanted the Steelers to win like the Packers, but he didn't necessarily want them to look like the Green Bay Packers. In early 1966, the Steelers players had an executive committee that would meet with ownership about issues that concerned them. At that time, one of the issues was the uniform. John Campbell, a linebacker going into his second season with the team, was on the executive committee, and he was the one who asked Dan Rooney to do something about the uniform. Mindful of how many teams were morphing into Packers look-a-likes, Dan Rooney decided to make an attempt at something distinctive. That also was the time when the City of Pittsburgh was trying to remake its image, trying to get away from the perception of a dirty, smoky city. One of the areas being refurbished was Downtown, called the \"Golden Triangle\" because that was the shape of the land created by the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers flowing into the Ohio River. Dan Rooney decided to incorporate this unique bit of the city's geography into the Steelers new uniforms, and that's how the triangle design came to be a part of the jersey. The triangle was always gold, with the rest of the home jersey being black with white numbers and the road jersey being white with black numbers. But if the intent of linking the team to its city was a nice idea, the practical execution of it didn't always go smoothly. For example, washing the uniforms. In 1966, the Steelers preseason finale was against the Cleveland Browns in Birmingham, Ala., and they were to wear the black jerseys with the gold triangles, because the Browns always preferred to wear their white jerseys. But in laundering the Steelers' jerseys, the black bled into the gold triangles and created an aesthetic mess. And then, not everyone was able to make the connection between the Steelers' jerseys and Pittsburgh's geography. Midway through the 1966 season, the Steelers were set to play a game against the Cowboys in Dallas on Oct. 30. Like the Browns, the Cowboys always preferred to wear white jerseys, and so the Steelers were outfitted in their black jerseys with the gold triangles. Shortly before kickoff, Dan Rooney appeared on the Cowboys pregame radio show to promote the matchup and he was asked, \"Are your wearing those uniforms because tomorrow is Halloween?\"\n\nAnd so following the 1967 season, the Steelers \"retired\" their golden triangle jerseys for good, but they still remain an interesting part of the franchise's rich history. MARK THOMPSON FROM HUNTINGTON, WV: Please tell me if this is true."

Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. Our Story\n\nThe Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center\u2019s collections. The Historical Society brought our region\u2019s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region\u2019s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region\u2019s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region\u2019s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members\u2019 homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania\u2019s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh\u2019s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum\u2019s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. Heinz History Center\n\nAs Pittsburgh\u2019s \u201cpeople museum,\u201d the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood\u201d and the world\u2019s oldest jeep. Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum\n\nThe Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center\u2019s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions. From football to baseball and hockey to golf, the Sports Museum highlights the region\u2019s passion for amateur and professional sports. Fort Pitt Museum\n\nThe Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that presents the story of Western Pennsylvania\u2019s essential role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh. Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village\n\nMeadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America, is located in Avella, Washington County, Pa. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a National Historic Landmark, features 19,000-year-old evidence of the region\u2019s earliest inhabitants under a massive rock overhang. In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years. Detre Library & Archives\n\nMore than 250 years of our region\u2019s history can be found at the Thomas and Katherine Detre Library & Archives.

            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first",
            "first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season . Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960 . They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees , yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente , the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971 . Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass . In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. [ 16 ] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970 , 1971 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 , and 1979 . Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell , Dave Parker , and Al Oliver , the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990. The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , and Doug Drabek . The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992 . Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. Andrew McCutchen , 2012 With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park , did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen , defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game . They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals . That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. [ 17 ] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th [ 18 ] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies , Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs . [ 19 ] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Ballpark [ edit ] Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium , a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. [ 20 ] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services . [ 21 ] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game , when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130. PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; [ 26 ] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, [ 27 ] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente , who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell , Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge , or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station , located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. Former ballparks [ edit ] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park , located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park , which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete"

            "\u201cThere are photos from the unveiling where there are people shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d says Lamanna. Back in Pittsburgh, big things were in the works. \u201cMultiple sources cite the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and Carnegie\u2019s desire to display its mounted skeleton as a major driving force behind the construction of an expanded Carnegie Institute building,\u201d says Lamanna. In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall. Diplodocus carnegii finally had a forever home. \u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d says Tom Rea, author of Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Dinosaur . The display of real fossils\u2014not just casts\u2014is what made it momentous, explains Rea. Before long, word of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus spread like wildfire. And everybody wanted a piece. Dippy\u2019s World Tour\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the largest and most respected museums in the world were only just beginning to catch dino-fever. \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing time in science when you think about it,\u201d says Rea. \u201cThese were all temples of science,\u201d adds Rea, who is also editor and founder of WyoHistory.org, a project of the Wyoming Historical Society. \u201cThese big halls, with high ceilings and dramatic arches, and daylight coming down through the clerestory, and all that stuff that makes these spaces so fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nBut most of them had nothing like a Diplodocus . So when requests started to pour in from abroad, Carnegie again seized the moment. Before long, casts would be sent to some of the largest cities in the world. According to Rea, Berlin erected its Diplodocus cast in March 1908. Paris followed suit that June. The following year, Vienna and Bologna joined the trend, and then St. Petersburg in 1910, La Plata, Argentina, in 1912, Madrid in 1913, and Mexico City in 1930. For the vast majority of museumgoers of the day, it would be the first dinosaur they\u2019d ever laid eyes upon. \u201cThe cool thing about that is, most of these casts are still on display,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cWhen you think about all the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people that see Diplodocus carnegii casts every year in all these European cities, in Latin [and South] America, and couple that with the fact that these mounts have been on display in many cases for more than a century,\u201d says Lamanna, \u201cthis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nThe House That Dippy Built\n\nNo one is quite sure who first coined \u201cDippy\u201d as the nickname for Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus . \u201cI can tell you that the fossil preparator Arthur Coggeshall used the nickname in three articles he wrote in Carnegie magazine about the discovery and fame of D. carnegii in September, October, and November 1951,\u201d says Rea. Coggeshall had been connected to the museum for more than half a century at that point. In fact, he was on the original expedition in Wyoming when Dippy was discovered. Nieuwland adds that Coggeshall\u2019s boss, Holland, referred to the Diplodocus as \u201cOld Dip,\u201d but not Dippy. The one thing we do know is that pretty much as soon as the casts of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus started stomping around the world, some scientists took issue with how the mount stood. This was due, in part, to a notion of the day that dinosaurs would have stood like modern-day lizards and crocodiles\u2014low to the ground, with tail in tow and legs sprawled widely apart. But Holland, who started his career as a butterfly expert before doubling as the museum\u2019s paleontologist, contended in 1910 that the legs of Diplodocus held the animal higher off the ground, more like a mammal. \u201cUltimately, Holland\u2019s argument was proven correct,\u201d says Lamanna, who cites the subsequent discovery of fossilized sauropod trackways showing that the feet were placed close together as the deciding factor. \u201cAnd now everyone that knows or cares at all about sauropods reconstructs them with their legs underneath their bodies, like an elephant.\u201d\n\nMore changes came over time\u2014and some of them quite recently. Lamanna arrived at the museum in 2004 and at the time, the tail of Diplodocus carnegii still lay upon the ground. Worse still, it nearly touched the feet of a T. rex , a dinosaur that humans are closer to in time than Diplodocus would have been. \u201cSo this was wrong on two levels,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cFirst of all, the dinosaur\u2019s tail probably didn\u2019t touch the ground very much, if at all. And secondly, having the tail lap against the ankles of a 66-million-year-old dinosaur \u2026 I mean, you might as well have had a caveman riding the T. rex .\u201d\n\nGetting Dippy\u2019s tail off the ground\u2014and away from T. rex \u2014was just one of many changes that went into the creation of the museum\u2019s Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition, which opened in 2008 in a space triple the size of the original Dinosaur Hall. Among other changes, Lamanna and his colleagues also switched the bones in Dippy\u2019s forelimbs and added vertebrae in its tail, in keeping with the latest research. Elsewhere in the exhibition, scientists, artists, and fossil preparators transformed formerly two-dimensional fossils into three-dimensional works of art, including Dryosaurus elderae, Camptosaurus aphanoecetes , and Corythosaurus casuarius . Similarly, real fossil heads of Edmontosaurus regalis and Triceratops prorsus received cast bodies, bringing them to life. And it\u2019s not just the mounts, says Lamanna. The team has also worked to surround the dinos with plants, rocks, smaller animals, and other facets of the ecosystems they would have once inhabited to create a more immersive visitor experience. Of the roughly 230 objects now on display in Dinosaurs in Their Time , about 75 percent are real fossils, not casts, making this one of the most impressive paleontological exhibitions on Earth. Dippy: Teacher And Celebrity\n\nOf course, in paleontology, there will always be questions we can\u2019t answer. For instance, scientists have yet to find a Diplodocus carnegii head, meaning the one sported by Dippy currently is a cast of a skull of the related species Diplodocus longus . And remember, Dippy is already a composite skeleton\u2014meaning it\u2019s made up of multiple specimens. Lamanna\u2014who has helped discover and name much larger sauropods known as titanosaurs\u2014says that Dippy was the bedrock on which so much future paleontology would be built. \u201c Diplodocus is one of our first windows into sauropod biology,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe appearance, behavior, lifestyle, evolutionary relationships; when we do research on sauropods today, in a lot of ways we\u2019re standing on the shoulders of the people that did research on Diplodocus back in the day, and also Diplodocus itself.\u201d\n\nThe museum has also fully embraced Dippy\u2019s celebrity\u2014placing the dino in its logo and stationing a full-bodied gelcoat and fiberglass replica outside on Forbes Avenue. These days, the outdoor Dippy may be the one that gets the most attention, on account of its ever-changing accessories.",
            "Strong winds kicked up swirls of dust, which got everywhere\u2014in tents, in sleeping bags, in socks. Everyone wore ski goggles. Gabriel Casal (right) and Matt Lamanna (center) make a protective plaster and burlap jacket around several bones of the new titanosaur skeleton at the Estancia Laguna Palacios. On the first day of the R\u00edo Chico dig, two Argentinian students unearthed a Cretaceous-aged mammal fossil, the only one ever found in the region. The students, Noelia Cardozo and Ivanna Mora, have been training in the lab led by paleontologists Gabriel Casal, Lucio Ibiricu, and Andrea De Sosa Tomas. The unassuming fossil was an upper jawbone of a rodent-sized mammal containing at least four tiny teeth. The whole fossil is only about the width of a thumbnail. It belongs to a now-extinct mammal called a meridiolestidan. During this time, mammals lived in the shadows of larger dinosaurs and so mostly remained comparatively small in size, Lamanna notes. Sharing those discoveries with the rest of the world, even as the team was finding them, was Kara Fikse\u2019s job. Fikse, director of donor engagement and stewardship at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, documented the journey and facilitated live video streams viewed by hundreds of people across the U.S., Canada, France, and Australia. Kara Fikse\n\nThe aim was to give the public a behind-the-scenes view of what it was like to be a dinosaur scientist. She said that witnessing it firsthand was striking. \u201cEveryone\u2019s face was streaked with dirt, everyone was just genuinely excited to be working together out there in the field,\u201d Fikse recollects. \u201cAnd from the scientific aspect, whenever they found something, that sort of emotion of excitement and passion for the work they were doing was pretty contagious.\u201d\n\nIt was all a new experience for Linsly Church, curatorial assistant for vertebrate paleontology at the Museum of Natural History. \u201cThis was an exciting opportunity to go on my first expedition and my first trip to Argentina,\u201d Church says. \u201cI was looking forward to learning more about how fossils are found, stabilized, and removed from the ground. It was a great experience and I got to meet and work with so many wonderful people!\u201d\n\nMatt Lamanna and Linsly Church\n\nDuring the expedition she learned to apply plaster-soaked burlap strips over the fossils to protect them when they were uncovered, and helped to dig the trenches needed in order to extract each bone. At the R\u00edo Chico, she found a toe bone of another new megaraptorid species that had been previously found at the site. It was one of many discoveries, including parts of duck-billed dinosaurs and turtles, that made the expedition so successful. The new mammal fossil discovered by the Argentinian students was especially groundbreaking. \u201cBy itself, this fossil would\u2019ve made our expedition a smashing success,\u201d Lamanna exclaims. \u201cThe fact that we also found parts of four different dinosaur species put it totally over the top.\u201d\n\nInternational Collaboration\n\nFinding a dinosaur bone in the ground is only the first step in what is often a years-long journey in understanding what a fossil is and where it fits into the broader record of life on Earth. This long and arduous adventure of fossil study and preservation begins in the lab. In the middle of their Patagonia trip, the team decamped to the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia. There, Lamanna and his Argentinian collaborators, including Lucio Ibiricu, study discoveries from the field. Lamanna (left) and fossil preparator Marcelo Luna in the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia. \u201cWe share a lot of ideas about papers and projects, so we are going to continue in this line,\u201d Ibiricu says. \u201cWe are sure that we are going to continue working with Matt for several years, sharing field seasons, papers, projects, and hopefully sharing students to increase their experience.\u201d\n\nAs investments in paleontology labs and student training in Argentina continue to grow, more discoveries will follow. \u201cBy working together, the scientific impact we can make is potentially very significant,\u201d Lamanna says. Because of how Earth has evolved, Cretaceous dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere are usually quite different from their northern counterparts, having evolved along separate evolutionary pathways for tens of millions of years after the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. Most of the field team that worked in the R\u00edo Chico headwaters area."

It is in the Allegheny Center neighborhood in Pittsburgh's Northside . History [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh was founded in 1983 in the old Allegheny Post Office , gifted to the museum by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , and is situated on Pittsburgh's North Side, formerly Allegheny City . The neighboring Buhl Planetarium building was vacated by 1991 when it was superseded by the nearby Kamin Science Center . The museum grew from a traveling mobile museum started at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in 1972, and was part of the first wave of children's museums spreading across the country at that time. [ 3 ] New building [ edit ] In the early 2000s, it was announced the museum would be expanding from the old Beaux Arts -style post office into the neighboring vacant Art Deco Buhl Planetarium. A plan was devised by Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc. to connect the two historic structures with a modern glass addition over what was a street called Allegheny Square. The street was vacated and realigned and the addition was built. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh became the largest Silver LEED certified museum in the country in March 2006. This validates that the museum's expansion has been designed and constructed using sustainable practices with particular attention to site development, water conservation, energy management, using recycled materials, waste management, reusing resources, indoor air quality as well as developing new programs for visitors. To offer teaching moments about the new green museum , many of the building's structural and mechanical systems are left exposed. Buhl Community Park [ edit ] In 2010, officials announced plans to rehab a rundown park in front of the museum. The centerpiece of the new park will be a fog sculpture by Ned Kahn . The park opened on June 23, 2012, during a community celebration. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Grounds [ edit ] In its seasonal \"Backyard\", [ 6 ] the museum grounds includes an interactive environment called \"Allegheny Waterworks\" which incorporates preserved local architectural relics. [ 7 ] A garden on the grounds once displayed sculptures of Guyasuta , Christopher Gist and others, designed by sculptor Charles Keck and rescued from the Manchester Bridge when it was razed in 1970. The garden was removed in the 2000s to make room for more parking. The Guyasuta and Gist sculptures have been reinstalled near Stage AE in the North Shore neighborhood. [ 8 ] Exhibits [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh houses several ongoing exhibits as well as rotating exhibits. The MAKESHOP, Kindness Gallery, Studio, Backyard, Garage, Garden, Theater, Waterplay, and Nursery areas are ongoing interactive exhibits and encourage touch and play. [ 9 ] Also located within the museum are iconic items from the show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . These include the original puppets, one of Fred Rogers ' sweaters, and his sneakers. [ 10 ] Programs [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh presents a wide variety of programs for children in fields ranging from dance and rocket building to quilting and robotics. Visiting artists offer workshops in a host of media, including pottery, Japanese paper cutting, animation and painting. The museum's extensive outreach program offers performances, workshops, after school programs, artist days and festival programs for schools and groups throughout the year. Educational field trips are offered for local schools, scouts and other groups. The museum has collaborated with a number of regional institutions and programs, such as the University of Pittsburgh and the Create a Comic Project . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Awards [ edit ] The former Buhl Planetarium building is now part of the Children's Museum The addition has received numerous awards, including a 2009 National Medal for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services , National Trust for Historic Preservation award, LEED silver certification, and an award from American Institute of Architects. Children's Museum Executive Director Jane Werner received the Green Building Alliance [ 13 ] 2006 Shades of Green Leadership Award which celebrates leaders who have helped transform the Pittsburgh region into a more sustainable place to live and work. Werner's contributions cited include launching a new program/initiative supporting green-building related activities; raising significant community awareness and outreach of green issues through materials, programs and events; and influencing the adoption of a program/policy through advocacy efforts and implementing green management and operation policies within the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh.

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933\u2013present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season . [ 21 ] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969 , Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970 , Jack Ham in 1971 , Franco Harris in 1972 , [ 22 ] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann , Jack Lambert , John Stallworth , Donnie Shell and Mike Webster .

Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of\n\nFinance and is composed of the following accounts:\n\nDebt Service\n\n82101  Interest Expense - Bonds\n\n82103  Principal\n\nBudget Creation Process\n\nThe operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget\n\n(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations,\n\npolicy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by\n\nCity Code. After receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit\n\nproposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements,\n\nrequests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the\n\nproposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if\n\nany, should be funded. The Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to\n\ngarner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor\u2019s\n\nstrategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November. City Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After\n\nconsideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a\n\nvote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st. Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of\n\nthe new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to\n\ncollective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before\n\nDecember 31st was 1931. Upon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Operating and\n\nCapital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City\u2019s expenditures and revenues, provides\n\nlegislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments. Analysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure\n\ncategories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important\n\nmanagement initiatives. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\n\nFiscal Year 2024\n\nBudget Guide\n\n26\n\nFive-Year Financial Forecast\n\nIn addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both\n\nexpenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise\n\nthe five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document. The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This\n\naids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-\n\nterm impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for\n\nlong-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might\n\nresult in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus\n\nensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh. Revenue Forecast\n\nRevenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and\n\ndeliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the\n\nrights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections. The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts. Previous years\u2019 financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-\n\nyear financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City\u2019s enterprise resource planning\n\n(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue\n\nline. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line. In addition to the previous years\u2019 financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic\n\nvariables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue\n\ngenerating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the\n\nNational Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs. Revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are\n\ndeveloped in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are\n\nreasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections\n\nare finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast. Expenditure Forecast\n\nOMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these\n\nforecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known\n\nexpenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension",

Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old \u201csoda jerk\u201d at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream \u2013 typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry \u2013 and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler\u2019s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as \u201cDr. Dave\u2019s\u201d among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split,\u00a0 \u201cIce-Cream Joe\u201d Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler\u2019s invention with the \u201cFrom Pitt Came the Split\u201d Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel\u2019s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler\n\nInside Strickler\u2019s Drug Store\n\nOutside Strickler\u2019s Drug Store\n\nPhotos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society\n\nHonorary Chair\n\nIce Cream Joe Gruble\n\nThe legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town\u2019s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the \u201cFrom Pitt Came the Split\u201d event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration\u2019s honorary chair. Stay up to date on the latest information.",

            "by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan , who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. [ 46 ] This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Crosby with the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade. The team won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in 2016 . The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs , the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4\u20131 series, the Capitals 4\u20132 and the Lightning 4\u20133 to win the Eastern Conference championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks . [ 49 ] On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4\u20132 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. [ 50 ] The Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. [ 51 ] The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs , defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the conference finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals , where they faced the Nashville Predators . The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997\u201398 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era. [ 6 ] Patric Hornqvist celebrates the 2017 Stanley Cup -clinching goal against the Nashville Predators . Playoff streak (2017\u20132023) Before the 2017\u201318 season , the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL expansion draft to the Vegas Golden Knights . [ 52 ] Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. [ 53 ] In the next season , the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round. [ 54 ] In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic , the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs , but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round. [ 55 ] On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1,000 NHL games for the team. [ 58 ] The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. [ 59 ] This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs . [ 60 ] The 2020\u201321 season came to an end in game 6 of the first round of the 2021 playoffs against the New York Islanders. [ 61 ] On November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. [ 62 ] On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins. [ 63 ] In the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs , the Penguins lost in seven games to the New York Rangers despite having a 3\u20131 series lead. The game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6\u20130 the previous six instances. [ 64 ] The 2022\u201323 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform. [ 65 ] This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. [ 66 ] However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005\u201306, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in dismissals of Burke and Hextall. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Dubas era (2023\u2013present) On June 1, 2023, Kyle Dubas was named the team's new president of hockey operations. [ 69 ] On August 6, the Penguins traded for Norris Trophy -winning defenseman Erik Karlsson in a three-team deal also involving the Montreal Canadiens . [ 70 ] On February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favorite forward Jake Guentzel , trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes . [ 71 ] Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season When the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers , clinching the final spot as the second wild card. [ 72 ] Team information Crest and sweater design When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. [ 73 ] The team's colors were originally powder blue , navy blue , and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, [ 74 ] beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city. [ 73 ] The Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983\u201384 season. [ 73 ] In the 1992\u201393 season , the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo, or \"Robopenguin\". [ 75 ] [ 76 ] The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995,",
            ", Allegheny County chief executive Dan Onorato , Pittsburgh's mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center , guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040. [ 35 ] After a mediocre start to the 2007\u201308 season , Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title \u2013 their first division title in 10 years \u2013 with a 4\u20132 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy . The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4\u20130, defeating the New York Rangers 4\u20131 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20131 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy . Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14\u20136 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe Trophy -winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead. Crosby, Bill Guerin , and Chris Kunitz during the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals . The Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals, earning their third Stanley Cup title. In the 2008\u201309 season , Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in Detroit , like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2\u20131 to win their third Stanley Cup title. [ 36 ] Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. [ 11 ] During the 2009\u201310 season , Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive game 7, which the Penguins lost 5\u20132, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena. [ 37 ] New arena and injuries (2010\u20132015) Outside of Consol Energy Center (now PPG Paints Arena) in March 2010 before it officially opened. The Penguins hosted the Washington Capitals at Heinz Field during the 2011 Winter Classic . In 2010\u201311 , the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center . On February 11, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2013New York Islanders brawl took place. [ 38 ] A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning , with Fleury's goaltending called into question. [ 39 ] With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome , at the start of the 2011\u201312 season , Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. [ 40 ] Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award . Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL entry draft for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] During the lockout -shortened 2012\u201313 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the conference finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million. [ 43 ] On July 1, 2015, the Penguins acquired right-winger Phil Kessel in a multi-player deal. In the 2013\u201314 season , the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division , though the club struggled in the playoffs , requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets , then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford , the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. [ 44 ] Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014\u201315 season , the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps , the team fell to fourth in the division. The Penguins lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel . [ 45 ] Back-to-back Stanley Cups and 50th anniversary (2015\u20132017) After acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015\u201316 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan , who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. [ 46 ] This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Crosby with the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade. The team won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in 2016 . The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season.

Many of our Paramedics have also obtained certification through the National Registry of EMTs gaining them certification as a Nationally Registered Paramedic. New Paramedics and EMTs are also instructed through a joint effort between Pittsburgh EMS and the Center for Emergency Medicine. Training to become a Paramedic requires thousands of hours of preparation, dedication and hard work. Paramedics are constantly updating themselves and the equipment and skills required to perform at their best. It is the role of the Training Division to keep the Paramedics prepared for whatever they may encounter. Paramedics of Pittsburgh EMS continue their education and maintaining certification by attending a minimum of 24 hours of continuing education classes each year. To ensure that every Paramedic receives annual training, the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services developed the EMS Training Division to handle the task of education. The division consists of three Paramedic Crew Chiefs assigned as training officers to handle the workload. In addition, other field personnel with specialized training are brought into the Division as needed to assist in training subjects that are not part of everyday, routine operations. There are also many Paramedic Crew Chiefs trained as Field Training Officers to assist in the hands-on training that is given to many Paramedic students, emergency physician residents, RNs and so on. Many of our Paramedics are certified as instructors and evaluators in a wide range of related Public Safety disciplines. These include Emergency Medicine, Rescue, Hazardous Materials and more. These Pittsburgh Paramedics routinely share their knowledge and skills with responders from throughout Pennsylvania and, indeed, the entire nation. Many of our personnel are among the most sought after technical instructors in their fields of expertise. The Training Division also provides a range of educational opportunities to other City bureaus and departments as well as the public at large. The Training Division assists in facilitating CPR/AED (automatic external defibrillator) classes for other City of Pittsburgh departments and neighborhood groups. The Training Division also teaches the First Responder program for all of the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers and recruits. City of Pittsburgh Paramedics receive their medical direction/command through the Center for Emergency Medicine and work under the guidance of our Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth. We also share a unique relationship with the University of Pittsburgh's affiliated Residency in Emergency Medicine which, on select calls, allows for an emergency physician to respond to the scene of an emergency.

It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist. [ 4 ] The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol . The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute , the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWFVA). [ 5 ] Warhol Self Portrait Exhibit in 2010 The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot (8,200\u00a0m 2 ) facility on seven floors. Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget (2010) was $6.1 million. In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996. [ 6 ] History [ edit ] Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989, [ 7 ] about 2\u00bd years after Warhol's death. At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated $80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation. [ 7 ] Thomas N. Armstrong III , who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993. [ 8 ] Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work. [ 9 ] By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot (8,200\u00a0m 2 ) industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about $12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over $55 million, [ 8 ] a donation that grew to about 3,000 works. [ 4 ] On May 13\u201314, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend. [ 4 ] Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening; at the time of his resignation, the museum had had \"tense relations\" with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation. [ 4 ] On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum. [ 10 ] In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan , New York City , in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side , an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex. [ 16 ] In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed , based on Warhol's 1975 book, \u201c The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again \u201d, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh. [ 17 ] In 2022, the museum announced a $60 million expansion deemed The 'Pop District' covering six blocks in Pittsburgh, PA. The expansion looks to build a music venue, a social media studio called Warhol Creative, and expand places for public art exhibits. [ 18 ] The proposed site would be around 58,000 square feet (17,500 square meters), including a first-floor concert venue with standing room for up to 1,000 people, a second-floor mezzanine, and an events space that could hold up to 360 people on the fourth floor. The third floor would be used for offices and support spaces. [ 19 ] The project is expected to take ten years and is funded primarily through local foundations. [ 20 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Display of Interview magazine covers The 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event. The film's subject was hosting the event. The Andy Warhol Diaries (TV series) in 2022 prominently featured museum staff as narrators of Warhol's life.

            "Hillman Fund \u00a9 Kerry James Marshall. Courtesy the artist and David Zwirner, London\n\nUntitled (Gallery) by Kerry James Marshall\n\nConsidered one of the greatest living painters in America, Kerry James Marshall is best known for reinserting Black figures into the largely white historical canon of Western painting. For Eric Crosby, the Henry J. Heinz II Director of Carnegie Museum of Art, he was the artist who got away. Although Marshall exhibited a far-out comic strip populated by a cast of Black heroes in the 1999 Carnegie International , the museum had failed to acquire his work. When Crosby joined the museum as a curator in 2015, he was determined to right that wrong, and in December 2016 the museum did just that by purchasing a new painting by Marshall. In Untitled ( Gallery ), the juxtaposition of the primary figure and the nearby photograph on the wall prompts a host of questions, Crosby writes: \u201cIs the subject of the painting also the subject of the photograph? Is she the artist? The curator? Or perhaps the gallerist? Is she the owner of the artwork or just an interested viewer? If Marshall\u2019s goal has been to bring the Black figure emphatically into the field of art, and indeed into the museum, then Untitled ( Gallery ) takes this aim directly as its primary subject matter.\u201d\n\nOakland Muses\n\nThanks to sculptor John Massey Rhind, the Forbes Avenue entrances to Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Museums in Oakland are hard to miss. That\u2019s because they feature the larger-than-life bronze statues of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Bach, and Galileo\u2014the personification of the literature, art, music, and science found within. But often overlooked are the 12 muses who stand 12 feet tall and hover 80 feet above. Grasping the tools of their trades\u2014among them a quill pen, a painter\u2019s palette, a lyre, even a chemist\u2019s flask and a fossil \u2014these female spirits are said to provide encouragement for earthly pursuits. They were added during the first expansion of the grand building, completed in 1907. Small snail fossils found in a Grand Staircase wall. \u201cHidden\u201d Fossils\n\nVisitors who explore the shared Carnegie Museums and Library building in Oakland often marvel at the architecture and its head-turning multicolored marbles and limestones. What they might overlook, however, are the fossils buried in those beautiful stones. Look closely at the columns and pillars of the Grand Staircase and the walls in the Music Hall foyer and you\u2019ll find a variety of seashell species preserved in the \u00c9chaillon limestone, mined from cliffs in the valley of the Is\u00e8re River of the western Alps in southeastern France. Look closely at the beige Hauteville stone, also from France, that covers the Grand Staircase walls and the floors of the Halls of Sculpture and Architecture to discover 5-inch-long Nerinea snails. It took Albert Kollar, geologist and collection manager for invertebrate paleontology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and his French colleagues years of fieldwork to authenticate the provenance of the stones. Soot-Covered Eastern Towhees\n\nLong before people monitored air quality through electronic devices, the soot on birds\u2019 bellies recorded the history of air pollution. From 1880 to 2015, the soot stains on the plumage of birds preserved in museum collections in Chicago, Detroit, and Pittsburgh clearly decline in line with legislative and social changes of the 20th century, such as the switch from coal to natural gas in residential heating. Black carbon, in addition to being a public health hazard, is a major contributor to anthropogenic climate change. Thanks to the research of a pair of University of Chicago graduate students who measured the black carbon on some 1,300 birds from the collections of the Field Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, and Carnegie Museum of Natural History, a clear picture of emissions in the past emerged, which will help to improve the accuracy of future climate scenarios. Carl Fuldner and Shane DuBay published their findings in 2017 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Because birds molt their feathers annually, the soot on the bird at the time of its death\u2014including on these eastern towhees once on view in Carnegie Museum of Natural History\u2019s Anthropocene Living Room\u2014is a snapshot of that year in industrial history. Zeiss Star Projector\n\nThe Zeiss Model II Star Projector sure could make an entrance. For more than 50 years, every show at the original Buhl Planetarium would begin with the alien-looking contraption dramatically rising from the floor. And then, as if by magic, it would illuminate the domed ceiling with the sight of more than 9,000 stars. It was the ingenuity of Carl Zeiss and the optical manufacturing company that bears his name that made it all possible. Complex clockwork mechanisms allowed the projector to accurately display the stars as they would appear at any point in time, from any place on Earth. But with the opening of Carnegie Science Center in 1991 and the ever-growing use of digital technology, its magic began to fade. Although long retired from duty, the Zeiss still looms large on the first floor of the Science Center where it stands as the focal point of a permanent interactive exhibit. The Crowning Of Labor\n\nJohn White Alexander had his marching orders: Paint an homage to the hardworking people and industrial achievements of Pittsburgh. He delivered a three-story, 4,000-square-foot mural that still surrounds Carnegie Museums\u2019 Grand Staircase. When Andrew Carnegie welcomed crowds to his newly expanded Pittsburgh museums in 1907, the spectacle of Alexander\u2019s The Crowning of Labor greeted them at the building\u2019s majestic new entrance. The drama of Alexander\u2019s mural starts on the first floor, with muscled male laborers toiling away in the steam and smoke of their industrial workplace. On the second floor, three panels tout the glory of labor, symbolized by an ascending male figure clad in a suit of armor (Carnegie, maybe?). On the third floor, Pittsburgh citizens march toward an enlightened, sunlit future, but the panels representing the fruits of their labor\u2014art, music, literature, and science\u2014remain blank; Alexander died before completing them. It\u2019s hard to believe the entire mural was painted in New York City, shipped to Pittsburgh, and then glued onto the walls. In 1995, Museum of Art conservators cleaned and restored the mural in honor of Carnegie Museums\u2019 centennial.

While those who were lost were still on their minds, the members of the military were able to relax as well and enjoy a night that was focused solely on them. Three football stations, including passing, receiving and field goal kicking, were set up around the field, a perfect opportunity for the military members to test their skill level with those who do it for a living. Among the players taking part were Keeanu Benton, Jalen Elliott, Thomas Graham Jr., Christian Kuntz and Isaiahh Loudermilk. In addition to the drills, the players posted for pictures with the military members as they shared stories of watching football while on deployment. \"It's important because they give of their time to do well by us,\" said Benton. \"I feel like by any means, if I can do the same, I will do it. being out here giving back. \"It's about the interaction for me.

Ogunjobi provided backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh. \"I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year,\" said Ogunjobi. \"Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students.\"\n\nOgunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their S.T.E.M. program, something that hits home for him as he earned his degree in computer science and biology from North Carolina Charlotte. \"The Urban Academy community thanks Larry and the Pittsburgh Steelers for their ongoing commitment to our students and community,\" said Chase Patterson, CEO of Urban Academy. \"For the third consecutive year, Larry's generosity is making a difference in supporting our student's success.

Growing up, football was important to me, but my parents also preached education,\" said Elliott. \"I am not just doing back to school supplies, but clothes and shoes too. It's hard for parents, especially single parent homes, and I have two sisters who are single mothers, and it can be hard to try and provide everything you need for school. That takes a burden off the kids and the moms. The kids can then just focus on their education. \"And this is an opportunity for me to give back to my hometown, which is now here.\"\n\nElliott took a group of kids shopping for their back-to-school needs as well as shoes and clothes, making sure they are set for the new school year. He also spent time interacting with the kids, being present, which is sometimes one of the most important aspects. \"It means a lot,\" said Elliott. \"I am giving back, but being there, showing up, that means a lot to kids. Being able to talk to them, and them learning from me, who I am, answering questions."

Myron Cope , the longtime color analyst and inventor of the \" Terrible Towel \", retired after the 2004 season , and died in 2008. Longtime lead announcer Bill Hillgrove retired after the 2023 season . Pre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV , channel 2; independent sister station WPKD-TV , channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh . KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program Steelers Kickoff during the regular season prior to the national airing of The NFL Today . Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the Xfinity Xtra Point following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh.

The Steelers hold a national contract with Grupo Imagen for radio rights to their games in Mexico; Imagen broadcasts the Steelers on their stations in 17 Mexican cities. Figures with broadcasting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s Main article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers figures in broadcasting The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope , who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons ( 1970 \u2013 2004 ). [ 220 ] Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. Newspaper The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. [ 221 ] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. Usage in popular culture The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films: The January 11, 1975, episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device. [ 222 ] Black Sunday in 1977 [ 223 ] Heaven Can Wait in 1978 [ 224 ] Smokey and the Bandit II in 1980 [ 225 ] Fighting Back in 1980 [ 226 ] Hey Kid, Catch! in 1980 [ 227 ] ...All the Marbles in 1981 Evening Shade (TV series) 1990\u20131994 [ 228 ] The Waterboy cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998 [ 229 ] The Longest Yard in 2005 The Chief a theater production. Black and Yellow in 2010. [ 230 ] The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Mad Men's April 14, 2013, episode has Don Draper , Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling meeting with two HJ Heinz executives. The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20\u201328). Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE . [ 233 ] The protagonist of John Grisham 's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan. [ 234 ] In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country , featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain . [ 235 ] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'. The Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research The Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1\u00a0million. [ 236 ] The Foundation, started by Steelers president Art Rooney II, focuses on education and research regarding brain injuries and sports-related concussions. [ 237 ] In June 2017, the Steelers announced an inaugural charity walk to raise money for the foundation.

        "Question": "Where was the first baseball World Series hosted?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Exposition Park",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation. [ 30 ] Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field. [ 31 ] When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth 's career on May 25, 1935 [ 35 ] and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series . The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh \"Pitt\" Panthers . Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE , although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium . In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit. [ 38 ] LECOM Park , which hosts the Pirates' Spring Training games Spring Training [ edit ] Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida , which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders . Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach , which dates to 1914. [ 39 ] It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park , built in 1912, and Wrigley Field , built in 1914. [ 40 ] Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights. [ 41 ] The park was formerly named \"McKechnie Field,\" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie , who led the Pirates in 1925 ; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine , which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania , and also a campus in Bradenton. [ 42 ] Pirate City , the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park. Logos and uniforms [ edit ] 1888: \"Alleghenys\" Logo 1900\u20131906 1907 1908\u20131909 1915\u20131919 1921, 1932 1922 1923\u20131931 1933\u20131935 1948\u2013present Uniform design in the 1940s The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century. [ 43 ] During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket. [ 43 ] The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942. [ 43 ] In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League . The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924, [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] but the change did not last beyond that season. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Along with the San Francisco Giants , the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009. In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds ), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit). [ 43 ] The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch. Willie Stargell wearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes . After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. [ 43 ] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys , following the Oakland Athletics . Starting in 1977 , the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The",
            "first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season . Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960 . They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees , yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente , the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971 . Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass . In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. [ 16 ] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970 , 1971 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 , and 1979 . Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell , Dave Parker , and Al Oliver , the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990. The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , and Doug Drabek . The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992 . Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. Andrew McCutchen , 2012 With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park , did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen , defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game . They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals . That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. [ 17 ] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th [ 18 ] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies , Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs . [ 19 ] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Ballpark [ edit ] Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium , a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. [ 20 ] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services . [ 21 ] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game , when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130. PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; [ 26 ] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, [ 27 ] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente , who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell , Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge , or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station , located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. Former ballparks [ edit ] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park , located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park , which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete"

            "Stargell wearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes . After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. [ 43 ] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys , following the Oakland Athletics . Starting in 1977 , the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series . The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since. [ 43 ] After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009 , the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road. [ 43 ] From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019. [ 49 ] Since the 2015 season , the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games. [ 50 ] The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season , now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches. [ 51 ] Ahead of the 2020 season , the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow. [ 52 ] In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park. In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted \"Y\", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh ( Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio ). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous \"Steelmark\" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh. [ 53 ] Rivalries [ edit ] Philadelphia Phillies [ edit ] Main article: Phillies\u2013Pirates rivalry The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies. [ 57 ] The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969\u20131993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s. [ 56 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span. [ 58 ] After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry. [ 60 ] Cincinnati Reds [ edit ] Main article: Pirates-Reds rivalry The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds , given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry , and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason, [ 61 ] most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game . In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches , occasionally resulting in brawls. [ 62 ] Divisional foes [ edit ] From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series , which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious [ 63 ] battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game . The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of the 1938 season . Interleague [ edit ] The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers . While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League 's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins . The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986\u20131996) and the Tigers (2005\u20132013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36\u201329. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series . An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically. The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule. The Pirates lead the series 21\u201318.

            "Making their day: The Steelers hosted a group from UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh at practice on Saturday as part of the team's community relations program. Thursday, August 1\n\nWelcoming another group: The Steelers hosted a group from the Latino Community Center at practice on Thursday as part of the team's community relations program.

Wednesday, July 31\n\nWelcoming back some friends: The Steelers hosted a group from the Urban Impact Foundation at practice on Wednesday as part of the team's community relations program. Urban Impact and the Steelers have a long history of improving the lives of kids on Pittsburgh's North Side. Tuesday, July 30\n\nA Batch of fun at practice: The Steelers hosted a group from the Best of the Batch Foundation at practice on Tuesday as part of the team's community relations program. Best of the Batch Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1999 by former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch and his wife Latasha. Best of the Batch Foundation provides year-round educational programming to more than 3,800 children ranging in ages from 4 to 18, across 22 school districts in eight western Pennsylvania counties. Sunday, July 28\n\nWelcoming more groups: The Steelers hosted two groups at practice on Sunday as part of the team's community relations program. The Foster Love Project was on hand along with Special Olympics Pennsylvania, a perfect time with the Olympics now in full swing. Today, @FosterLovePgh & @SOPennsylvania joined us for our last practice of #SteelersCamp this week! pic.twitter.com/eVK7gTXlyA\n\nSaturday, July 27\n\nA wish comes true: Saturday was a dream come true for 18-year-old Cole Walker, who was a guest of the Steelers at training camp through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Walker, who is a huge Steelers fan, met several Steelers players after practice, including George Pickens who helped in the presentation of granting his wish for Steelers season tickets through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. \"This was such an honor,\" said Walker. \"I am truly grateful to the Steelers and Make-A-Wish for this opportunity. It's awesome. \"I am so excited. I have always loved the Steelers, always loved going to games and supporting the team. This is an amazing opportunity. I am so happy and excited.\"\n\nWalker, who is from Pittsburgh, is dealing with sarcoma and his wish was all about enjoying his favorite team all year. And at camp, all his wishes came true. \"It was just so exciting,\" said Walker. \"And I met T.J. Watt.\"\n\nGeorge Pickens helped grant Cole's wish of #Steelers season tickets through @MakeAWishPAWV today! pic.twitter.com/3xoXEBBuPX\n\nHappy to have them here: The Steelers hosted a group from the Monessen Positive Action Community Team (MPACT) at practice on Saturday as part of the team's community relations program. The motto for MPACT is 'you feel good about yourself when you do positive actions, and there is a positive way to do everything.'\n\nThe program is part of the the Monessen School District, started in 2020 as an after-school program that aims to improve academic performance and student behavior. The team also hosted a group from Voices Without Violence. Voices Against Violence (VAV) grew out of a street outreach initiative by Richard Carrington, Sr. working with Pittsburgh gang members in 1992. The organization was formally established in 1995 in response to a growing need for holistic community-based programs that serve youth involved with gangs, drugs, and guns in South Pittsburgh. Voices Against Violence became one of the first and foremost anti-violence organizations in Pittsburgh, pioneering programs in Street Mediation, Conflict Resolution, and Restorative Justice Practices. Voices Against Violence is a successful, non-profit organization using The Pittsburgh Contingency, a registered 501c3, as its official, audited, fiscal conduit.

Young Black Motivated Kings & Queens (YBMKQ) is a community-based organization in Pittsburgh made up of some of the most dedicated young men and women in the city who have chosen to stand apart and show the community that young black kings and queens are active, motivated, and empowered to be the change. The mission is to counteract this narrative by embracing the agency and inviting others to do the same, no matter their circumstance or background. The organization engages elementary, middle and high-school-aged youth in becoming the leaders of tomorrow while serving the community. In addition to providing enriching opportunities for youth, and a safe space for them to come into, we also plan events for community members to come out to build strong connections with the youth, and network. Thursday, July 25\n\nChanging kid's lives: The Steelers hosted a group from the Homewood Children's Village at practice on Thursday as part of the team's community relations program. The group was able to watch practice and meet with some of the players afterwards, getting pictures and autographs. The Homewood Children's Village is making a difference in the lives of kids in the Homewood area, reaching out to them, offering services for them to continue to grow, and taking every step to make sure they don't become a statistic. Because as we all know, it takes a village to raise a child. 2024 Offseason\n\nMonday, July 15\n\nBatter up: Cameron Heyward hosted his annual Three Rivers Celebrity Softball Game at the Washington Wild Things Park on Saturday. The game featured Heyward, some of his teammates, and other area and national celebrities and benefited his foundation, The Heyward House.

Friday, June 28\n\nHighsmith lends a hand: Linebacker Alex Highsmith, and his wife Alyssa, lent their hands on Friday to help those who were impacted by the recent fire at Second Avenue Commons in Pittsburgh. Those staying at the homeless shelter have been displaced since the fire, and Highsmith wanted to do something to assist them. Highsmith hosted a distribution of necessities, from t-shirts and sweatpants to slippers and bookbags, for the individuals to help them through the tough time. Highsmith also provided dinner for the participants at Pittsburgh Mercy, trying to do something to uplift their spirits. Thursday, June 20\n\nEngaging with area youth: The rookies visited the Mel Blount Youth Home in Claysville, Pa., on Thursday, working with the Hall of Fame cornerback to help engage with youth from the surrounding area as a part of his Youth Leadership Initiative. \"With the Youth Leadership Initiative, we're able to work with more kids and have a broader reach,\" said Blount. \"One of the things that we've done is connected with other youth organizations around Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington County, Greene County, Westmoreland County. So, we have a broader reach now. We're able to work and be more effective, reaching more kids. It gives kids, even kids who are not in the system, an opportunity to experience what our program has to offer and help them grow and develop.\"",

            "City Council\u2019s nine representatives are elected to\n\noffice by residents in each of their respective districts. The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or\n\nfraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with\n\nreporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City\u2019s fiscal condition. Every\n\nyear, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information\n\non Pittsburgh\u2019s short-term and long-term financial outlook. City Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also\n\napproves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital\n\nBudgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of\n\nCity government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole. City Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The\n\nCity Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information\n\nresource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget\n\nDivision monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations. It prepares and distributes\n\nto Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City\n\nof Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special\n\nreports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations. The Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly\n\nresponsible for much of the City\u2019s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices,\n\nBureaus, and Commissions.",

The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division . Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants , nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente , the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame , and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell . Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012 , a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues. [ 5 ] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League, [ 6 ] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839\u201310,819\u2013140 (.500 winning 'percentage'). [ 7 ] The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park , a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins . History [ edit ] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club , an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City , across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. [ 8 ] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, [ 9 ] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association . Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, [ 10 ] the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. [ 11 ] Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League 's Pittsburgh Burghers . The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer , who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics . Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\". [ 12 ] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. [ 13 ] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. The 1909 Pirates in a poster celebrating their National League pennant. Frank Chance of Chicago and John McGraw of  New York, two teams the Pirates beat for the pennant, are being made to walk the plank . After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels , who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.) [ 14 ] Among those players was Honus Wagner , who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played , which they lost to Boston . The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909 , defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming",
            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first"

            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century",
            "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]\n\nGeography of industrialization\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]\n\nA further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]\n\nBy about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]\n\nMachine politics\n\nChristopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]\n\nGermans\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]\n\nLabor unions"

By B. Denise Hawkins\n\n|\n\nText Size:\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Carnegie Museum of Art acquired a vast record of African American life in Pittsburgh during the 20th century. It\u2019s a treasure trove of 70,000 print images, photo negatives, and videos from the iconic Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris, longtime photographer for The Pittsburgh Courier , one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Black newspapers, spanning the late \u201930s into the 1970s. As the museum worked to preserve and digitize the photos and identify the people portrayed in them, it organized temporary exhibitions of the collection in which viewers were treated to several dozen images at a time\u2014of dance halls and baseball games, intimate family moments and Civil Rights protests. Often, in a single frame and unfiltered, Harris presented the seldom-seen complexity and joy of African American life and identity. Each exhibition provided snippets of what is considered one of the country\u2019s most detailed and comprehensive photographic records of the Black urban experience. But there has never been a space that showcased all the facets of the archive at once, as Harris had always hoped. \u201cHarris wanted you to see it all, but he also wanted you to listen to the stories he was presenting in his art,\u201d says Charlene Foggie-Barnett, Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris community archivist. With every image, she adds, \u201cHe is leaving clues. He is revealing story lines and truths. He\u2019s making a statement.\u201d\n\nLater this year, museumgoers for the first time will be able to explore this vast archive with a reinstallation of Harris\u2019 work in the Scaife Galleries. The new Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris Archive Gallery will feature never-before-seen components of the archive, including reels of film in canisters, and prints, some in color. Visitors will even be able to view Harris\u2019 photographic negatives, which make up the bulk of the collection. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a more comprehensive, intentional, and creative approach to sharing and honoring the Teenie Harris Archive and how the photographer\u2019s art has illuminated the city\u2019s history,\u201d says Dana Bishop-Root, the museum\u2019s director of education and public programs, who worked with Foggie-Barnett and Curator of Photography Dan Leers, as well as a team of creatives, on the project. Throughout their work, which is ongoing, they considered how the museum invites, welcomes, and engages with the community\u2014including those who knew Harris, his subjects and their families, schoolchildren, teachers, scholars, and other visitors from near and far. \u201cThinking about the ways that people can experience the archive has been at the forefront of our approach to sharing it,\u201d says Bishop-Root. \u201cWe\u2019ve long said that people need the museum, but the museum needs people to keep it alive, inclusive, vibrant, and contemporary.\u201d\n\nViewing \u2018Teenie\u2019 as Never Before\n\nWhen the exhibition opens, Harris\u2019 films, works in color, self-portraits, negatives, and more will be available for visitors to work with, listen to, read about, see\u2014and yes, touch\u2014Leers says. For the first time, visitors will view Harris\u2019 videos and still images side by side, projected on a wall using a multichannel projector. Visitors can also interact with Harris\u2019 negatives, the thin strips of transparent plastic film that gave the photographer his first look at the subjects, using a light table stationed in the gallery. This opportunity to touch and explore the negatives is possible only because of the decades of intensive work that has gone into preserving the archive. Many of Harris\u2019 negatives were stored in his basement studio before the museum received them. \u201cThere were a group of negatives that were seriously curled up on each other and without protective sleeves,\u201d adds Leers. The work of restoring and digitizing them, which is nearly complete, has been intensive and daily over the past two decades. Pittsburghers first saw Harris\u2019 photos in black and white in the pages of The Pittsburgh Courier , the city\u2019s influential Black newspaper. For the first time, the museum will print some of those images on newsprint, giving visitors a look and feel for how Harris\u2019 photographs appeared when they rolled off the press. Experiencing the Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris Archive Gallery will also include seeing the photographer as never before. Harris was a month shy of his 90th birthday when he died on June 12, 1998. But in exhibitions of his work, the artist is typically portrayed as a much younger man in his 30s\u2014bright-eyed, with finger waves in his black hair, and sporting his signature suit and tie. For the first time, the museum will present self-portraits, some in color, of Harris as an older man. \u201cDeciding to present portraits of the older Harris offered an opportunity for us to broaden the personal image of Harris, and who he was as a community member, family man, and artist,\u201d says Leers. Those new portraits of the photographer will be interspersed in a mosaic display that features Harris\u2019 life and career, layered with the major moments in Black history, American history, and international history he chronicled. The museum also wants to broaden and focus on the visitors who will be engaging with the work Harris created. \u201cDeciding to present portraits of the older Harris offered an opportunity for us to broaden the personal image of Harris, and who he was as a community member, family man, and artist.\u201d",
            "\u201cThere are photos from the unveiling where there are people shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d says Lamanna. Back in Pittsburgh, big things were in the works. \u201cMultiple sources cite the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and Carnegie\u2019s desire to display its mounted skeleton as a major driving force behind the construction of an expanded Carnegie Institute building,\u201d says Lamanna. In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall. Diplodocus carnegii finally had a forever home. \u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d says Tom Rea, author of Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Dinosaur . The display of real fossils\u2014not just casts\u2014is what made it momentous, explains Rea. Before long, word of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus spread like wildfire. And everybody wanted a piece. Dippy\u2019s World Tour\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the largest and most respected museums in the world were only just beginning to catch dino-fever. \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing time in science when you think about it,\u201d says Rea. \u201cThese were all temples of science,\u201d adds Rea, who is also editor and founder of WyoHistory.org, a project of the Wyoming Historical Society. \u201cThese big halls, with high ceilings and dramatic arches, and daylight coming down through the clerestory, and all that stuff that makes these spaces so fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nBut most of them had nothing like a Diplodocus . So when requests started to pour in from abroad, Carnegie again seized the moment. Before long, casts would be sent to some of the largest cities in the world. According to Rea, Berlin erected its Diplodocus cast in March 1908. Paris followed suit that June. The following year, Vienna and Bologna joined the trend, and then St. Petersburg in 1910, La Plata, Argentina, in 1912, Madrid in 1913, and Mexico City in 1930. For the vast majority of museumgoers of the day, it would be the first dinosaur they\u2019d ever laid eyes upon. \u201cThe cool thing about that is, most of these casts are still on display,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cWhen you think about all the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people that see Diplodocus carnegii casts every year in all these European cities, in Latin [and South] America, and couple that with the fact that these mounts have been on display in many cases for more than a century,\u201d says Lamanna, \u201cthis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nThe House That Dippy Built\n\nNo one is quite sure who first coined \u201cDippy\u201d as the nickname for Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus . \u201cI can tell you that the fossil preparator Arthur Coggeshall used the nickname in three articles he wrote in Carnegie magazine about the discovery and fame of D. carnegii in September, October, and November 1951,\u201d says Rea. Coggeshall had been connected to the museum for more than half a century at that point. In fact, he was on the original expedition in Wyoming when Dippy was discovered. Nieuwland adds that Coggeshall\u2019s boss, Holland, referred to the Diplodocus as \u201cOld Dip,\u201d but not Dippy. The one thing we do know is that pretty much as soon as the casts of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus started stomping around the world, some scientists took issue with how the mount stood. This was due, in part, to a notion of the day that dinosaurs would have stood like modern-day lizards and crocodiles\u2014low to the ground, with tail in tow and legs sprawled widely apart. But Holland, who started his career as a butterfly expert before doubling as the museum\u2019s paleontologist, contended in 1910 that the legs of Diplodocus held the animal higher off the ground, more like a mammal. \u201cUltimately, Holland\u2019s argument was proven correct,\u201d says Lamanna, who cites the subsequent discovery of fossilized sauropod trackways showing that the feet were placed close together as the deciding factor. \u201cAnd now everyone that knows or cares at all about sauropods reconstructs them with their legs underneath their bodies, like an elephant.\u201d\n\nMore changes came over time\u2014and some of them quite recently. Lamanna arrived at the museum in 2004 and at the time, the tail of Diplodocus carnegii still lay upon the ground. Worse still, it nearly touched the feet of a T. rex , a dinosaur that humans are closer to in time than Diplodocus would have been. \u201cSo this was wrong on two levels,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cFirst of all, the dinosaur\u2019s tail probably didn\u2019t touch the ground very much, if at all. And secondly, having the tail lap against the ankles of a 66-million-year-old dinosaur \u2026 I mean, you might as well have had a caveman riding the T. rex .\u201d\n\nGetting Dippy\u2019s tail off the ground\u2014and away from T. rex \u2014was just one of many changes that went into the creation of the museum\u2019s Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition, which opened in 2008 in a space triple the size of the original Dinosaur Hall. Among other changes, Lamanna and his colleagues also switched the bones in Dippy\u2019s forelimbs and added vertebrae in its tail, in keeping with the latest research. Elsewhere in the exhibition, scientists, artists, and fossil preparators transformed formerly two-dimensional fossils into three-dimensional works of art, including Dryosaurus elderae, Camptosaurus aphanoecetes , and Corythosaurus casuarius . Similarly, real fossil heads of Edmontosaurus regalis and Triceratops prorsus received cast bodies, bringing them to life. And it\u2019s not just the mounts, says Lamanna. The team has also worked to surround the dinos with plants, rocks, smaller animals, and other facets of the ecosystems they would have once inhabited to create a more immersive visitor experience. Of the roughly 230 objects now on display in Dinosaurs in Their Time , about 75 percent are real fossils, not casts, making this one of the most impressive paleontological exhibitions on Earth. Dippy: Teacher And Celebrity\n\nOf course, in paleontology, there will always be questions we can\u2019t answer. For instance, scientists have yet to find a Diplodocus carnegii head, meaning the one sported by Dippy currently is a cast of a skull of the related species Diplodocus longus . And remember, Dippy is already a composite skeleton\u2014meaning it\u2019s made up of multiple specimens. Lamanna\u2014who has helped discover and name much larger sauropods known as titanosaurs\u2014says that Dippy was the bedrock on which so much future paleontology would be built. \u201c Diplodocus is one of our first windows into sauropod biology,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe appearance, behavior, lifestyle, evolutionary relationships; when we do research on sauropods today, in a lot of ways we\u2019re standing on the shoulders of the people that did research on Diplodocus back in the day, and also Diplodocus itself.\u201d\n\nThe museum has also fully embraced Dippy\u2019s celebrity\u2014placing the dino in its logo and stationing a full-bodied gelcoat and fiberglass replica outside on Forbes Avenue. These days, the outdoor Dippy may be the one that gets the most attention, on account of its ever-changing accessories."

            "W. Mellon Acquisition Endowment Fund and Carnegie International Acquisition Fund \u00a9 Dan Graham. By permission</sp\n\nHeart Pavilion by Dan Graham\n\nThe heart-shaped aluminum and glass structure created by Dan Graham for the 1991 Carnegie International is a visitor favorite in Carnegie Museum of Art\u2019s Scaife Galleries. At first glance, the nearly 8-foot-tall and 14-foot-wide installation projects the architectural gravitas and cool detachment of an urban skyscraper. But as viewers inch closer, its surface\u2014both transparent and reflective\u2014provides a much more intimate experience. As visitors wander in and around the Heart Pavilion , they see their own reflections and watch as total strangers enter the space, becoming an integral part of the installation. \u201cMy pavilions derive their meaning from the people who look at themselves and others, and who are being looked at themselves,\u201d said Graham, a seminal figure in contemporary art. \u201cWithout people in them, they might look a bit like minimal-art sculptures, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re meant to be.\u201d\n\nTools for tracking birds\n\nPowdermill Avian Research Center has always sought to provide a bird\u2019s eye view of the world. Established 60 years ago as part of Powdermill Nature Reserve, Carnegie Museum of Natural History\u2019s environmental research center, it reached a remarkable milestone in the summer of 2021 when it banded its 800,000th bird. Each tiny aluminum bracelet bearing a nine-digit identification number and slipped onto a bird\u2019s leg gives avian researchers a crucial snapshot of bird populations and their migration patterns. And while banding is invaluable for long-term studies, it only tells us something when a bird is caught by another researcher or found dead by someone who knows to submit the data online. We don\u2019t know where they go on their journey, and why. By using the emerging technology known as Motus Wildlife Tracking, Powdermill researchers are now also receiving real-time data by attaching tiny, lightweight transmitters to birds. Paired with a large-scale network of receiving stations, radios can pick up the signal from a transmitter up to 9 miles away. Because each transmitter produces a unique ping, a bird wearing one is under surveillance everywhere it goes, sometimes for life. John Kane, Bloomfield Bridge , c."

            "Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation\u2019s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre. By Chick-fil-A\n\nMuch of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966). Central to the city\u2019s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall.",
            "Today, each of these dynamic regional attractions are operated by dedicated non-profit entities on the City's behalf. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium opened in 1898 after philanthropist Christopher Lyman Magee donated $125,000 for the construction of a zoological garden in Pittsburgh's Highland Park. Today, the Pittsburgh Zoo is one transformed, dedicating its resources to conservation, education, & research. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens was a gift to the City of Pittsburgh from philanthropist Henry W. Phipps. The Conservatory opened to the public in 1893 and today is dedicated to mission of educating the public on the beauty and importance of plants while advancing sustainability. The National Aviary is America's only independent bird sanctuary. Built by the City of Pittsburgh in 1952 as the \"Pittsburgh Aviary\" the aviary received the honorary declaration of national status by the United States Congress in 1992. On November 25, 1881 Andrew Carnegie sent a letter to Mayor Robert W. Lyon offering to donate $250,000 for a free library, provided the City would agree to provide the land and maintain the annual funding for library operations. Today, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh 's 19 branches host more than 2.9 million visitors each year, why it is viewed as the catalyst to an improving quality of life in the region. The Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh 's four museums cover a wide range of cultural options. Children will gain education by exploring and entertaining themselves through programs in technology, sports, and science at the Carnegie Science Center & SportsWorks . The Carnegie Museum of Natural History and Carnegie Museum of Art bring the world's most historic natural and artistic moments to life, with a renowned dinosaur collection. The Andy Warhol Museum is the largest museum in America dedicated to a single artist. There, visitors can become immersed in the work of this world famous Pittsburgh born and raised icon. The Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center is the Smithsonian's home in Pittsburgh and one of the largest history museums in Pennsylvania chronicling the remarkable history of Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania region. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust maintains high quality Broadway entertainment year round. Some of the most talented performers in America have graced the stages of the Benedum Center, Byham Theater, or Harris Theater. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra calls Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts home. It is one of the nation's renowned orchestras, and a Pittsburgh tradition since 1895.

            "before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13\u20133 mark. [ 66 ] Their postseason was short lived with a 45\u201342 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. [ 67 ] Despite a 9\u20136\u20131 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs. [ 68 ] The Steelers went 8\u20138 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season. [ 69 ] The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11\u20130 start. [ 70 ] However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12\u20134. [ 71 ] The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48\u201337. [ 72 ] The 2021 season saw the team go 9\u20137\u20131 and make the postseason. [ 73 ] The Steelers lost 42\u201321 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. [ 74 ] Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season. [ 75 ] Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162\u201394\u20132 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013\u201317 seasons were noted for record performances from the \" Killer B's \". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown , Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell . [ 76 ] Occasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals. [ 77 ] Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. [ 78 ] Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9\u20138 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season. [ 79 ] In the 2023 season, the team finished 10\u20137 and third in the AFC North. [ 80 ] They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31\u201317. [ 81 ] Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. [ 82 ] The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Summary Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444\u2013282\u20132 (.635) and an overall record of 480\u2013305\u20132 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. [ 85 ] Ownership Art Rooney II , controlling owner of the Steelers Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations. [ 86 ] Dan Rooney , and his son, Art Rooney II , president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers\u00a0\u2013 Timothy and Patrick\u00a0\u2013 wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York. [ 87 ] Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines , causing them to violate \"NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests\". [ 88 ] Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time: Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr. , John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys. The Robert A. Paul family of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, which is primarily involved with Pittsburgh-based Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation as well as Morton's Restaurant Group, Urban Active Fitness, Meyer Products and Harley Marine Services. Additionally, family members serve on numerous boards , including Cornell University, UPMC , University of Pittsburgh , the American Red Cross , Harvard Medical School and the Loomis Chaffee School.

[ 90 ] President Obama poses with the Steelers in 2009. Left to right: Ben Roethlisberger , Hines Ward , Obama, and Dan Rooney . The Peter Varischetti family of Brockway , which owns several nursing homes and a commercial real estate business. [ 90 ] Paul Evanson, chairman, president, and CEO of Allegheny Energy . [ 91 ] Russ and Scott Swank of Lower Burrell . [ 92 ] Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams: [ 93 ] Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam purchased the Cleveland Browns in 2012. Hedge fund manager David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018. Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils owner Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders in 2023. Investment partner David Blitzer was also a part of the Harris group. Season-by-season records Further information: List of Pittsburgh Steelers seasons Through the end of the 2023 season , the Steelers have an all-time record of 707\u2013606\u201322, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times. [ 94 ] In the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). [ 95 ] The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The Steelers are 36\u201326 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger. [ 98 ] Civil rights advocacy The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry ), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam ), [ a ] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris ), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy ), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer ( Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).

        "Question": "What rivers converge to form the Ohio River at Pittsburgh?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Allegheny and Monongahela rivers",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Ohio River, major river artery of the east-central United States. Formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at Pittsburgh, it flows northwest out of Pennsylvania, then in a general southwesterly direction to join the Mississippi River at Cairo, Illinois (see photograph), after a course of 981 miles (1,579 km). It marks several state boundaries: the Ohio\u2013West Virginia, Ohio\u2013Kentucky, Indiana\u2013Kentucky, and Illinois\u2013Kentucky. The Ohio River contributes more water to the Mississippi than does any other tributary and drains an area of 203,900 square miles (528,100 square km). The river\u2019s valley is narrow, with an average width of less than 0.5 mile (0.8 km) between Pittsburgh and Wheeling (West Virginia), a little more than 1 mile (1.6 km) from Cincinnati (Ohio) to Louisville (Kentucky) and somewhat greater below Louisville. The Ohio is navigable, and, despite seasonal fluctuations that occasionally reach flood proportions, its fairly uniform flow has supported important commerce since settlement first began. Following destructive floods at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1889 and Portsmouth, Ohio, in 1937, the federal government built a series of flood-control dams. While not developed for hydropower in Ohio, the river, kept at a navigable depth of 9 feet (3 metres), carries cargoes of coal, oil, steel, and manufactured articles. It has a total fall of only 429 feet (130 metres), the one major hazard to navigation being the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, where locks control a descent of about 24 feet (7 metres) within a distance of 2.5 miles (4 km). The Ohio\u2019s tributaries include the Tennessee, Cumberland, Kanawha, Big Sandy, Licking, Kentucky, and Green rivers from the south and the Muskingum, Miami, Wabash, and Scioto rivers from the north. Chief cities along the river, in addition to Pittsburgh, Cairo, Wheeling, and Louisville, are Steubenville, Marietta, Gallipolis, Portsmouth, and Cincinnati in Ohio; Madison, New Albany, Evansville, and Mount Vernon in Indiana; Parkersburg and Huntington in West Virginia; and Ashland, Covington, Owensboro, and Paducah in Kentucky. Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, is said to have been the first European to see the Ohio, in 1669, and he descended it until obstructed by a waterfall (presumably the Falls at Louisville). In the 1750s the river\u2019s strategic importance (especially the fork at Pittsburgh) in the struggle between the French and the English for possession of the interior of the continent became fully recognized. By the treaty of 1763 ending the French and Indian Wars, the English finally gained undisputed control of the territory along its banks. When (by an ordinance of 1787) the area was opened to settlement, most of the settlers entered the region down the headwaters of the Ohio. sports, physical contests pursued for the goals and challenges they entail.",

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933\u2013present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season . [ 21 ] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969 , Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970 , Jack Ham in 1971 , Franco Harris in 1972 , [ 22 ] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann , Jack Lambert , John Stallworth , Donnie Shell and Mike Webster .

        "Question": "Who manages the operating and special revenue budget for Pittsburgh?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "City Controller",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to\n\ndebt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law\n\nacts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella\n\norganizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire,\n\nEmergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and\n\nSafety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations,\n\nEnvironmental Services, and Facilities. Additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City\u2019s managerial\n\nhierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City\u2019s General Fund. For this reason, these\n\nAuthorities are not included in the Operating Budget. A comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart\n\npresented in this document. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\n\nFiscal Year 2024\n\nBudget Guide\n\n19\n\nWhat is the Operating Budget? The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are\n\nfigures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are\n\nspread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the\n\nadministration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public\n\nsafety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and\n\nprogramming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the\n\nroutine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers\u2019\n\ncompensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service. The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are\n\ncollected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,\n\ncharges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other\n\nrevenue generating mechanisms. The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what\n\ngovernmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal\n\nyear. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in\n\ndelivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed. The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and\n\nMembers of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the\n\nCity of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of\n\nPittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire\n\nthrough tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must\n\nprioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the\n\nCity. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits\n\npriorities set by the City\u2019s elected public officials. Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of\n\nPittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the\n\nCity of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating\n\nBudget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial\n\ncreation of the plan. Basis of Accounting\n\nThe General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh\n\nrecognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid. The Fiscal Year\n\nThe City of Pittsburgh\u2019s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of\n\neach year. This can only be changed by ordinance.",

There were also flag football drills as the Steelers have hopped on board full force with helping to grow the sport. \"I wanted to do this to celebrate our women fans,\" said receiver Calvin Austin III. \"To be able to celebrate, talk with them, and have a day that is special for them means a lot. I went on the Steelers cruise, and nothing doubts me about this fanbase. They know all the details.

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933\u2013present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season .

            "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]\n\nShannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]\n\nEuropeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000\u00a0acres (800\u00a0km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130\u00a0km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt."

            "Cookie List\n\nURL: https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-feb-11-x8655\n\nCONTENT:\n\nAsked and Answered\n\nAsked and Answered: Feb. 11\n\nSteelers.com\n\nLet's get to it:\n\nROBERT YEAGER FROM CANYON COUNTRY, CA: With all the popular options of alternative uniforms in the NFL, have the Steelers ever thought about honoring the gold shoulder pad uniforms? I thought those were very cool/different than other NFL uniforms of the day. ANSWER: I am not privy to the conversations/decisions about selecting a throwback jersey for a particular season, but the uniforms you reference certainly were unique and part of my early memories of the Steelers and the NFL. The following is something I wrote for Steelers.com about the origin of those uniforms and their brief history with the franchise:\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Green Bay Packers were the National Football League's dominant team. They had won championships in 1961, 1962, 1965 and 1966, and they had played for the title in 1960. In that respect, every NFL team wanted to be like the Packers. Dan Rooney might have wanted the Steelers to win like the Packers, but he didn't necessarily want them to look like the Green Bay Packers. In early 1966, the Steelers players had an executive committee that would meet with ownership about issues that concerned them. At that time, one of the issues was the uniform. John Campbell, a linebacker going into his second season with the team, was on the executive committee, and he was the one who asked Dan Rooney to do something about the uniform. Mindful of how many teams were morphing into Packers look-a-likes, Dan Rooney decided to make an attempt at something distinctive. That also was the time when the City of Pittsburgh was trying to remake its image, trying to get away from the perception of a dirty, smoky city. One of the areas being refurbished was Downtown, called the \"Golden Triangle\" because that was the shape of the land created by the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers flowing into the Ohio River. Dan Rooney decided to incorporate this unique bit of the city's geography into the Steelers new uniforms, and that's how the triangle design came to be a part of the jersey. The triangle was always gold, with the rest of the home jersey being black with white numbers and the road jersey being white with black numbers. But if the intent of linking the team to its city was a nice idea, the practical execution of it didn't always go smoothly. For example, washing the uniforms. In 1966, the Steelers preseason finale was against the Cleveland Browns in Birmingham, Ala., and they were to wear the black jerseys with the gold triangles, because the Browns always preferred to wear their white jerseys. But in laundering the Steelers' jerseys, the black bled into the gold triangles and created an aesthetic mess. And then, not everyone was able to make the connection between the Steelers' jerseys and Pittsburgh's geography. Midway through the 1966 season, the Steelers were set to play a game against the Cowboys in Dallas on Oct. 30. Like the Browns, the Cowboys always preferred to wear white jerseys, and so the Steelers were outfitted in their black jerseys with the gold triangles. Shortly before kickoff, Dan Rooney appeared on the Cowboys pregame radio show to promote the matchup and he was asked, \"Are your wearing those uniforms because tomorrow is Halloween?\"\n\nAnd so following the 1967 season, the Steelers \"retired\" their golden triangle jerseys for good, but they still remain an interesting part of the franchise's rich history.

By Chick-fil-A\n\nMuch of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966). Central to the city\u2019s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall.",

            "Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a]\n\nThe steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[52] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[53]\n\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539\u00a0km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. Cityscape\n\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[54] and four main areas surrounding it\u2014Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.[55]\n\nDowntown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150\u00a0m), with the U.S. Steel Tower being the tallest at 841\u00a0ft (256\u00a0m).[56] The Cultural District spans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[57] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown. The North Side, originally the independent Allegheny City until being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions like Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the National Aviary, among others.[58]\n\nThe South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixed-use development. The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers.",

And it's a great opportunity. \"But I think to honor someone who just takes time out of their day to make sure that homeless people have access to socks, food and all the other things that she's been able to do to help streamline a lot of the services for organizations in Pittsburgh that are providing services to our most vulnerable is really important. Especially, she has all of these socks at her home. I think not only being able to work with community organizations to say, how can we streamline this, but how can we distribute 14,000 pairs of socks in our community. Then also to have space in your garage to make sure that you're able to house that. \"It's a great opportunity when we're able to honor people who are CEOs and in charge of different organizations and nonprofits. But it's also really important to make sure that we highlight community members that are taking time out of their day. They don't have to do it. They just do it to give back.

            "But wait. Those square plates are moving, flipping one after another, perfectly in sync. The plates, which are keeping the exact time, are the mechanical pieces of the largest binary flip clock ever created. Doug DeHaven, a mechatronics engineer at the North Shore museum, wanted to make a timepiece that was both visually interesting and functional for a new wall erected as part of the addition of the PPG Science Pavilion. But he didn\u2019t want a clattering clock with noise that would disturb staff. So he dreamed up a mechanical creation consisting of three rows representing seconds, minutes, and hours\u2014and, of course, a splash of artistry. Each column includes graphics that represent different ways humans count\u2014from military time to Roman numerals, American Sign Language, and the programming language Scratch. Mallard Duck Decoys\n\nNorth American hunters have used decoys for centuries. Indigenous Americans fashioned them from reeds, clay, and stuffed skins to lure migrating birds within range of their arrows and spears. European settlers observed the effectiveness of what were often quite rudimentary decoy rigs, such as duck skins wrapped over floating logs arranged to look like a wading bird and adopted the practice. By the early 19th century, both commercial and sport hunters were using carved wooden decoys. However, some hunters preferred real skin decoys known as \u201cstuffers,\u201d like these made by Whistler Brothers. They were popular during the Depression and donated to Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1980 by benefactor Edward O\u2019Neil. Made from farm-raised mallards, the skins were wrapped around cork bodies and heavily varnished so that they float, and lead weights were added to the undersides to allow them to float upright. \u201cI always thought this was a cool form of taxidermy begun by Indigenous people and still used to some extent today,\u201d says Stephen Rogers, collection manager for the section of birds and a taxidermist. Dippy\u2019s Scarves\n\nDiplodocus carnegii , the long-necked star of Carnegie Museum of Natural History\u2019s world-famous collection of Jurassic giants, got its own public sculpture in 1999, celebrating a century since he was unearthed at Sheep Creek, Wyoming. That winter, Janice Heagy, former Carnegie Museums staff member, handmade Dippy a Jurassic-sized red and green scarf to mark the holiday season, kicking off a now-beloved Pittsburgh tradition\u2014dapper Dippy dressed for the occasion: Steelers playoff football, Pitt move-in day, and LGBTQI+ Pride Month, to name a few. Dippy\u2019s accessories have grown in number over the years to the point that he now has his own closet at the museum stuffed with at least 15 oversized scarves, lovingly made by both staff and volunteers. There\u2019s also a top hat and bow tie, a mortarboard, and, most recently, several face masks. And every St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Dippy celebrates the wearing of the green with his longest and most popular adornment measuring 18 feet long! Photo: Joshua Franzos\n\nT. rex Holotype\n\nDespite their relatively puny arms, Tyrannosaurus rex had the jaw-dropping power of a 40-foot-long, 5-ton body. And their spiky teeth were sharp, efficient, and deadly. Roaming what is today the western U.S. and southwestern Canada in search of food, the meat-eating T. rex ruled some 68 to 66 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period. But it wasn\u2019t until 1902 that the holotype\u2014the scientific name-bearing specimen and the one to which all others must be compared\u2014was unearthed at Hell Creek, Montana. At the turn of the century, the competition among museums to discover and display dinosaur fossils was fierce. Young fossil hunter Barnum Brown was hired by New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History to lead its charge, and he did not disappoint. Over three years, he unearthed what was at the time a whole new species of dinosaur. But it didn\u2019t take long before Brown moved on to bigger and better findings. His 1908 excavation of a more complete T. rex skeleton prompted the museum to move the holotype into storage, and in 1941, with a dwindling research budget, the American Museum sold the T. rex holotype to Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The price? $7,000 ($130,000 in today\u2019s currency) for what is by definition the first fossil of the world\u2019s most famous dinosaur.

Did you get to work with him? What was he like away from the microphone? ANSWER: Myron Cope would have been 96 on Jan. 23, and what appears below is what I wrote for Steelers.com after he died on Feb. 27, 2008. I believe that is the best way to attempt to answer your question:\n\nFor a generation of sports fans in Western Pennsylvania, Myron Cope was a voice on their radio, a voice they invited into their homes nightly, a voice they turned to when they wanted to know something about their favorite football team. He was a voice they trusted. \"I've often thought that, when I kick the bucket, there'd be a story that said, 'Creator of towel, dead.'\" Cope cracked during the news conference called to announce his retirement on June 21, 2005. \"Truthfully, I was gifted and educated to be a writer."

By B. Denise Hawkins\n\n|\n\nText Size:\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Carnegie Museum of Art acquired a vast record of African American life in Pittsburgh during the 20th century. It\u2019s a treasure trove of 70,000 print images, photo negatives, and videos from the iconic Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris, longtime photographer for The Pittsburgh Courier , one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Black newspapers, spanning the late \u201930s into the 1970s. As the museum worked to preserve and digitize the photos and identify the people portrayed in them, it organized temporary exhibitions of the collection in which viewers were treated to several dozen images at a time\u2014of dance halls and baseball games, intimate family moments and Civil Rights protests. Often, in a single frame and unfiltered, Harris presented the seldom-seen complexity and joy of African American life and identity. Each exhibition provided snippets of what is considered one of the country\u2019s most detailed and comprehensive photographic records of the Black urban experience. But there has never been a space that showcased all the facets of the archive at once, as Harris had always hoped. \u201cHarris wanted you to see it all, but he also wanted you to listen to the stories he was presenting in his art,\u201d says Charlene Foggie-Barnett, Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris community archivist. With every image, she adds, \u201cHe is leaving clues. He is revealing story lines and truths. He\u2019s making a statement.\u201d\n\nLater this year, museumgoers for the first time will be able to explore this vast archive with a reinstallation of Harris\u2019 work in the Scaife Galleries. The new Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris Archive Gallery will feature never-before-seen components of the archive, including reels of film in canisters, and prints, some in color. Visitors will even be able to view Harris\u2019 photographic negatives, which make up the bulk of the collection. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a more comprehensive, intentional, and creative approach to sharing and honoring the Teenie Harris Archive and how the photographer\u2019s art has illuminated the city\u2019s history,\u201d says Dana Bishop-Root, the museum\u2019s director of education and public programs, who worked with Foggie-Barnett and Curator of Photography Dan Leers, as well as a team of creatives, on the project. Throughout their work, which is ongoing, they considered how the museum invites, welcomes, and engages with the community\u2014including those who knew Harris, his subjects and their families, schoolchildren, teachers, scholars, and other visitors from near and far. \u201cThinking about the ways that people can experience the archive has been at the forefront of our approach to sharing it,\u201d says Bishop-Root. \u201cWe\u2019ve long said that people need the museum, but the museum needs people to keep it alive, inclusive, vibrant, and contemporary.\u201d\n\nViewing \u2018Teenie\u2019 as Never Before\n\nWhen the exhibition opens, Harris\u2019 films, works in color, self-portraits, negatives, and more will be available for visitors to work with, listen to, read about, see\u2014and yes, touch\u2014Leers says. For the first time, visitors will view Harris\u2019 videos and still images side by side, projected on a wall using a multichannel projector. Visitors can also interact with Harris\u2019 negatives, the thin strips of transparent plastic film that gave the photographer his first look at the subjects, using a light table stationed in the gallery. This opportunity to touch and explore the negatives is possible only because of the decades of intensive work that has gone into preserving the archive. Many of Harris\u2019 negatives were stored in his basement studio before the museum received them. \u201cThere were a group of negatives that were seriously curled up on each other and without protective sleeves,\u201d adds Leers. The work of restoring and digitizing them, which is nearly complete, has been intensive and daily over the past two decades. Pittsburghers first saw Harris\u2019 photos in black and white in the pages of The Pittsburgh Courier , the city\u2019s influential Black newspaper. For the first time, the museum will print some of those images on newsprint, giving visitors a look and feel for how Harris\u2019 photographs appeared when they rolled off the press. Experiencing the Charles \u201cTeenie\u201d Harris Archive Gallery will also include seeing the photographer as never before. Harris was a month shy of his 90th birthday when he died on June 12, 1998. But in exhibitions of his work, the artist is typically portrayed as a much younger man in his 30s\u2014bright-eyed, with finger waves in his black hair, and sporting his signature suit and tie. For the first time, the museum will present self-portraits, some in color, of Harris as an older man. \u201cDeciding to present portraits of the older Harris offered an opportunity for us to broaden the personal image of Harris, and who he was as a community member, family man, and artist,\u201d says Leers. Those new portraits of the photographer will be interspersed in a mosaic display that features Harris\u2019 life and career, layered with the major moments in Black history, American history, and international history he chronicled. The museum also wants to broaden and focus on the visitors who will be engaging with the work Harris created. \u201cDeciding to present portraits of the older Harris offered an opportunity for us to broaden the personal image of Harris, and who he was as a community member, family man, and artist.\u201d",
            "\u201cThere are photos from the unveiling where there are people shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d says Lamanna. Back in Pittsburgh, big things were in the works. \u201cMultiple sources cite the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and Carnegie\u2019s desire to display its mounted skeleton as a major driving force behind the construction of an expanded Carnegie Institute building,\u201d says Lamanna. In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall. Diplodocus carnegii finally had a forever home. \u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d says Tom Rea, author of Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Dinosaur . The display of real fossils\u2014not just casts\u2014is what made it momentous, explains Rea. Before long, word of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus spread like wildfire. And everybody wanted a piece. Dippy\u2019s World Tour\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the largest and most respected museums in the world were only just beginning to catch dino-fever. \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing time in science when you think about it,\u201d says Rea. \u201cThese were all temples of science,\u201d adds Rea, who is also editor and founder of WyoHistory.org, a project of the Wyoming Historical Society. \u201cThese big halls, with high ceilings and dramatic arches, and daylight coming down through the clerestory, and all that stuff that makes these spaces so fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nBut most of them had nothing like a Diplodocus . So when requests started to pour in from abroad, Carnegie again seized the moment. Before long, casts would be sent to some of the largest cities in the world. According to Rea, Berlin erected its Diplodocus cast in March 1908. Paris followed suit that June. The following year, Vienna and Bologna joined the trend, and then St. Petersburg in 1910, La Plata, Argentina, in 1912, Madrid in 1913, and Mexico City in 1930. For the vast majority of museumgoers of the day, it would be the first dinosaur they\u2019d ever laid eyes upon. \u201cThe cool thing about that is, most of these casts are still on display,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cWhen you think about all the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people that see Diplodocus carnegii casts every year in all these European cities, in Latin [and South] America, and couple that with the fact that these mounts have been on display in many cases for more than a century,\u201d says Lamanna, \u201cthis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nThe House That Dippy Built\n\nNo one is quite sure who first coined \u201cDippy\u201d as the nickname for Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus . \u201cI can tell you that the fossil preparator Arthur Coggeshall used the nickname in three articles he wrote in Carnegie magazine about the discovery and fame of D. carnegii in September, October, and November 1951,\u201d says Rea. Coggeshall had been connected to the museum for more than half a century at that point. In fact, he was on the original expedition in Wyoming when Dippy was discovered. Nieuwland adds that Coggeshall\u2019s boss, Holland, referred to the Diplodocus as \u201cOld Dip,\u201d but not Dippy. The one thing we do know is that pretty much as soon as the casts of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus started stomping around the world, some scientists took issue with how the mount stood. This was due, in part, to a notion of the day that dinosaurs would have stood like modern-day lizards and crocodiles\u2014low to the ground, with tail in tow and legs sprawled widely apart. But Holland, who started his career as a butterfly expert before doubling as the museum\u2019s paleontologist, contended in 1910 that the legs of Diplodocus held the animal higher off the ground, more like a mammal. \u201cUltimately, Holland\u2019s argument was proven correct,\u201d says Lamanna, who cites the subsequent discovery of fossilized sauropod trackways showing that the feet were placed close together as the deciding factor. \u201cAnd now everyone that knows or cares at all about sauropods reconstructs them with their legs underneath their bodies, like an elephant.\u201d\n\nMore changes came over time\u2014and some of them quite recently. Lamanna arrived at the museum in 2004 and at the time, the tail of Diplodocus carnegii still lay upon the ground. Worse still, it nearly touched the feet of a T. rex , a dinosaur that humans are closer to in time than Diplodocus would have been. \u201cSo this was wrong on two levels,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cFirst of all, the dinosaur\u2019s tail probably didn\u2019t touch the ground very much, if at all. And secondly, having the tail lap against the ankles of a 66-million-year-old dinosaur \u2026 I mean, you might as well have had a caveman riding the T. rex .\u201d\n\nGetting Dippy\u2019s tail off the ground\u2014and away from T. rex \u2014was just one of many changes that went into the creation of the museum\u2019s Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition, which opened in 2008 in a space triple the size of the original Dinosaur Hall. Among other changes, Lamanna and his colleagues also switched the bones in Dippy\u2019s forelimbs and added vertebrae in its tail, in keeping with the latest research. Elsewhere in the exhibition, scientists, artists, and fossil preparators transformed formerly two-dimensional fossils into three-dimensional works of art, including Dryosaurus elderae, Camptosaurus aphanoecetes , and Corythosaurus casuarius . Similarly, real fossil heads of Edmontosaurus regalis and Triceratops prorsus received cast bodies, bringing them to life. And it\u2019s not just the mounts, says Lamanna. The team has also worked to surround the dinos with plants, rocks, smaller animals, and other facets of the ecosystems they would have once inhabited to create a more immersive visitor experience. Of the roughly 230 objects now on display in Dinosaurs in Their Time , about 75 percent are real fossils, not casts, making this one of the most impressive paleontological exhibitions on Earth. Dippy: Teacher And Celebrity\n\nOf course, in paleontology, there will always be questions we can\u2019t answer. For instance, scientists have yet to find a Diplodocus carnegii head, meaning the one sported by Dippy currently is a cast of a skull of the related species Diplodocus longus . And remember, Dippy is already a composite skeleton\u2014meaning it\u2019s made up of multiple specimens. Lamanna\u2014who has helped discover and name much larger sauropods known as titanosaurs\u2014says that Dippy was the bedrock on which so much future paleontology would be built. \u201c Diplodocus is one of our first windows into sauropod biology,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe appearance, behavior, lifestyle, evolutionary relationships; when we do research on sauropods today, in a lot of ways we\u2019re standing on the shoulders of the people that did research on Diplodocus back in the day, and also Diplodocus itself.\u201d\n\nThe museum has also fully embraced Dippy\u2019s celebrity\u2014placing the dino in its logo and stationing a full-bodied gelcoat and fiberglass replica outside on Forbes Avenue. These days, the outdoor Dippy may be the one that gets the most attention, on account of its ever-changing accessories."

        "Question": "Who built Fort Pitt in 1761?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Traders and settlers",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town\", near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town\", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]:\u200a148\n\nAfter Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]\n\nThe Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]\n\nIncreasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4]\n\nWith the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4]\n\nAfter the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24]\n\nThe village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25]\n\nMany farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]\n\nIron City (1800\u20131859)\n\nCommerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]\n\nThe 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",

Figures with broadcasting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s Main article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers figures in broadcasting The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope , who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons ( 1970 \u2013 2004 ). [ 220 ] Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. Newspaper The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. [ 221 ] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. Usage in popular culture The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature.

The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20\u201328). Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE . [ 233 ] The protagonist of John Grisham 's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan.

[ 235 ] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'. The Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research The Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1\u00a0million. [ 236 ] The Foundation, started by Steelers president Art Rooney II, focuses on education and research regarding brain injuries and sports-related concussions.

This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger . The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the \" Steagles \"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag . The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \" Steelmark \", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland -based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three astroids ( hypocycloids of four cusps ). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel. [ 100 ] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. [ 101 ] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants , are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968 . The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997 , the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ( Futura Condensed ) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007\u20132011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007 . They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963 \u2013 1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season . The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season. [ 102 ] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed. [ 103 ] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then- Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. [ 104 ] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw . Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors. Rivals The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: ( Cleveland Browns , Baltimore Ravens , and Cincinnati Bengals ). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders , Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , New England Patriots , and Tennessee Titans . They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles , but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Divisional rivals Cleveland Browns Main article: Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9\u201331 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66\u201327\u20131 (including 42\u20136 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75\u201358\u20131; [ 108 ] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL",

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933\u2013present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season .

            "I love the pride of the organization, the fans. And walking through the Great Hall and seeing everything.\"\n\nThe 2022 football season is one Megan Zillweger-Jones will always hold close to her heart. Because it will be her first seasons as a Steelers season ticket holder. Zillweger-Jones put her name on the season ticket waiting list in 2002, and to her surprise, she received an email that told her tickets were available. She jumped at the opportunity. \"I was honestly shocked because it's been I so long I didn't even expect it anymore,\" said Zillweger-Jones, who lives in Saxonburg, Pa. \"My sister and her husband got their tickets last year. And until that point, I thought that the whole stadium was all seat licenses, and it would never happen. I thought I would be dead before my name came off the list. \"But, we got the email and my husband saw it first. He said to me, what do you think about the seats, did you see where they are? I'm like, what are you talking about? We got the season tickets. I thought he was kidding because he texted me and I hadn't seen the email yet.\"\n\nOnce she saw the email, though, she knew it wasn't a joke and was absolutely thrilled. \"I was like, get out of here,\" said Zillweger-Jones. \"We've been getting tickets through his college roommate. We've been buying tickets from him for the last couple of years. We've been able to go to some games but now to have our own seats and I'm so excited. \"I didn't realize, but evidently this was the second time that we've been given an offer and I didn't know that. I don't know how I missed the first one. I completely panicked because it said this is your second offer and if you don't accept it, you go to the bottom of the waitlist. I was panicking because I did not see the first email. I talked to the people in the ticket office and they were so helpful. I was thinking this is not happening. I finally get the chance to get tickets and I messed up and am going to get put to the bottom of the waitlist. \"But it all worked out. My niece is going to Pitt in the fall so my sister and her husband have seats. I'm excited that we'll be able to go to the games with family. I'm excited, and so are my kids, for what the future is.\"\n\nZillweger-Jones grew up cheering for the Steelers, something that started with her father and just grew throughout the years. It was that passion that was instilled in her which had her sign up for the season ticket waiting list, and the dream came true. \"I've always been a Steelers fan,\" said Zillweger-Jones. \"I grew up a Steelers fan thanks to my dad. His whole mood for the week depended on if the Steelers won on Sunday. Watching Steelers games was something we did as a family. My sister and I both loved watching the games and we both got on the list around the same time. She and her husband got their seats last year. We're getting our seats this year. So, I'm excited. That's something to continue with our families and her kids love football and my kids love it. It's a great family thing.\"\n\nZillweger-Jones love of the Steelers dates back to the 1970s, and the one thing she truly appreciates is the consistency within the organization. \"We'd go over to my uncle's house on Sunday and my cousins would be there and my dad and my uncle,\" she recalled. \"I remember watching the games with everybody when I was little. If we weren't home, they were on the radio. \"What I love is things are similar now to how they were then. I love integrity. I love the Rooney family has been the ownership from the beginning. They have always had integrity and loyalty with this team. I love that the team always seems to stay together. They seem to be a team more than individual players that are only there for themselves.\"\n\nAnd they are a team that she is still pinching herself that she is going to be able to watch in person all season \u2026 in her own seats. \"I don't know how long it'll take to set in that like these are our seats,\" said Zillweger-Jones."

The Prince (Jonathan Burton) is astonished to see Rusalka (Sara Gartland) in the forest, and isn't sure if she's a woman or a fairy tale. The witch Je\u017eibaba (Marianne Cornetti) shows the Wood Sprites the magic potion she is brewing for Rusalka.

View our full collectionof video excerpts onourRusalkaYouTube playlist. Videos by RLG Creations. SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS\n\nWarning - the following contains spoilers about the plot\n\nACT 1\n\nThe water sprite Rusalka has fallen in love with a human\u2014the Prince\u2014when he came to swim in her lake. Now she wants to become human herself and live on land to be with him. Rusalka\u2019s father, Vodn\u00edk the water goblin, is horrified and tells her that humans are evil and full of sin. When Rusalka insists, claiming they are full of love, he says she will have to get help from the witch Je\u017eibaba. Rusalka calls on the moon to tell the Prince of her love and then implores Je\u017eibaba for help. She agrees to turn Rusalka into a human\u2014but warns her that if she doesn\u2019t find love she will be damned and the man she loves will die. Also, by becoming mortal, Rusalka will lose her power of speech. Convinced that her feelings for the Prince can overcome all spells, Rusalka agrees and Je\u017eibaba gives her a potion to drink. As dawn breaks, the Prince appears with a hunting party and finds Rusalka by the lake. Even though she can't speak to him, he is captivated by her beauty and leads her away to his castle. From the lake, the voices of Vodn\u00edk and the other water sprites are heard, mourning the loss of Rusalka. ACT 2\n\nThe Prince demands to know why Rusalka is so cold towards him, though he remains determined to win her. A Foreign Princess, who has come for the wedding, is intent on winning the Prince for herself. She mocks Rusalka\u2019s silence and reproaches the Prince for ignoring his guests. The Prince demands Rusalka dress for the ball and escorts the Princess into the castle for the beginning of the festivities. Disconsolate, Rusalka falls into a disturbed sleep. Vodn\u00edk appears and sings of his grief at losing Rusalka. When she begs her father to help, telling him that the Prince no longer loves her, Vodn\u00edk has little to offer. The Prince enters with the Princess and confesses his love for her. When Rusalka intervenes, rushing into his arms, he rejects Rusalka. Vodn\u00edk warns the Prince of the fate that awaits him, then disappears into the watery depths with Rusalka. The Prince asks the Princess for help but she ridicules him and tells him to follow his bride into hell. ACT 3\n\nRusalka waits by the lake once again, lamenting her fate. Je\u017eibaba mocks her, then hands her a knife and explains that there is a way to save herself: she must kill the Prince. Rusalka refuses, throwing the weapon into the water and sinks into the lake in despair. The wood sprites enter, singing and dancing, but when Vodn\u00edk explains to them what has happened to Rusalka, they fall silent and disappear. The Prince, desperate and half crazy with remorse, emerges from the forest, looking for Rusalka and calling out for her to return to him. She appears from the water, reproaching him for his infidelity, and explains that now a kiss from her would kill him. Accepting his destiny, he asks her to kiss him to give him peace. She does, and he dies in her arms. Rusalka asks for mercy on his soul and disappears into the water.

Verdi\u2019sIl Trovatoreis an epic tale of love and sacrifice, deception and revenge. Manrico and the Count di Luna, on opposite sides of a civil war in 1400s Spain, don\u2019t know they are actually brothers. Both are in love with Leonora; she loves Manrico and spurns the Count\u2019s advances. Azucena is the tormented woman who raised Manrico. Years ago, the Count\u2019s father killed Azucena\u2019s mother. Azucena swore to avenge her mother\u2019s death, and will do whatever it takes to punish the Count and his family. After the Count captures Azucena, Manrico attempts to rescue her. When Manrico himself is then captured, Leonora tells the Count she will give herself to him in exchange for Manrico\u2019s freedom. But Leonora and Azucena each have deadly tricks up their sleeves, and are determined to have the last laughs.

Anderson, and his wife Sheree Lanihun-Anderson, started the Lanihun-Anderson Foundation to serve as a baseline of financial health and peace for others. Their mission is to bridge the financial disparity gap by providing knowledge, resources and opportunities to others. \"We started the foundation with a focus on financial literacy,\" said Anderson. \"Both of us have identified that a lot of people, especially in their early adult life, are distracted by trying to manage their finances and understand how to budget. Really simple principles that I think they would benefit greatly from if they learned those as early as possible. So, we try to target high school and middle school aged kids and just teach them fundamental financial literacy building blocks, like how to budget and what to do when you have a certain amount of money. When they get their first job, for example, they can build a structure that hopefully when they grow into having a professional income, that they have some understanding of what they want to do with their money so they can alleviate that stress and focus on the things that everybody has. Aptitudes that they are gifted with so they can focus on those things as opposed to figuring out how to do with finances.\"\n\nAnderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is. \"I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger,\" said Anderson. \"So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time.\"\n\nSpencer Anderson Cause: Autism Speaks\n\nSpencer Anderson's heart told him that the cause he chose for his cleats as a part of My Cause My Cleats was the right choice to make. While it's nothing that has touched his family directly, it has impacted several people close to him and that is why he selected Autism Speaks to represent with his cleats. \"I feel like it's one of those things that isn't talked about often enough,\" said Anderson. \"One of my close friends is autistic. I have known a lot of people growing up that were autistic. I feel like a lot of people don't understand. It's kind of frowned upon. People will whisper, will say he has autism you have to be easy with him. \"They are normal people. I have interacted with many of them. It's not talked about enough. The cases aren't as common as cancer, mental health, but it's something people should be aware of. \"I have a close family friend, a friend of my mom's, and she has a son who has been autistic his whole life. Interacting with him you know they are real people, they interact normally. They have their moments, but they can do good in society and in the world. It's not something that they should be looked down upon, or shunned, or turn a cold shoulder.\"\n\nAnderson welcomes the opportunity to be an advocate for those with autism, whether it's through his cleats or just in daily life. He knows they are the same as him, people who can lead a normal life, but just might have some obstacles to overcome as they do. \"They can be way smarter than most of us,\" said Anderson. \"I went to school with someone who had autism and he was way smarter than all of us. You could have jar of marbles, and he could just look at it and tell you the number of marbles in the jar and he would be right. You would be, like, wow.",

            "Guide to Pittsburgh Greek Food Festivals | 2024 Menus, Hours and Highlights | Visit Pittsburgh. Insider's Guide to Pittsburgh Greek Food Festivals. When it comes to Greek food, it's not all Greek to me. Names like spanakopita, moussaka, pastitsio speak to me just like the Sirens spoke to hungry sailors in the Odyssey. But without the evil overtones.",
            "Except for the Ouzo hangover and maybe the calories. Greek food festival season normally runs from May-early Sept. each year in Pittsburgh at locations throughout the city and surrounding neighborhoods. To make life easy and maximize the time you can fill up on loukoumades (my personal favorite of bite-size donut balls drizzled with honey and cinnamon) here's your guide to the 2024 Greek food festival season. Visiting this page after festival season? Hit up Christo's or The Simple Greek in Downtown Pittsburgh for these flavors year-round. St. Nicholas Greek Food Festival. May 12-18, 2024 | Menu | Order Online.

In just one bite you'll see why this festival has now been going on for 60+ years. Pro Tip: Head inside to find the dinners and a la carte options (their spanakopita and green beans yiahni are my two favorites) or go to the outdoor grill for gyros, Greek fries and salads. All Saints Greek Food Festival. June 3-7, 2024. Greek dancing, live music, tons of vendors, and, oh yeah, the food is incredible too.

Delivering mouthwatering Greek classics to hungry Aliquippans for almost 50 years, Kimisis Tis Theotokou Greek Orthodox Church is a great stop northwest of the city. Grab their lamb shank for a full dinner served with orzo, salad and pita or find ala carte bliss with some of the best moussaka (eggplant and ground beef in a cream sauce) and pastitsio (the same but with pasta instead of eggplant) you'll find anywhere! Oakmont Greek Festival. June 28-30 2024 | Online Ordering and Curbside Available. This Greek festival is so good I plan my summer travel around it so I never have to miss a year. My recommendation is to get to the Oakmont Greek Festival early and have a plan: one to the dessert line, one to the drinks and one to the main courses, then meet at the table and enjoy all together. Follow your nose to some of the best loukoumades (honey balls, be generous on the cinnamon) in the region and their signature chicken alexis glazed, with fruit and honey. Annual Savor the Flavors of Greece. July 12, 2024. You only have one day to enjoy this parish festival from Saint Spyridon in Monessen, but just trust me that it's worth the drive. Unique favorites here include the psari plaki (baked cod presented Greek style), giouvetsi (orzo pasta and fresh veggies in a light tomato sauce) and gyros so good they have to sell them in their own tent!

        "Question": "Who named Pittsburgh after the British statesman William Pitt the Elder?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "General John Forbes",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "(1986). Pitt: the Story of the University of Pittsburgh, 1787\u20131987 . Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. p. 135. ISBN 0-8229-1150-7 .",
            "Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930. Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared\u2014a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries\u2014though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important\u2014and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important."

That is what I carry with me today.\"\n\nTo this day, Perry is a fan of the Steelers, someone who even through his busy days with the New York Knicks always manages to carve out time to watch games. He has seen the team play in person at Heinz Field and on the road and has made the trip to Saint Vincent College for training camp. It's special to him, part of his life, part of his DNA. \"I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, but from the day I can remember I saw black and gold at home,\" said Perry. \"We always watched the Steelers any time we could get them on television there. That is who I watched. Still to this day. I wish my dad was alive to see Mike Tomlin who has been coaching this team for a long time. How proud he would be of someone like him and what he stands for and what he has brought to the team and organization over the last 15 years. (General Manager) Kevin Colbert and Mike have been so kind to me. I have come and watched them work, learned from them, and it's a good escape for me from what I do.",

            "And we did it.\"\n\nThat, they did. They were honored at the Ireland Funds Pittsburgh Gala this year, receiving the Patricia R. Rooney Community Impact Award, given to leaders who have produced successful organizational initiatives in response to a significant contemporary problem. The foundation focuses on so many issues, from education to mental health, physical education to nutritional needs.",
            "\"Usually everybody knows somebody who is dealing with it hard to deal with because it affects our loved ones. \"Doing this, bringing attention to them, it doesn't bring back the person you lost, but hopefully can help one another person.\"\n\nAlex Highsmith Cause: Highsmith Family Foundation and International Justice Mission\n\nFor Alex Highsmith, giving back is something that comes naturally to him, a reflection of the way he was raised. So, when it came to deciding on his cleats, he knew he wanted to spread the awareness around, not just focusing on one area, but two. He is representing the Highsmith Family Foundation and the Internation Justice Mission (IJM) with his cleats, two causes that touch his heart deeply. The Highsmith Family Foundation does work in the Pittsburgh area, as well as his hometown and college towns of Wilmington and Charlotte, North Carolina. \"Our mission is to give back and to impact the youth in those areas,\" said Highsmith. \"I know how important it is to invest in the next generation in so many different ways. And so that's just something that's important to me.\"\n\nHighsmith has hosted multiple back to school events through his foundation and has also helped those in the community who are struggling, including the homeless. \"Ultimately, I know that I can make a lasting difference in the community,\" said Highsmith. \"Just by going out and doing different things with the kids and being a role model for them, that's what matters to me most.\"\n\nHighsmith has also been involved with bringing attention to IJM, a global organization that protects people in poverty from violence. They partner with local authorities in 16 countries to combat trafficking and slavery, violence against women and children and police abuse of power. \"This is an important issue today that's not talked about enough,\" said Highsmith. \"I wore my cleats for them last year and I wanted to do it again just because I think it's important to continue to raise awareness. It's still going on and something that still needs to be talked about.\"\n\nMiles Killebrew Cause: Caf\u00e9 Momentum\n\nAs a member of the Steelers Social Justice Committee, special teams captain Miles Killebrew has taken the time to truly learn about organizations in the Pittsburgh area that are trying to make a difference in the lives of at-risk youth. One such organization is Caf\u00e9 Momentum, something that sounds like a great place to grab a meal, but it's so much more. \"I decided to partner with them this year just because I'm a huge believer in what they're doing. I'm a big fan of their work in the community. We are a community partner with them already. I just wanted to double down on that and just kind of reinforce my stance on being supportive of them. Caf\u00e9 Momentum Pittsburgh opened in 2023 as a place where Pittsburghers can go and enjoy fine dining. More than that, it offers a culinary internship to teens 15 to 19 who are justice-involved. Caf\u00e9 Momentum, which originated in Dallas, provides a transformative experience through a 12-month paid post-release internship program. Participants rotate through the restaurant, focusing on life and social skills, coaching and development. Their mission is to transform young lives by equipping Pittsburgh's justice-involved youth with life skills, education and employment opportunities to help them achieve their full potential. \"I actually was at the downtown location recently and we were able to just talk,\" said Killebrew. \"I was able to meet with one of the interns. And it was a really great time. I presented him, Nico was his name, with a pair of cleats just for him. So, it was a cool moment. \"I'm really excited about the work that they're doing in Pittsburgh and fully stand behind them 100 percent.\"\n\nWhat Killebrew appreciates is the organization is giving kids a chance, kids who were impacted in some way or another through the justice system. \"I find in a lot of cases, these youth, they just need someone to believe in them and to offer them an alternative,\" said Killebrew. \"That's what they're doing there."

Cultural and historic resources have a significant impact on Pittsburgh's character. They are valuable, non-replaceable assets that contribute to a unique and distinct sense of place. City Planning's Historic Preservation work is guided by PreservePGH, the Pittsburgh Cultural Heritage Plan, completed in 2012. PreservePGH's vision statement:\n\nIn the 21st century, Pittsburgh's distinct character and culture will be preserved in ways that contribute to a high quality of life. The City will offer a balance of tradition and innovation, preservation and new construction, environmental sensitivity and continued use of resources. Pittsburgh's place in history will be admired and reflected for centuries to come - in the City's historic structures - in the waters of the three rivers - in the materials of modern buildings - in the hearts and minds of all Pittsburghers. If you're interested in doing exterior work on a property that's located in a City-designated Historic District, approval by the Historic Review Commission is required. This process is called development review. Development review is required for:\n\nDevelopment reviews are not required for:\n\nThe first step is completing a Building & Development Application (BDA) Application online at OneStopPGH and paying the appropriate filing fee. An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) is also required to be submitted as part of the OneStopPGH BDA application. Please upload the Certificate of Appropriateness Application form within the OneStopPGH portal. Prior to submitting your application, visit the Historic Nomination & Designation page. Scroll to List of City of Pittsburgh Designated Site and Districts to find your District and view the associated Design Guidelines. Historic Nomination & Designation: https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Historic-Preservation/Historic-Nominations\n\nApplications must be received at least 13 business days prior to the next available HRC hearing date. In order to confirm your project in on the agenda, verify your application has been received by emailing historicreview@pittsburghpa.gov . Only complete applications are included on agendas. If an application is determined by staff to be incomplete, staff will note which specific items are required to continue the project review.

        "Question": "What is the name of Sidney Crosby's role in the Pittsburgh Penguins?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Hockey player",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "URL: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/crosby-adds-another-title-to-legendary-international-resume\n\nTITLE: Crosby Adds Another Title to Legendary International Resume | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nAhead of the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game between the U.S. and Canada, Evgeni Malkin went into detail about why Mike Sullivan \u2013 behind the bench for Team USA \u2013 is such a good coach. \u201cBecause he loves hockey,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cWe know he cares about the team. He cares about every player. Six or 7 AM every day, he\u2019s in the office. He\u2019s watching video, he\u2019s talking to other coaches. He\u2019s trying to control everything. He loves hockey so much. He deserves everything. He wins two Cups. Maybe he wins and represents his country.\u201d\n\nBut when deciding whether his coach or captain would emerge victorious, Malkin had to go with longtime teammate, best friend and brother, Sidney Crosby:\n\n\u201cI know Sid and Sully, it\u2019s hard choice. But I think Canada will win.\u201d\n\nMalkin was right, as Canada defeated the United States in overtime, 3-2, at Boston\u2019s TD Garden on Thursday. Connor McDavid scored the winner 8:18 in to cap off a tournament that\u2019s had a tremendous impact on the sport of hockey. \u201cEvery opportunity you get to wear the Canadian jersey and compete in this event, it\u2019s something new, but I think you saw the hockey that was on display. It was pretty incredible,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cJust happy for this group. We came together in a short period of time, and found a way to get it done.\u201d\n\nA very proud captain \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/YkTuMATW6d\n\nCrosby, the oldest player in the tournament at 37 years old, finished tied for second in points among all players \u2013 picking up one goal and four assists in four games. His passion for the game still burns strong as ever, \u201cand getting an opportunity to play with these guys \u2013 how can you not be motivated by that?\u201d Crosby said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty special group, and happy for Connor to get that goal. He\u2019s an incredible player, and stepped up big when we needed him.\u201d\n\nAs did Crosby, who can now add 4 Nations Face-Off Champion to his Team Canada resume ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. The Golden Goal scorer in the 2010 Games, Crosby followed that up by wining gold in Sochi in 2014. He has also won gold medals in the World Cup of Hockey (2016), World Championship (2015) and World Junior Championship (2005). Crosby simply has not lost big games on the international stage, going 48-6 in his career wearing the maple leaf. SIDNEY CROSBY A CANADIAN LEGEND WINS WEARING THE MAPLE LEAF ONCE AGAIN \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 #4Nations pic.twitter.com/8MxQcS6z4y\n\nPenguins assistant general manager Jason Spezza was teammates with Crosby at that World Championship, and remembers how everyone wanted to be at their best, because they didn\u2019t want to let him down, knowing he\u2019d be at his best. \u201cI think it's a special quality that he has that not many people I've been around have,\u201d said Spezza, who played 19 NHL seasons.",
            "It's exciting. I'm excited to get going, for sure.\u201d\n\nTommy Novak is ready to get started \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/d1dZtruMht\n\nNovak adds some center depth to the group, lining up in the middle behind Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, with Danton Heinen on his left and Emil Bemstrom on his right in Pittsburgh\u2019s 4-0 loss ( full recap here ). \u201cYou can see the skill level he has,\u201d Head Coach Mike Sullivan said. \u201cHe gets a Grade-A look on a 2-on-1. Just misses his mark. But he made a few plays. He has good tight-area skills. I think he skates well. There\u2019s a lot to like there.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Hockey Operations group was thrilled to bring Novak into the mix. At 27 years old, he\u2019s a younger member of this particular group. He has good size at 6-1 and 179 pounds, and produced some solid campaigns in Nashville, who drafted him in the third round back in 2015. After four years of college hockey at Minnesota, Novak made his NHL debut in 2021. Since then, only three Predators have scored more goals or notched more points than Novak. His best season came during the 2023-24 campaign where he set career highs across the board in goals (18), assists (27) and points (45). While this year has been a relatively down one for Novak, he still picked up 13 goals in 52 games before the trade. \u201cI think as a puck carrier, I see the ice well and try to make plays offensively,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThis year, it's been a little hard to come by, but I think just making plays offensively, I move my feet, get my feet into it, and just try to create some chances for my teammates and for myself.\u201d\n\nWhile Sullivan said they were looking forward to familiarizing themselves even more with Novak\u2019s game, Phil Tomasino knows it pretty well, having played with him in the Predators organization. \u201cHe's an awesome player, obviously an awesome guy as well,\u201d Tomasino said. \u201cJust so skilled with the puck. I got the chance to play with him quite a bit in Nashville, in the minors and with the big club as well. Just makes plays. I mean, he's so silky with the puck and just makes everyone around him better. So, we're really excited to have him.\u201d\n\nTomasino reached out to Novak right away, as his trade to Pittsburgh back in November was also the first of his career. But just like Tomasino, he\u2019s looking forward to a fresh start after some tough sledding. \u201cObviously, things didn't go to plan at all. So, changes were made. I'm in Pittsburgh now, and I'm excited to be here for sure,\u201d Novak said. \u201cComing to such a storied franchise and to play with such great players \u2013 it's an honor to play for this franchise. I'm really excited to get going.\u201d\n\n================================================================================\n\nURL: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/penguins-re-sign-defenseman-ryan-shea-to-a-one-year-contract-extension\n\nTITLE: Penguins Re-Sign Defenseman Ryan Shea to a One-Year Contract Extension | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins have re-signed defenseman Ryan Shea to a one-year contract extension, it was announced today by President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Kyle Dubas. The contract runs through the 2025-26 season and carries an average annual value of $900,000. Shea, 28, has played in 28 games with Pittsburgh this season, tallying career highs across the board with two goals, three assists and five points. The defenseman recorded his first career two-goal game on February 23 against the New York Rangers and skated in a career-high 23:48 minutes on March 2 against Toronto. Shea has played in 59 career NHL games, all with Pittsburgh over the past two seasons, and has tallied three goals, three assists and six points. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound defenseman has appeared in 186 career American Hockey League games between the Texas Stars and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, totaling 72 points (12G-60A). The Milton, Massachusetts native played four seasons (2016-20) with Northeastern University (NCAA). Shea was originally drafted by Chicago in the fourth round (121st overall) of the 2015 NHL Draft. ================================================================================\n\nURL: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/penguins-ready-to-shift-from-asset-collection-to-execution\n\nTITLE: Penguins Ready to Shift from Asset Collection to Execution | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nOver the last year, Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas and his staff have accrued assets, flexibility and cap space as they work to return the Penguins to contention as soon as possible. This week alone, which culminated with the NHL trade deadline on Friday, Pittsburgh collected a number of draft picks after the moves they made \u2013 which were:\n\nAt this point, no team has more draft picks or selections in the first three rounds over the next three NHL Drafts than Pittsburgh. \u201cTriples of the third (round) of (2025), triples of the second (round) in (2026) and triples again of the third (round) of (2027). Triples is best,\u201d Dubas said with a smile. Now, the Penguins will start executing on the haul they\u2019ve collected, guided by this main question: what\u2019s in the best interest of the team? For example, it won\u2019t be feasible for the Penguins to use every single draft pick and expect all of those players to become part of the club sooner rather than later. Instead, they\u2019ll make picks available for trade. \u201cIf there are opportunities to use the excess capital that we\u2019ve accumulated, whether it\u2019s cap space or draft picks or to add players to the program to help propel it ahead, we won\u2019t hesitate to do that,\u201d said Dubas, who understands that being sellers at the trade deadline is not what fans are used to in Pittsburgh, and said this can\u2019t be the norm every year. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always come in and said there is no ambition on my end to have this take any longer than it needs to take, both for the city and for the people who have put in a lot. That\u2019s not just players, but staff that has been around for a long time."

In 2020, the Titans ranked in the top \ufb01ve in the League in plays of 50+ yards (10, 1st), pass plays of 50+ yards (8, 1st), o\ufb00ensive EPA (140.01, 2nd), total o\ufb00ense (396.4, 2nd), rushing o\ufb00ense (168.1, 2nd), yards/rush (5.2, 2nd), red-zone e\ufb03ciency (75.0, 2nd), rushing EPA (-0.42, 3rd), runs of 20+ yards (20, 3rd), yards/play (6.2, 4th), passing EPA (139.28, 4th), runs of 10+ yards (70, 4th) and third-down conversion rate (46.2, 5th). Smith guided a Tennessee o\ufb00ense that averaged 2.86 points/drive in 2020, which not only led the NFL, but also ranks as the eighth-best single-season mark in the League since 2000. The Titans scored TDs on 35.9% of its drives that season, which ranks as the fourth-best single-season mark in the League since 2000. Smith also oversaw one of the most potent rushing attacks as Derrick Henry became just the eighth player in League history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a single season. Henry's 2,027 rushing yards ranks \ufb01fth all-time and paced the Titans to the League's second-best rushing o\ufb00ense in 2020. Tennessee was among the League's best in the red zone in Smith's two-years as o\ufb00ensive coordinator. The Titans' 75.6 (2019) and 75.0 (2020) red-zone TD percentages are the fourth and \ufb01fth-best single-season marks in the NFL since 2000. Smith also helped revitalize the career of Ryan Tannehill. In two seasons running Smith's o\ufb00ense, Tannehill started 26 games and registered 6,561 passing yards with 55 TDs, 13 interceptions and a 110.6 passer rating, while completing 67.3 percent of his passes. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the \ufb01rst time in his career in 2019 after leading the NFL with a 117.5 passer rating and was named the Comeback Player of the Year by both the Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers of America. Smith also fostered the development of A.J. Brown, who eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in each of his \ufb01rst two seasons in the NFL and scored 19 TDs in 30 games. In 2019, Tennessee led the NFL in red-zone e\ufb03ciency (75.6 percent), ranked third in rushing o\ufb00ense (138.9 yards per game), and fourth in yards/play (6.12). The Titans' percentage in the red zone was the highest since the 2013 Denver Broncos (76.1). Tannehill and Henry became the fourth set of NFL teammates to lead the League in passer rating and rushing yards, respectively, since the current passer rating system was implemented in 1973. Smith served under four di\ufb00erent Titans head coaches, working his way up from his 2011 position of defensive assistant/quality control coach. He also spent time as an o\ufb00ensive assistant/quality control coach (2012), o\ufb00ensive line/tight ends assistant (2013), and assistant tight ends coach (2014-15) before taking over as tight ends coach during the 2015 season and holding the position through 2018. Prior to joining the Titans, Smith spent two years as the defensive quality control coach for the Washington Commanders under Joe Gibbs (2007-08). In addition to his coaching role, he also worked as a college scouting assistant in Washington in 2007. In 2010, Smith worked at Ole Miss as an administrative assistant/defensive intern, working primarily with the linebackers. Born and raised in Memphis, Tenn., Smith graduated from North Carolina where he played o\ufb00ensive line and later joined the Tar Heels coaching sta\ufb00 as a graduate assistant (2006), working with the o\ufb00ensive line. Smith and his wife, Allison, have two sons, Tanner and Liam, and one daughter, Sophie. Club Links\n\nNFL Clubs\n\nMore NFL Sites\n\n\u00a9 2025 Pittsburgh Steelers."

        "Question": "What was the name of the first steel and concrete ballpark used by the Pirates?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Forbes Field",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation. [ 30 ] Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field. [ 31 ] When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth 's career on May 25, 1935 [ 35 ] and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series . The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh \"Pitt\" Panthers . Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE , although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium . In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit. [ 38 ] LECOM Park , which hosts the Pirates' Spring Training games Spring Training [ edit ] Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida , which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders . Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach , which dates to 1914. [ 39 ] It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park , built in 1912, and Wrigley Field , built in 1914. [ 40 ] Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights. [ 41 ] The park was formerly named \"McKechnie Field,\" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie , who led the Pirates in 1925 ; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine , which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania , and also a campus in Bradenton. [ 42 ] Pirate City , the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park. Logos and uniforms [ edit ] 1888: \"Alleghenys\" Logo 1900\u20131906 1907 1908\u20131909 1915\u20131919 1921, 1932 1922 1923\u20131931 1933\u20131935 1948\u2013present Uniform design in the 1940s The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century. [ 43 ] During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket. [ 43 ] The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942. [ 43 ] In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League . The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924, [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] but the change did not last beyond that season. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Along with the San Francisco Giants , the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009. In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds ), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit). [ 43 ] The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch. Willie Stargell wearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes . After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. [ 43 ] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys , following the Oakland Athletics . Starting in 1977 , the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The",
            "first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season . Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960 . They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees , yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente , the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971 . Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass . In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. [ 16 ] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970 , 1971 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 , and 1979 . Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell , Dave Parker , and Al Oliver , the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990. The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , and Doug Drabek . The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992 . Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. Andrew McCutchen , 2012 With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park , did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen , defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game . They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals . That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. [ 17 ] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th [ 18 ] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies , Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs . [ 19 ] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Ballpark [ edit ] Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium , a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. [ 20 ] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services . [ 21 ] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game , when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130. PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; [ 26 ] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, [ 27 ] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente , who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell , Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge , or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station , located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. Former ballparks [ edit ] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park , located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park , which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.

Pittsburgh has been recognized as a top spot for travel in 2025 by renowned travel guide publisher \ufeffLonely Planet. Pittsburgh was the only U.S. city to earn a top spot on Lonely Planet\u2019s Global Best in Travel 2025 list , a prestigious annual selection that highlights the world's top destinations, travel experiences, and trends. Lonely Planet\u2019s Global Best in Travel 2025 list: https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel#pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh continues to evolve while constantly reminding all who experience it of its rich history. From the iconic entrance into the city from the Fort Pitt Tunnel or that first peek at the top of the U.S. Steel Tower when I-279 curves, that \u201cparticular brand of magic\u201d captivates all who see the Steel City for the first and hundredth time. In what started as a fort built during the French and Indian War, Pittsburgh earned much of its personality today by once being the center of the American steel industry - it\u2019s where the name of the Steelers came from, after all. The grit that came with working in the steel mills can still be felt in the community, from Fairywood to the East Hills. If you want to feel integrated as a Pittsburgher, there\u2019s something special about walking through the City\u2019s Strip District on a Steelers Sunday. What better way to capture the yinzer spirit than with a Primanti\u2019s sandwich at the original location in the Strip, stacked high with vinegar-based coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries? We recommend, ironically enough, the Pitts-Burger. Can\u2019t stomach fries on a sandwich? Then try it on a salad in classic Pittsburgh style. It\u2019s good for the soul. Whatever your taste, Pittsburgh has something for everyone. Take one of the inclines up Mt. Washington and check out the city skyline from the overlooks before stopping for a bite to eat with a view.

            "........................................................ 26\n\n4\n\nAMUSEMENT TAX\n\nREGULATIONS\n\nARTICLE I\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSECTION 101 \u2013 DEFINITIONS\n\nAMUSEMENT \u2013 all manner and forms of diversion, sport, pastime, and entertainment, including, but not limited to, concerts, shows, theatres, piers, exhibitions, movies, vaudeville, circus, carnival and side shows; all forms of entertainment at fair grounds and amusement parks; race tracks, contests or feats of talent or skill, athletic contests including wrestling matches, boxing and sparring exhibitions, football, basketball and baseball games, skating, golfing, tennis, hockey, bathing, swimming, archery, shooting, riding, dancing and all other forms of diversion, sport, recreation or pastime; shows, exhibitions, contests, displays and games, and all other methods of obtaining admission charges, donations, contributions or monetary charges of any character, from the general public or a limited or selected number thereof, directly or indirectly, in return for other than tangible property, or specific personal professional services. The term amusement includes admission fees paid to access places of entertainment, exhibition, or amusement or to a sporting event or show. The term amusement specifically includes trade shows, exhibitions, builder or homes shows, equipment shows, craft shows, and tasting events. The term amusement does not include any Exempt Amusement or any amusement located outside the City limits. In the case of an amusement that is mobile or located outdoors, an amusement is located in the City limits if the event either begins or ends within the City limits. By way of example, but not intended as comprehensive definition of amusement, a restaurant, bar, tavern, pub, lounge, motel, or hotel is not a place of amusement if it merely offers incidental recorded music or TV broadcasts to patrons. A restaurant, bar, tavern, pub, lounge, motel, or hotel is a place of amusement if it offers entertainment such as music, dance, performing arts, sing-alongs, or comedy routines, or restricted sporting events not available on broadcast TV, such as title boxing matches, to patrons. ESTABLISHED PRICE - regular monetary charge of any character, including donations and contributions, fixed and exacted or in any manner received by Producers, as herein defined, from the general public or a limited or selected number thereof, directly or indirectly, for the privilege of attending or engaging in any amusement, provided that;\n\n1. When amusement is conducted in any roof garden, night club, cabaret, bar, brewery, restaurant or other place where the charge for admission, wholly or in part, is included in the price paid for refreshment, service or merchandise, the amount paid for admission to the amusement shall be deemed to be ten (10%) percent of the amount paid for refreshment, service and merchandise;\n\n2. When amusement is conducted at a social club or fraternal organization which also furnishes entertainment for which a separate charge is not made, the established price shall be fifty (50%) percent of the gross receipts;\n\n5\n\n3. Where admission to any amusement sponsored by an Institution of Purely Public Charity is obtained, solely or partly by donation, contribution and other charge, if members of the general public are admitted and the amusement is not an Exempt Amusement, the established price for amusement for purposes of the tax shall be twenty-five (25%) percent of the total donation, contribution and other monetary charge. 4. Separately stated charges for the rental of tangible personal property, where such charges reflect market pricing for such rentals, such as the rental of sports equipment by a Producer offering recreation, are not part of the Established Price and are not subject to Amusement Tax. If the Producer collects sales tax from the patron for the rental, such will establish that the rental price reflects market pricing. EXEMPT AMUSEMENTS\n\n1. The term amusement shall not include private affairs sponsored by nonprofit organizations for members and their guests at which the admission charges or contribution approximate the expenses and the net proceeds, net of reasonable expenses, inure exclusively to benefit the nonprofit organization. However, if members of the general public are invited to the private affair, the event is not an Exempt Amusement, unless the event qualifies as an Exempt Performing Arts Production. See Section 201(c). 2. The term amusement shall not include an Exempt Performing Arts Production. 3. The term amusement shall not include admissions to places of amusement where the primary purpose of the admission or event is to provide scientific, historical, or educational material to the patron so long as no material entertainment or recreation is provided. Admission charges to lectures of a scientific, historical or educational nature, such as continuing education courses, when such lectures are produced or conducted by nonprofit associations or clubs are not subject to the tax. However, admission fees to places that provide food or drink, including alcoholic beverages, but do not otherwise provide entertainment or recreation, are not Exempt Amusements if the primary purpose of the event is to market or showcase one or more commercial products, even if ancillary historical, scientific or educational material also is provided to the patron. Admission fees to tasting events that offer food or drink, but do not offer entertainment or recreation, are Exempt Amusements if the Producer collects sales or drink taxes from the patron based on the admission charge or contribution. 4. The term amusement shall not include any admission fee or charge paid for the sale of admission to or for the privilege of admission to a bowling alley or bowling lane to engage in one or more games of bowling. The term amusement shall not include real property rented for camping purposes. The term amusements shall not include membership dues, fees or assessments paid by patrons to engage in activities, the predominant purpose or nature of which is exercise, fitness, health maintenance, improvement or rehabilitation, heath or nutrition education, or weight control. However, the patron must participate in this health related activity to qualify for the exemption. The term amusements shall not include membership dues, fees or assessments of charitable, religious, beneficial or nonprofit organizations paid by patrons, such as sportsmen, recreational, golf or tennis clubs. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S.",
            "6\n\n5. The term amusement shall not include any activity that the City is prohibited from taxing by reason of the U S Constitution, federal law, or laws of the Commonwealth. Should any Producer claim that any amusement is exempt from the tax under this subsection, the Producer shall note the exemption on its filed return and provide a reference to the governing law. EXEMPT PERFORMING ARTS PRODUCTION \u2013 a Performing Arts event where the Producer is an Institution of Purely Public Charity and the proceeds, net of reasonable expenses, inure exclusively to the Institutions of Purely Public Charity. This exemption began in 2008."

            "Cookie List\n\nURL: https://www.steelers.com/news/a-connection-like-no-other\n\nCONTENT:\n\nSteelers Nation Unite\n\nA connection like no other\n\nSteelers.com\n\nJim Zimmerman Sr. got a surprise of a lifetime when he was honored before the Steelers-Eagles game as the winner of the Steelers 2022 Fan of the Year for his love and passion for the team. \"I almost cried,\" said Zimmerman of getting news on the field before the game from linebacker T.J. Watt. \"I never expected anything like this in my life. That was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\nBut his love and passion for the team is just the tip of the iceberg as to why he was selected as the winner this year. Zimmerman is a man who bleeds black and gold. He is Pittsburgh born and bred, and he loves all of his Pittsburgh sports teams, with the Steelers as close to his heart as anything in life is. It's his passion, his joy, his way to find happiness. On the flip side, one of his newest and closest friends, Bill Soloway loves his Philadelphia sports teams, and has a passion for the Eagles as he is a diehard fan who was born and raised in the Philadelphia area. But despite his love for the Eagles, he is quick to admit his heart is with the Steelers. And it's all because of Zimmerman. * *\n\nAbout nine years ago, Soloway was given a diagnosis that changed his entire life. He was diagnosed with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that took the life of his brother and his mother, and now was threatening his own life after he suffered congestive heart failure. The outlook was grim and Soloway was in a state of panic. As the primary care giver for his 85-year-old father, John, he didn't know what would happen if his life was cut short like others he loved. Without many choices, Soloway met with doctors and experts at Gift of Life Donor Program in Philadelphia about the potential of a heart transplant. He knew the odds were stacked against him, but it was his only hope. \"So many people die every day waiting for a life-saving heart transplant,\" said Soloway. \"I didn't want to be a statistic. It's pretty nerve wracking in some instances. \"My quality of life deteriorated to the point where I couldn't do things. I just kind of existed. I was limited in what I could do. Just to walk five steps was a major undertaking. It was like climbing a flight of steps to just going from one room to another and I would get winded."

        "Question": "What was the name of the settlement established by the British after capturing Fort Duquesne?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Fort Pitt",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town\", near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town\", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]:\u200a148\n\nAfter Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]\n\nThe Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]\n\nIncreasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4]\n\nWith the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4]\n\nAfter the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24]\n\nThe village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25]\n\nMany farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]\n\nIron City (1800\u20131859)\n\nCommerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]\n\nThe 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",

            "\u00a7 7307.21. An unincorporated entity, with one or more owners, that has made the federal \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d election to be taxed as a \u201ccorporation\u201d is not a Partnership but it may be an Employer. PASSIVE INCOME \u2013 Items of income earned by a Partner or Self-employed person from interest (not derived from working capital investments), dividends, capital gains (except for an individual who is considered a trader and not an investor), ground rents, royalties associated with the development of natural resources through a non-operating interest, retirement income earned after retirement, and real estate rental income where substantial services are not provided to tenants, is non-taxable Passive Income. In determining whether any portion of net profits from a Business may constitute Compensation or non-taxable Passive Income, the Treasurer will follow the guidance issued under Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. \u00a7 7303(a), and the PA Personal Income Tax Return Guide, except where such guidance is inconsistent with the purposes of the Payroll Tax. Income earned by a Partner or by a Self-employed person, is not Passive Income if the business provides professional services (e.g. law, accounting, architectural, professional engineering, actuarial, or medical services) or personal services to customers, unless the Partner or Self-Employed person is retired, based on age or years of service, and does not provide services to the business. Guaranteed Payments made to a Partner are not Passive Income. Payments made to a retiring Partner under Section 736 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 736, are Passive Income. The Passive Income\n\n6\n\nexclusion only applies to Partners and Self-employed persons, but not to Employees whose Compensation is reported to the taxing authorities on a Form W-2 or Form 1099-MISC. PAYROLL EXPENSE \u2013 the total Compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net distributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals who during any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of Pittsburgh. Employee contributions and deductions resulting from an employee election, whether deferred or otherwise, to qualified cash or deferred arrangements, such as an Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) retirement plan or Internal Revenue Code Section 125 \u201ccafeteria plan\u201d, do not reduce total Compensation. Compensation meeting the definition of earned income would be part of the Payroll Expense Tax associated with a particular Employee who is not a Partner or a Self-employed person. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.501 (\u201cEarned Income\u201d). The Payroll Tax is on gross payroll of the Employer. The Employers\u2019 portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insurance premiums, retirement plan contributions, etc., are not part of taxable gross payroll. The Payroll Expense of a Partner or Self-employed person is the cumulative annual Taxable Distributions associated with each separate Business carried on within the City rather than \u201cEarned Income\u201d as defined in 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.501. PERSON \u2013 a corporation, Partnership, Partner, Self-employed individual, business trust, association, unincorporated entity, estate, trust, foundation or natural person. Whenever used in any provision prescribing a fine or penalty the word \u201cperson\u201d as applied to Partnerships, shall mean the Partners thereof, and as applied to corporations and unincorporated associations, shall mean the officers thereof. A Governmental Entity is not a Person. SELF-EMPLOYED \u2013 an individual who earns Compensation from one or more separate Businesses carried on within the City, other than as an Employee or as a Partner. The single member owner of an unincorporated entity that is treated as disregarded entity under the federal \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d regulations, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-3 (as it was in effect on January 1, 2020), is treated as Self-Employed and not as a Partner. The Compensation of a Self- employed individual shall be that person\u2019s Taxable Distributions from each separate business reported on Schedules C, E, or F of the Pennsylvania individual income tax Form PA-40, as well as any other non-employee Compensation, which is not otherwise reported on Schedules C, E, or F. Passive Income of a Self-employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax. If the Self-Employed person does not keep records of Taxable Distributions, the entire net income of each separate Business is presumed to be a Taxable Distribution. Any individual who is classified as an Employee, because of the control exercised by the Employer, is not Self- Employed as to any Compensation associated with that particular Business. TAX YEAR \u2013 a twelve-month period from January 1 to December 31. TAXPAYER \u2013 a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity required hereunder to file a return of payroll expense, or to pay a tax thereon. An Employer, Partner, or Self Employed person are a Taxpayer. An Exempt Employer is not a Taxpayer. TEMPORARY SEASONAL OR ITINERANT BUSINESS \u2013 shall mean an Employer whose presence in the City is of a duration of one hundred twenty (120) days or less. TREASURER \u2013 references to the Treasurer in these regulations refer to the Director and/or the Department of Finance. The Director holds principal responsibility for tax administration in the City of Pittsburgh. The Deputy Director of Finance serves as City Treasurer. 7\n\nSECTION 102 \u2013 WHO MUST FILE A RETURN\n\na. The City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258, imposes a Payroll Tax on all persons that engage, hire, employ or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to perform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is computed on the employer\u2019s payroll expense. The Payroll Tax on Partners and Self- Employed is computed based on Taxable Distributions from any Businesses. b. One hundred percent of the payroll expense is attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for Employers whose employees perform work or render services exclusively in the City of Pittsburgh. c. One hundred percent of a Partner\u2019s or Self-employed person\u2019s Taxable Distributions are attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for person(s) who have net income from sales or services rendered exclusively in the City of Pittsburgh. d. For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the percentage of the total number of working hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of working hours employed within and outside of the City of Pittsburgh for each individual employee.

            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century",

The forward\u2019s 1,045 total career assists are four shy of tying Gordie Howe for 10th place on the NHL\u2019s all-time assists list. Crosby is leading the charge for the Penguins with 59 points (18G-41A) on the season. The forward\n\nis just one point away from becoming the ninth player in NHL history to have 17 or more 60-point seasons, and only Washington\u2019s Alex Ovechkin (17) has more 60-point seasons than Crosby among active players. Crosby has historically been successful against the New York Rangers. In 87 career games versus the Rangers, Crosby has registered 40 goals, 68 assists and 108 points. Crosby\u2019s points-per-game average (1.24) against the Rangers is tied for 10th in NHL history (min. 25 GP), and no active player has more points versus New York than him. Crosby is currently the only active player in the NHL with 100-plus points against at least three franchises (New York Islanders, 136; Philadelphia, 133; NY Rangers, 108). Rickard Rakell has been having a career year with the Penguins, leading the team in goals (25) and ranks second in points (49). Rakell enters today\u2019s game just two points away from reaching 500 career NHL points. The forward is looking to become the 12th player from his 2011 draft class to reach 500 points and the third Swede to do it. Rakell, who is on an active six-game point streak (2G-5A) is looking to become the 12th active Swede to reach 500 points. Erik Karlsson is also on a six-game point streak, registering seven points (2G-5A) during this span. His point streak is currently tied for second in the NHL among defensemen. Karlsson leads all Pittsburgh defensemen and ranks fourth on the team with 39 points (6G-33A). The blueliner sits just one point away from surpassing Tomas Sandstrom for sole possession of 10th place on the all-time points list among Swedish players. Only Nicklas Lidstrom (1,142) has more points all-time among Swedish-born defensemen. Philip Tomasino notched his second multi-point outing of the year (2A) yesterday. The winger enters today\u2019s game with four points in his last five games (2G-2A) and only two Penguins have more points than him during February. On February 9, the Penguins claimed defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok (koh-lee-ah-CHOHN-ahk) off of waivers from the Utah Hockey Club. The 23-year-old defenseman is signed through the 2025-26 season and has posted five points (2G-3A) in 23 games this season. The native of Minsk, Belarus was originally a second-round pick (52nd overall) of the Florida Panthers in 2019 and has spent the past four seasons between the NHL and AHL. In 62 career NHL games, he\u2019s recorded 12 points (4G-8A) and one game-winning goal. Kolyachonok also has 150 games at the AHL level split between Tucson and Syracuse, where he\u2019s picked up 48 points (13G-35A) and is plus-12. Quick Hits\n\n1) Tonight, the Penguins conclude their 12th set of back-to-back games. Thus far, the team is 9-14-0 in back-to-backs (3-9-0 on the first night and 6-5-0 on the second night). 2) Philip Tomasino has points in five of his six career games versus the Rangers (4G-1A). 3) Kevin Hayes has three points (1G-2A) over his last four games and has points in back-to-back home games (1G-1A). 4) Anthony Beauvillier has 26 points (13G-13A) in 33 career games against New York. It\u2019s the most goals and points he\u2019s recorded against any one team. 5) The Penguins own an overall record of 399-91-49 when both Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin record a point in a game. Meet the Penguins\n\nAs part of the Penguins Pledge, and in partnership with the National Aviary, Aviary experts and some of their live penguin ambassadors will visit PPG Paints Arena for tonight's game. A permanent display on the FedEx Level of PPG Paints Arena will be home to the visiting penguins and also feature footage of the National Aviary\u2019s Penguin Point habitat for the games when the birds aren't at the arena.

            "2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In 2001, the Steelers moved into Heinz Field . [ 138 ] The franchise dating back to 1933 has had several homes. [ 139 ] For 31 seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh . From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside . The team moved to what was then known as Heinz Field in 2001. In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium. [ 140 ] Training camp Steelers at training camp in Latrobe The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe . [ 141 ] The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: \"... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania , an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland . Classic, wonderful slice of American culture . If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see.\" [ 142 ] The team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside . Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team. [ 143 ] In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season. [ 144 ] Historical facilities The Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s. [ 145 ] In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices. [ 146 ] During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director) [ 147 ] [ 148 ] and suburban Ligonier [ 149 ] also served as a pre-season training camp sites.

            "Policy Provisions Assigning Grades Final grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the semester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie Mellon must be assigned grades. Enrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies of the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the department head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade within one month of Enrollment Service\u2019s query, the department head will be responsible for insuring that a grade is assigned. Changing a Grade A student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade be changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean\u2019s office of the college/school offering the course; for graduate students, department approval is required. The intention of this policy is to insure that, under normal\n\n54\n\ncircumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly advantaged. Mid-Semester Grades Mid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their performance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate are used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in academic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect student performance and are turned in on time. Mid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. Because mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a rule will not be accepted. Incomplete Grades Carnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I (incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has been unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students. In awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the work and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students must complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic semester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the permanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or Enrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade. Pass/Fail Grades Undergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass/fail unless precluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home department/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must submit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they are electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is irreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on to the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be converted to pass/fail. 55\n\nA through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the student's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N on the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N units will not be factored into the student's QPA. In exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or request that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must approve designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will have an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must review the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be made before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. Audit Grades Auditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a letter grade. The extent of a student\u2019s participation must be arranged and approved by the course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the course, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course instructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a course. Any student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. Part-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at the regular per-unit tuition rate. Drop/Withdrawal Grades Students at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or before the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all courses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop\n\n56\n\nvoucher process can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Graduate Education website. Undergraduates who are registered as full-time students as of the 10th day of classes are expected to remain full-time for the duration of the semester. Full-time is defined as registered for a minimum of 36 units. Permission to drop below the 36-unit minimum can only be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the student's home Associate Dean. Undergraduates who are registered as part-time are also subject to the above deadlines to drop or withdraw from a course. Course Repeats When a course is repeated, all grades will be recorded on the official academic transcript and will be calculated in the student\u2019s QPA. This is the case regardless if the first grade for the course is a passing or failing grade. Undergraduate students who wish to repeat a course already passed must obtain approval from the student's Dean or Department Head. When a student takes a course s/he has already passed, only one set of units will count towards graduation requirements. 3. University Grading Standards This grading standard is for all students classified as seeking an undergraduate degree and special students taking undergraduate courses. Special students taking graduate courses will be graded on the graduate grading scale (see below).

Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert\u2019s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts. Before long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator\u2014the \u201cworld\u2019s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot\u201d\u2014was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world\u2019s first university-wide computer network and file system. This growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country.

The rookies toured the facility, which now includes The Market, an onsite pantry where recipients can select their own items and there is no judgement, and all are treated with dignity and respect. The items are all available at no cost and include fresh produce, meats, shelf-stable foods and more. The players also took part in packing produce for distribution, giving them a unique understanding of what is needed to help those who are struggling with food insecurity. Taking care of kids: Tight end Pat Freiermuth has always been passionate about giving back to the Pittsburgh community, loving the ability to interact with others, especially with kids while bringing them joy. That is why he was out and about on his off day, providing school supplies to students at Pittsburgh Mifflin to aid them in the school year. Freiermuth worked hand-in-hand with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources.

            "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]\n\nShannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]\n\nEuropeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000\u00a0acres (800\u00a0km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130\u00a0km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt.",
            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century"

            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association .

        "Question": "Which former steel town was mentioned as having faced significant unemployment due to industrial decline?",
        "<Generated>Answer": "Pittsburgh",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]\n\nGeography of industrialization\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]\n\nA further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]\n\nBy about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]\n\nMachine politics\n\nChristopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]\n\nGermans\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]\n\nLabor unions",

        "Question": "What are the official colors of the Pittsburgh Pirates?",

        "<Retrived>context": [
            "Stargell wearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes . After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. [ 43 ] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys , following the Oakland Athletics . Starting in 1977 , the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series . The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since. [ 43 ] After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009 , the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road. [ 43 ] From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019. [ 49 ] Since the 2015 season , the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games. [ 50 ] The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season , now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches. [ 51 ] Ahead of the 2020 season , the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow. [ 52 ] In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park. In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted \"Y\", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh ( Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio ). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous \"Steelmark\" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh. [ 53 ] Rivalries [ edit ] Philadelphia Phillies [ edit ] Main article: Phillies\u2013Pirates rivalry The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies. [ 57 ] The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969\u20131993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s. [ 56 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span. [ 58 ] After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry. [ 60 ] Cincinnati Reds [ edit ] Main article: Pirates-Reds rivalry The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds , given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry , and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason, [ 61 ] most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game . In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches , occasionally resulting in brawls. [ 62 ] Divisional foes [ edit ] From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series , which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious [ 63 ] battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game . The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of the 1938 season . Interleague [ edit ] The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers . While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League 's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins . The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986\u20131996) and the Tigers (2005\u20132013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36\u201329. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series . An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically. The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule. The Pirates lead the series 21\u201318.

Kamin Science Center , [ 2 ] [ needs update ] is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . It is located in the Chateau [ 3 ] neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium . Overview [ edit ] The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Giant Theater (promoted as \"the biggest screen in Pittsburgh\"), a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University \u2019s Robot Hall of Fame (in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema), [ 5 ] SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and the USS Requin (a World War II submarine ). Updates [ edit ] According to Nicholas Efran, \"The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years.\" However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are \"Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building\" [ 6 ] In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations . [ 7 ] In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 's Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the $10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs. [ 8 ] In June 2022, \u00a7\u00a0Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame , such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars , Maria from Metropolis , as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey , were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the \u00a7\u00a0SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid , the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center\u2019s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage \"until the Science Center decides what to do with it\". [ 5 ] [ 9 ] History [ edit ] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn ) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. [ 10 ] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991. [ 11 ] On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center [ 12 ] Roboworld (until 2022) [ edit ] Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022. [ 9 ] It was touted as \"the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition\", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring \"all things robotic\". [ 13 ] Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid , the Robothespian, an interactive , animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort. [ 14 ] The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2 , C-3PO , Data , the T-800 Terminator , R.O.B. , Maschinenmensch , Gort , Robby the Robot , Robot B-9 , HAL 9000 , and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running . Highmark SportsWorks [ edit ] Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks ) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. [ 15 ] The main idea of SportsWorks is \"to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports.\" [ 15 ] SportsWorks features three themed areas:  Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports). The previous sponsor, UPMC , ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100\u00a0m 2 ) SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark . It reopened in the Fall of 2009. [ 16 ] From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition . At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit. [ 17 ] A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit , then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector , an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh. [ 18 ] E-motion cone [ edit ] The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system. [ 19 ] In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs. [ 20 ] At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] The Roberto Clemente Museum was founded in 2007 [ 1 ] by photographer Duane Rieder. Rieder had met Clemente's family in 1994 during a photo shoot. A decade later, his personal Clemente collection with help from Clemente's immediate family would serve as the basis for the museum. [ 3 ] In 2017, a charity auction featuring over 700 pieces of Roberto Clemente's memorabilia was held. [ 4 ] The roster included his 1960 and 1971 World Series ring. [ 5 ] Charitable causes [ edit ] The Clemente Museum carries on the giving legacy of Roberto Clemente . The museum organized local relief efforts upon hearing of the devastation of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. [ 6 ] They asked the community to donate $21, in honor of Clemente's number, for relief. [ 7 ] The efforts raised over $50,000 and filled two 43-foot tractor-trailers with supplies.

It is in the Allegheny Center neighborhood in Pittsburgh's Northside . History [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh was founded in 1983 in the old Allegheny Post Office , gifted to the museum by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , and is situated on Pittsburgh's North Side, formerly Allegheny City . The neighboring Buhl Planetarium building was vacated by 1991 when it was superseded by the nearby Kamin Science Center . The museum grew from a traveling mobile museum started at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in 1972, and was part of the first wave of children's museums spreading across the country at that time. [ 3 ] New building [ edit ] In the early 2000s, it was announced the museum would be expanding from the old Beaux Arts -style post office into the neighboring vacant Art Deco Buhl Planetarium. A plan was devised by Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc. to connect the two historic structures with a modern glass addition over what was a street called Allegheny Square. The street was vacated and realigned and the addition was built. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh became the largest Silver LEED certified museum in the country in March 2006. This validates that the museum's expansion has been designed and constructed using sustainable practices with particular attention to site development, water conservation, energy management, using recycled materials, waste management, reusing resources, indoor air quality as well as developing new programs for visitors. To offer teaching moments about the new green museum , many of the building's structural and mechanical systems are left exposed. Buhl Community Park [ edit ] In 2010, officials announced plans to rehab a rundown park in front of the museum. The centerpiece of the new park will be a fog sculpture by Ned Kahn . The park opened on June 23, 2012, during a community celebration. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Grounds [ edit ] In its seasonal \"Backyard\", [ 6 ] the museum grounds includes an interactive environment called \"Allegheny Waterworks\" which incorporates preserved local architectural relics. [ 7 ] A garden on the grounds once displayed sculptures of Guyasuta , Christopher Gist and others, designed by sculptor Charles Keck and rescued from the Manchester Bridge when it was razed in 1970. The garden was removed in the 2000s to make room for more parking. The Guyasuta and Gist sculptures have been reinstalled near Stage AE in the North Shore neighborhood. [ 8 ] Exhibits [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh houses several ongoing exhibits as well as rotating exhibits. The MAKESHOP, Kindness Gallery, Studio, Backyard, Garage, Garden, Theater, Waterplay, and Nursery areas are ongoing interactive exhibits and encourage touch and play. [ 9 ] Also located within the museum are iconic items from the show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . These include the original puppets, one of Fred Rogers ' sweaters, and his sneakers. [ 10 ] Programs [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh presents a wide variety of programs for children in fields ranging from dance and rocket building to quilting and robotics. Visiting artists offer workshops in a host of media, including pottery, Japanese paper cutting, animation and painting. The museum's extensive outreach program offers performances, workshops, after school programs, artist days and festival programs for schools and groups throughout the year. Educational field trips are offered for local schools, scouts and other groups. The museum has collaborated with a number of regional institutions and programs, such as the University of Pittsburgh and the Create a Comic Project . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Awards [ edit ] The former Buhl Planetarium building is now part of the Children's Museum The addition has received numerous awards, including a 2009 National Medal for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services , National Trust for Historic Preservation award, LEED silver certification, and an award from American Institute of Architects. Children's Museum Executive Director Jane Werner received the Green Building Alliance [ 13 ] 2006 Shades of Green Leadership Award which celebrates leaders who have helped transform the Pittsburgh region into a more sustainable place to live and work. Werner's contributions cited include launching a new program/initiative supporting green-building related activities; raising significant community awareness and outreach of green issues through materials, programs and events; and influencing the adoption of a program/policy through advocacy efforts and implementing green management and operation policies within the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh.

April 25, 2025. 8 p.m. John Wells Video Studio, Purnell Center for the Arts. Pop culture, conformity and self-actualization Grace was supposed to have a certain kind of life. She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace\u2019s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace\u2019s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife\u2019s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her \u201chappy.\u201d By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

            "Engaging with area youth: The rookies visited the Mel Blount Youth Home in Claysville, Pa., on Thursday, working with the Hall of Fame cornerback to help engage with youth from the surrounding area as a part of his Youth Leadership Initiative. \"With the Youth Leadership Initiative, we're able to work with more kids and have a broader reach,\" said Blount. \"One of the things that we've done is connected with other youth organizations around Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington County, Greene County, Westmoreland County. So, we have a broader reach now. We're able to work and be more effective, reaching more kids. It gives kids, even kids who are not in the system, an opportunity to experience what our program has to offer and help them grow and develop.\"\n\nThe idea behind the visit is to help inspire the kids who are taking part and teach the importance of teamwork as the kids go through a series of physical challenges designed for them to work together in teams. To wrap up community week, the rookies visited the @MelBlountYLI to participate team building activities and football drills with kids. \ud83d\udcdd: https://t.co/atkpy7m9Jg pic.twitter.com/Xv2vPqBuxD\n\nWednesday, June 19\n\nBack to school: The rookies partnered with Jerome Bettis' Bus Stops Here Foundation on Wednesday for projects that are part of the foundation's cyber programs.

The yearly clinic was open to kids from kindergarten through 8 th grade and featured the players teaching drills and encouraging the kids to be active and positive in their school, home and community life. In addition to the football side of it, there were carnival games for kids and their families to participate in and affordable food options through on-site food trucks.

Heyward was joined by many of his Steelers teammates for a fun day of golf that benefits The Heyward House Foundation. The mission of The Heyward House is to impact the lives of today's youth through childhood hunger prevention, promoting literacy, fighting cancer, supporting students and teachers and more. Kicking off camp: Quarterback Russell Willson helped to kick off a summer camp for the Boys & Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania (BGCWPA) through his Why Not You Foundation. The foundation also made a $50,000 donation to the BGCWPA. Wilson and his wife, Grammy Award winning artist Ciara, work together on the Why Not You Foundation, which has a longer-term vision to support communities of Pittsburgh by establishing Why Not You Centers in partnership with leading local nonprofits. Centers will help youth and teens foster \"why not you\" attitudes that allow them to dream and reach for their dreams. Since 2014, Why Not You Foundation has given millions to deserving nonprofits partners in an effort to fight cyclical poverty and drive greater equity for youth in the spaces of education and health. Sunday, June 9\n\nFootball and life lessons: Flag football tournaments have become popular throughout Western Pennsylvania, but over the weekend a special one was held to celebrate Juneteenth, and the Steelers were a part of it. The Steelers took part in the Juneteenth Open Invitation Flag Football Tournament at Mellon Park on Sunday, a two-day tournament that featured teams from all over Pennsylvania. The purpose for the tournament was two-fold, a fun-filled football fest and an avenue to teach kids the history behind Juneteenth. Graham also took part in a CPR training session in conjunction with the American Heart Association and Pittsburgh native and Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin and his Chasing M's Foundation.

The evening was highlighted by a seven-on-seven flag football game, featuring an array of former Steelers players like Jerome Bettis, Ben Roethlisberger and Hines Ward, as well as celebrities such as rapper Fedd the God, actor and comedian Billy Gardell, and actor/musician Chip Esten. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and Hall of Famer and former Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau served as the coaches for the game. The competition was intense, with Polamalu's team coming out on top. \"It's the city that is hosting us tonight in a lot of ways. In that mindset, I am very grateful to be back, to see all of the faces here, to see the team,\" said Polamalu. \"It's nice to be back in the fold in a very meaningful way. We do a lot of charitable work for the community, but to come back here, bring back the alumni, give back to the team.\"\n\nThe event benefits the Neighborhood Resilience Project, an organization the Steelers have a strong bond with. \"Considering the Neighborhood Resilience Project, and the Neighborhood Resilience Institute, and the amazing things they have done, this is great to be a part of,\" said Polamalu. \"The Resilience Project, first and foremost it's a framework that allows the community to heal within. Oftentimes, when people look at trauma, especially the case of trauma in communities, you have a separate figure that is trying to impose certain programs on a community. Some of them are helpful, some not so helpful. The beautiful thing about the Neighborhood Resilience Project is that it's healing from within. It's a framework that allows people that live in the community to talk to people in positions of power, and then they become people of power, and enlighten us to bring healing to the community.\"\n\nThe organization brought hundreds of kids from the Greater Pittsburgh region to enjoy a night where they can see Steelers legends up close. \"This night means so much to them,\" said Rev. Paul T. Abernathy, CEO of Neighborhood Resilience Project. \"For them to have a chance to see some of the Steelers legends, Super Bowl champions, Hall of Famers. It's bringing so much excitement to our youth.",
            "With football being something he loves so much, he normally kicks off his season of giving back with an event focused on the game. In June, Ogunjobi held his 4th Annual Youth Football Camp at his alma mater, Ragsdale High School in North Carolina. The event is free to boys and girls in the community to help young athletes learn the fundamentals of football, with the emphasis on teamwork and sportsmanship. \"I think it's super important to give back,\" said Ogunjobi. \"When you come from a place like this, Ragsdale, that is built on family, faith and football, it just feels right to be around people and give back. Ragsdale has done so much for me. Being able to give back, doing the camp, being around the kids is important and I just love it.\"\n\nOgunjobi hosted a group of young men from the Urban League of Pittsburgh at a practice during training camp, allowing them to enjoy the action from the sidelines and get an up close and personal look of the team's preparation. Following practice, Ogunjobi hosted an etiquette dinner for the young men, giving them an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of fine dining while listening to their stories and sharing insight with them to help better prepare them for life. \"We're really proud of the way Larry has given back and embraced the Pittsburgh community,\" said Coach Mike Tomlin. \"But if you look at it, it's something he's been doing throughout his career whether it's through his youth football camps in North Carolina or his holiday toy drive that started in Cleveland. The veteran leadership and character he brings to this team are big reasons we wanted to do business with him in the first place, and we're happy to have him here and proud of the work he's done.\"\n\nAnd being prepared for life is something he always stresses with the young people he comes in contact with, and a lot of that is based on education and his upbringing. STEM programs are something that are personal to him, something that he studied in college at the University of Charlotte. So, for him to be able to host a NIKE STEM x Shoe event this season and share the importance of programs that are enhanced by advanced technology was extremely meaningful. Ogunjobi partnered with Nike, the Boys and Girls Club of Western PA and the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh's Black Male and Female Leadership Development Programs for the event. \"I just think the trajectory of the world and how technology is moving in such a big way, it's good to get the kids involved,\" said Ogunjobi. \"I think everything we have, everything we do is technologically based. I feel like when you start them early it gives them a chance to work through things. \"It caters to the importance of it all."

        "<Generated>Answer": "Willie Stargell",
        "<Retrived>context": [
            "by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles\u2014the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] \u2014including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633\u00a0winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \" Black Fives \" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920\u201323. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937\u201339 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944\u201345 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947\u201348 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994\u201395 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008\u201309 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009\u201310 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  \u00a7\u00a0Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905\u20131907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception\u2014first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first",
            "first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season . Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960 . They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees , yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente , the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971 . Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass . In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. [ 16 ] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970 , 1971 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 , and 1979 . Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell , Dave Parker , and Al Oliver , the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990. The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , and Doug Drabek . The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992 . Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. Andrew McCutchen , 2012 With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park , did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen , defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game . They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals . That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. [ 17 ] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th [ 18 ] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies , Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs . [ 19 ] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Ballpark [ edit ] Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium , a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. [ 20 ] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services . [ 21 ] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game , when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130. PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; [ 26 ] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, [ 27 ] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente , who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell , Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge , or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station , located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. Former ballparks [ edit ] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park , located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park , which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete"

            "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture\n\nOakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]\n\nNew immigrants and migrants\n\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire.",
            "Contents\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh (/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]\n\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason\u2013Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century"

It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist. [ 4 ] The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol . The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute , the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWFVA). [ 5 ] Warhol Self Portrait Exhibit in 2010 The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot (8,200\u00a0m 2 ) facility on seven floors. Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget (2010) was $6.1 million. In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996. [ 6 ] History [ edit ] Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989, [ 7 ] about 2\u00bd years after Warhol's death. At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated $80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation. [ 7 ] Thomas N. Armstrong III , who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993. [ 8 ] Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work. [ 9 ] By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot (8,200\u00a0m 2 ) industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about $12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over $55 million, [ 8 ] a donation that grew to about 3,000 works. [ 4 ] On May 13\u201314, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend. [ 4 ] Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening; at the time of his resignation, the museum had had \"tense relations\" with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation. [ 4 ] On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum. [ 10 ] In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan , New York City , in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side , an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex. [ 16 ] In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed , based on Warhol's 1975 book, \u201c The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again \u201d, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh. [ 17 ] In 2022, the museum announced a $60 million expansion deemed The 'Pop District' covering six blocks in Pittsburgh, PA. The expansion looks to build a music venue, a social media studio called Warhol Creative, and expand places for public art exhibits. [ 18 ] The proposed site would be around 58,000 square feet (17,500 square meters), including a first-floor concert venue with standing room for up to 1,000 people, a second-floor mezzanine, and an events space that could hold up to 360 people on the fourth floor. The third floor would be used for offices and support spaces. [ 19 ] The project is expected to take ten years and is funded primarily through local foundations. [ 20 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Display of Interview magazine covers The 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event. The film's subject was hosting the event. The Andy Warhol Diaries (TV series) in 2022 prominently featured museum staff as narrators of Warhol's life.
