Guests should wear face coverings upon arrival, while being seated and anytime moving about the restaurant.
Many restaurants are “doubling down” by extending their usual week-long special menus an extra week to make them available to additional patrons this season and still abide by occupancy restrictions.
Due to the current conditions, restaurant menus are not due until August 7.  Thank you for your patience.
