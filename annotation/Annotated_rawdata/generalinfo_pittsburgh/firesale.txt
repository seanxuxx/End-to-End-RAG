LICENSING AND REGULATING “FIRE SALES” 
ACT OF 1963, P.L. 410, No. 217 
 
AN ACT: Regulating and licensing all sales at retail when such sales are advertised as “CLOSING OUT 
SALE”, “FIRE, SMOKE or WATER DAMAGE SALE”, or “DEFUNCT BUSINESS SALE”, with 
exceptions; requiring filing of inventory and bond; and providing for appeals and penalties. 
 
The General Assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows: 
 
SECTION 1. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND – That sales to be licensed and regulated pursuant to the 
provisions of this act have often been conducted and advertised in such a manner as to mislead and 
defraud the public and otherwise to result in harm to the public interest. 
 
That such fraud and imposition on the public has included, by way of partial enumeration only: the 
misrepresentation of the condition or necessity which is the occasion of such sale; the misrepresentation 
of the identity of the person conducting such sale and/or the name and style in which such sale is to be 
conducted; the misrepresentation that the goods offered at such sale are selling at sacrifice prices; the 
misrepresentation that the operator of the sale is selling merchandise on hand at the time when the 
necessity, which is the occasion of such sale, arose, when in fact he is replenishing his stock with 
additional merchandise both prior to the commencement and during the conduct of such sale so as to 
keep foisting upon the public such added merchandise as though it were part of the original stock; and 
the excessive valuation and misrepresentation of the quality, former price and ownership of the goods to 
be sold at such sale; in order to prevent such fraud and imposition, the public interest requires the 
regulation of such sales and the duration and conduct thereof; that the public interest therefor requires 
that no such sale should be conducted without a license or otherwise than in accordance with this act. 
 
SECTION 2. 
UNLAWFUL ADVERTISEMENT – It shall be unlawful for any person in municipalities or 
townships of this Commonwealth to advertise or hold out by any means that the sale of any goods, wares 
or merchandise is a “CLOSING OUT SALE” or a “DEFUNCT BUSINESS SALE” unless a license is first 
obtained to conduct such a sale from the Treasurer of the City or the Secretary of the Borough or the 
Secretary of the Board of Commissioners or Board of Supervisors of the Township in which such sale is 
to be held.
