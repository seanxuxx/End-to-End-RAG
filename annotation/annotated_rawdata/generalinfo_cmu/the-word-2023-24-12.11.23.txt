Carnegie Mellon Code 
 
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated 
to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, 
ethical and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment 
to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place 
the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be 
met, commitments kept. 
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the 
standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is 
rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect 
the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. 
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a 
commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the 
creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. 
Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community 
cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to 
the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that 
respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should 
voluntarily withdraw from the University.

Educational Goals 
Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: 
"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of 
higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional 
education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to 
the community and to the nation." 
More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all 
students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, 
well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, 
research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and 
in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and 
understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the 
university contributes to social progress. 
As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to 
determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited 
areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to 
the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie 
Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially 
for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, 
government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be 
clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by 
all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated 
regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty 
Handbook. 
Academic and Individual Freedom 
Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the 
responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various 
groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the 
responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is 
uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm 
commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity 
of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 

10 
 
 
The commitment to academic and individual freedom carries with it major responsibilities for all 
members of the university. In exercising their own freedoms, they must respect the rights of 
others. In seeking innovation, they must recognize that constructive change can be affected at a 
university only through orderly and rational processes. Intentional acts threatening personal 
safety, malicious destruction of property or willful and substantial disruption of university 
functions have no place in an academic community and will not be tolerated. It is the 
responsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an atmosphere in which 
such violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes which assure the 
protection of these rights for all persons. 
Board of Trustees 
The trustees bear ultimate responsibility for the university, its policies, organization, financing 
and governance. Two direct responsibilities are the supervision of the university's finances 
and the appointment of the president as chief executive officer. The operating 
responsibilities and the authority to act are delegated to the president; and it is primarily 
through the president that the trustees monitor the university's activities. 
Administration 
The administrative officers are formally responsible for supervising the programs and 
enforcing the policies of the university, for assessing the effects of policy and for 
recommending improvements or changes where appropriate. The president is the chief 
executive officer of the university. In the operation of the university, the president delegates 
responsibility to provost, vice presidents, deans, directors and department heads and to 
various councils and committees, which may include faculty, students and staff. 
It is the duty of the administrative officers of the university to maintain a campus climate 
which enhances the freedom of the faculty to teach, to engage in research and to take part in 
other scholarly and artistic activities, and the freedom of the students to learn and grow both 
inside and outside of the classroom. 
Faculty 
The faculty has the primary responsibility for carrying out the educational and scholarly 
programs of the university. 
All members of the faculty have the duty to conduct their courses in a manner consistent 
with the highest standards of their profession. Through the presentation of material in the 

11 
 
 
classroom, they should strive to advance the art of teaching. One of the primary goals should 
be to instill in their students a desire to learn and an enthusiasm for the subject matter at 
hand. The faculty as a whole also has the major responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining curricula which meet the standards and fulfill the educational goals of the 
university.  
Students 
Carnegie Mellon, as a private university, selects from among its applicants those students 
who have demonstrated the qualifications for achieving professional competence in one of 
the fields in which the university offers instruction. Any student who meets its standards is 
welcome to apply for admission and, if admitted, to remain at the university so long as he or 
she abides by its rules. 
Advisory Boards 
Each academic department and school at Carnegie Mellon, as well as some non-academic 
units, has an advisory board whose purpose is to assist the department and the university 
more effectively to carry out their mission.  An advisory board may use any appropriate 
means to achieve this purpose, important among which are evaluating the department's 
goals and directions and providing information and advice to the president, provost, deans 
and department heads. 
Statement on Academic Integrity 
The Statement on Academic Integrity, found in the faculty, student and staff handbooks, is the 
first step in Carnegie Mellon University's ongoing effort to identify and implement the kind of 
society its members wish to enjoy. 
This statement will be followed by implementation strategies as the Task Force on Academic 
Integrity continues its work.  
Please visit the Academic Integrity website for additional information and resources. 
Statement on Academic Integrity 
Carnegie Mellon is a self-governing institution that requires ethical behavior of its 
administration, faculty, staff and students that goes beyond simple compliance with the law. 
Respect for these requirements creates a moral authority for the university to insist upon 

12 
 
 
appropriate behavior. This authority is essential to the accomplishment of the university's 
mission. Integrity as described in this statement is a defining feature of the university 
community's high expectations for the conduct of its members. 
Introduction 
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve 
society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and 
expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the 
changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: 
to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, 
teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership 
and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society 
and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open 
to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. 
These statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the 
Carnegie Mellon community. Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn 
with commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity. This process involves at its core 
interaction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master. Integrity 
requires that we examine the context in which we do our work. In the university community, 
young people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow 
and foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission 
of the university. The university population is increasingly diverse, faces rapid changes in 
knowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate 
roles of individuals and professions in the larger society. Each of these facts can and do 
create issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our 
primary missions. When these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood 
by all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract 
from our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus. When they are openly 
discussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence 
and trust. 
All members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal 
and professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring 
knowledge. This implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that 
prepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them discover and 
maintain integrity in the practice of that role. Staff and administrators are charged with 
representing the university accurately and forthrightly. Students are responsible for 

13 
 
 
conducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion-by avoiding plagiarism, 
cheating or taking credit for work not their own-and thus contributing to a campus 
atmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity. 
Practice of the Mission of Academic Integrity 
Academic integrity refers to the implicit commitment that every member makes to all others 
in the community to practice those principles that underlie the mission of the university and 
define academic integrity. These are: honesty and good faith; clarity in the communication of 
core values; professional conduct of work; mutual trust and respect; and fairness and 
exemplary behavior. 
Honesty and Good Faith 
Underlying all the interactions and transactions of the university is the assumption that all of 
its members act in good faith and are open with each other. For example, students must be 
able to assume that they can take faculty, staff and administration at their word and vice 
versa. If questions about honest communications and good faith arise within the community 
or among some of its members, the general issue must be aired in a frank and open way. 
Individual cases involving alleged infractions, on the other hand, are properly handled under 
conditions that respect confidentiality. Penalties for proven infractions of the university's 
standards must be dealt with promptly and fairly. The more fully we can come to understand 
and concur with one another on guiding principles, the fewer such cases will turn up, and the 
more rewarding the university experience will be for all of us. 
Clarity in the Communication of Core Values 
Clarity in the communication of the core values and standards of Carnegie Mellon requires 
explicit understanding of the mission and core values among members of faculty, staff, 
administration and students; reflection upon and open discussion of standards of practice; 
identification and resolution of conflicts posed by our mission objectives; and a clear and 
open communication of our mission to the community. This means we recognize our 
commitment to the distinct objectives of our vision and mission with all the assessment, 
certification, evaluation and reorientation that these imply. In direct face-to-face situations 
students should be dealt with immediately, openly and honestly. Students also need 
opportunities to learn about and discuss standards, expectations and norms when no 
immediate "case" is at hand. 

14 
 
 
Professional Conduct of Work 
Professionalism for the faculty involves designing syllabi which accurately indicate the subject 
matter and practices of each course and meeting all scheduled classes fully prepared for the 
assigned work. It also involves the certification of students in their areas of expertise. The 
university is obligated to provide measures of student progress in the form of grades, 
degrees, and honors. These attest to society that both faculty and students have fulfilled their 
commitments. Degrees and honors certify that a level of performance has been met in a 
student's demonstration of acquisition and use of knowledge, so it is imperative that grading 
be a fair, accurate and honest measure of a student's work. At the same time, faculty need to 
be cognizant of the pressure on students to view grades, which they see as determining their 
job prospects, as "the be all and end all" of their university experiences and to devise 
strategies in the classroom to make learning, rather than receiving grades, the central focus. 
The ethics governing research must be understood, practiced and communicated to 
students. This involves being clear and truthful about the ownership of research results and 
data, avoiding conflicts of interest (or disclosing them when they cannot be avoided), and 
making only honest and accurate claims in reporting research. In the context of the 
university, the professional conduct of work has two distinct dimensions: professionalism in 
one's discipline or area of expertise and professionalism as a member of the university. The 
distinction between these aspects of professionalism in the academy must be clearly 
understood and communicated. In addition, each of the various academic disciplines and 
fields of endeavor represented at Carnegie Mellon has its own implicit and explicit standards 
for professional work. These are binding on faculty, administration and staff, and must be 
communicated to students as part of their preparation to become professionals. Research 
ethics also entails the open discussion of the propriety of the university's involvement in 
work that seems to be detrimental to society given the values of our mission. 
Professional research in the academy is involved with several of its unique institutional goals, 
including the education of undergraduates, graduate education and certification for 
professional roles, and faculty tenure. These features pose issues specific to the academy, 
issues which must be acknowledged and treated explicitly if we are to be clear, open and 
consistent. The practices of other organizations may therefore not be entirely relevant to 
those in the university. Recognizing that students are learners demands that they be involved 
in ongoing research in ways which benefit their education, rather than merely as assistants in 
faculty projects. Students need also to be clearly informed about standards of behavior and 
performance that are accepted practices in the discipline and held responsible to them. This 
should be done proactively as a learning experience rather than retroactively as a punitive 
experience. 

15 
 
 
Mutual Trust and Respect 
An environment of mutual trust and respect is necessary if the institution is to promote 
integrity. Mutual trust and respect are prerequisites for open communication and honest 
dialogue about values, goals and expectations. They require freedom of expression without 
fear of retribution, institutional or otherwise, and value the diversity of persons, ideas and 
choices differing from one's own. They recognize that being in a diverse community is an 
advantage to encouraging discovery and creativity. Both respect for individuals and respect 
for institutional values involves balancing the claims of personal autonomy with the goals 
and mission of the institution. All of us need to be alert to prevent the power structure of the 
classroom and the university as a whole from suppressing legitimate beliefs and practices. If 
trust should break down, we need to explore the reasons for the breakdown and identify 
ways for the community to rebuild trust among its members. 
A basis for promoting trust and respect is provided by ensuring that the faculty treat the 
student's education and the student as ends rather than as a means to some end. For 
example, the graduate student's development as a researcher and professional, his or her 
learning and well-being, have to be honored as ends in themselves, rather than treating 
graduate student work merely as a means to the end of the production of knowledge (from 
which the professor may benefit more than the student). Students at all levels must be 
encouraged to value their university experience as learning and personal growth, rather than 
solely as the means to a career goal. They are responsible for rendering an atmosphere of 
mistrust by their teachers and among themselves unnecessary by consistently living up to 
the university's standards. 
Fairness and Exemplary Behavior 
The preservation of academic integrity means not only commitment to ideals but also justice 
in carrying out these ideals. Faculty, staff and administration must deal fairly in all of the 
various decisions they make which have consequences for students and all the other 
stakeholders of the university. When questions arise as to whether such decisions distribute 
benefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such 
decisions should be conducted. The power that teachers wield in the classroom must be 
exercised with the greatest possible care for maintaining fairness, which means examining 
classroom practice for any hidden assumptions which might produce confusion or partiality. 
It also means that we describe to students what the expected commitment for a learning 
environment is and how to deal with conflicts of commitment, for example time 
management problems, as they arise. Students must strive to be fair to each other, for 
example in not claiming unjustified credit in carrying out joint projects and in the appropriate 

16 
 
 
sharing of facilities. Staff must demonstrate impartiality in offering students information, 
opportunities and perquisites. 
Integrity in the campus community is more than just swift punishment of plagiarism or 
cheating. It is an on-going process which asks everyone to both consider carefully and 
practice consistently the honesty, clear thinking, professionalism, fairness and trust that 
make learning, teaching and living here rewarding. When misunderstandings or conflicts over 
what constitutes integrity arise, as they may in a changing society, the campus must use the 
opportunity to exercise impartiality and wisdom to adjudicate between ideas and parties. 
Rightly settled, such issues will become the basis for shared understandings in the future. 
The university expects its members to be leaders in matters concerning integrity, not only 
here, but in the larger society we serve.  
Standards for Academic & Creative Life (Academic Policies) 
This section of The Word serves to highlight many policies and procedures related to academics 
at Carnegie Mellon University. You should also become familiar with the following sources, 
which are the primary documents governing academic policies: the University Policies website, 
the Undergraduate Catalog, and individual department handbooks provided to each graduate 
student. 
Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview 
Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the 
University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized 
assistance. 
Academic Integrity Policy  
Students at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest 
standards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their 
shared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency determine 
the integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a 
representation of our university community and of the professional and personal 
communities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment to academic integrity 
is fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education. Honesty and good faith, clarity in the 
communication of core values, professional conduct of work, mutual trust and respect, and 

17 
 
 
fairness and exemplary behavior represent the expectations for ethical behavior for all 
members of the Carnegie Mellon community. 
Policy Statement 
In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his 
own original academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded 
is not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may 
utilize the assistance provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic 
Resource Center (CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any 
other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course 
instructor(s). 
 
In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When 
collaboration or assistance is permitted by the course instructor(s) or when a student 
utilizes the services provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic 
Resource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is 
likewise required. This citation and acknowledgement must be incorporated into the work 
submitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is dishonest and 
is subject to disciplinary action. 
 
Instructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to 
collaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students 
likewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that 
apply in any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the 
student’s responsibility to seek additional information and clarification. 
Policy Violations 
Cheating occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage 
which includes but is not limited to: 
1. 
Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from 
previous course offerings. 
2. 
Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination. 
3. 
Copying from the examination or work of another person or source. 
4. 
Submission or use of falsified data. 
5. 
Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation. 

18 
 
 
6. 
Falsification of academic credentials. 
Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals 
without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another 
source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be 
graded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to: 
1. 
Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased. 
2. 
Graphic elements. 
3. 
Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation. 
4. 
Mathematical proofs. 
5. 
Scientific data. 
6. 
Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another 
person. 
Unauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been 
specifically authorized in this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the 
completion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are 
not limited to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished 
written sources, and electronic sources. Examples of unauthorized assistance include but 
are not limited to: 
1. 
Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy 
statement and the course instructor(s). 
2. 
Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person. 
3. 
Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including 
graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another 
student. 
4. 
Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer 
keys from previous course offerings. 
5. 
Use of unauthorized devices. 
6. 
Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course 
without first obtaining permission from the instructor(s) of the second course. In the 
case of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two 
courses must be obtained from the instructors of both courses. 

19 
 
 
 
Procedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the 
university’s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures, which are published in The WORD 
student handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of 
Student Affairs or her/his designee in consultation with Faculty Senate and the relevant 
student governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are subject to the 
approval of Faculty Senate. Additional guidelines and procedures for graduate students 
may exist at the college/department/program level, in which case they are communicated 
in the college/department/program graduate student handbook. 
Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities 
Qualified individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodations under the guidelines of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Office of Disability 
Resources serves as links between students with disabilities and the campus community.  
Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis. In order to receive 
services/accommodations verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing 
by a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. All information will be 
considered confidential and only released to appropriate personnel on a need to know basis.  
To access services, individuals must initiate a request in writing for specific 
services/accommodations (books on tape, enlargements, interpreters, etc.). The university 
makes available Summary of Accommodations memoranda for students to give to 
professors, which document disability and describe the accommodations. Accommodations 
prescribed only apply to Carnegie Mellon and may not be valid elsewhere. The individual 
takes full responsibility for ongoing assistance. For more information or to initiate a request 
for accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell.

Change of Address 
A student is required to report all changes in address to The HUB by changing his/her 
address through Student Information Online (SIO). It is the student's responsibility to provide 
Enrollment Services and the university with a current address. 
Computing Policy 
Statement 
The purpose of this policy is to set forth guidelines so that members of our community 
may use the campus network and computing facilities in ways that are responsible and 
respectful of privacy. This policy sets forth the university’s expectations of acceptable 
behavior on the part of computer systems users at Carnegie Mellon by providing 
guidelines for appropriate use of computing and related communication systems and 
examples of inappropriate use. These standards of acceptable behavior also extend 
beyond the campus community into the Internet. Just as it is unacceptable to violate 
others’ rights to privacy, property and resources within Carnegie Mellon, it is also 
unacceptable to violate those rights on systems that are not at Carnegie Mellon but are 
accessible through Carnegie Mellon’s connection to the Internet. 
This policy applies to all users of Carnegie Mellon computing systems, including students, 
faculty and staff, and any others granted the use of university computing resources. It 
applies to the use of all computing facilities owned, leased, operated or contracted by 
Carnegie Mellon University. As used in this policy, terms such as “computing,” 
“computing/communications systems,” “computing resources,” etc., refer to all computers, 
communication systems, and peripherals, software, telephones and systems with similar

functions, which are owned by Carnegie Mellon, or which utilize Carnegie Mellon 
infrastructure such as telephone lines or computer networks. 
Although this policy does not attempt to deal specifically with legal issues, university 
members are responsible to act in compliance with the law, including any federal, state 
and local laws governing computer and telecommunications use, as well as all other 
applicable university policies. 
Privileges and Responsibilities 
Every member of the Carnegie Mellon community who uses computing and related 
communications systems at Carnegie Mellon, or systems that belong to Carnegie Mellon 
or which rely on Carnegie Mellon’s infrastructure has the responsibilities described in this 
policy. This includes members of the Carnegie Mellon community who have restricted 
privileges, such as alumni who may have electronic mail access only. Individuals with 
personally-owned computers, but who rely upon the university network to connect those 
computers (either through an on-campus or remote network connection, such as ethernet 
or wireless) are expected to abide by the policies set forth in this document. Personally-
owned computers operating in stand-alone mode or networked through a non-university 
connection are not covered under this policy, but those users are encouraged to consult 
the usage policies set forth by their Internet Service Provider. 
A fundamental premise of this policy is that anyone sharing computing resources with 
other individuals should behave as a reasonable, mature and ethical person. The user 
must recognize that computer systems and networks do not exist in a special 
environment; on the contrary, use of computers is a form of communication, and every 
component of a computing environment and every piece of information it contains belong 
to the university, the university community as a whole, or some individual or group within 
that community. 
Access to Carnegie Mellon’s computing resources is contingent upon being a member of 
the university community and adhering to university and Computing Services policies, 
guidelines and procedures, including this policy. Misuse may result in the loss of access 
and/or university disciplinary action. For some users and certain systems, access may be 
authorized by specific departments, research centers or other organizations affiliated with 
Carnegie Mellon. In such cases, any department- or group-specific policies and guidelines 
must be adhered to when using resources provided by the department or group. This is in 
addition to university policies and Computing Services guidelines and procedures. 
Any user who suspects a violation of the university’s computer use policies, or who has 
knowledge of potential vulnerabilities or security loopholes in a system or network at 

22 
 
 
Carnegie Mellon, should immediately notify the Information Security Office at iso-
ir@andrew.cmu.edu. 
Maintain the Security and Confidentiality of your Account 
Users assume personal responsibility for the use made of their computer accounts. This 
responsibility begins with selecting a secure password, and involves maintaining the 
confidentiality of that password and changing the password regularly in order to assure 
the continued security of your account. For guidance in selecting a secure password, see 
Guidelines for Password Management. If you believe that someone has made 
unauthorized use of your account, you should change your password immediately and 
report the incident to the Information Security Office. 
Respect for Others’ Property and Privacy Rights 
Users are responsible to respect copyright agreements and intellectual property 
ownership. Any material that is the work of another, whether explicitly copyrighted or not, 
should not be distributed by any user without appropriate acknowledgement and/or 
permission of the creator. Unless permission has been granted by the owner of copyright 
protected materials, distribution of copyright protected material via the university 
network or computer systems is prohibited. While the university has been granted 
permission by software vendors to distribute certain software packages via the network, it 
is not generally permissible for individual users to distribute that same software to others 
via the university network or computer systems. See the sections in this policy on Misuse 
and Inappropriate Behavior. While there may be cases in which property rights to 
particular programs, data, etc., are ambiguous or in dispute, the user must assume that 
any information not created by himself or herself belongs to someone else and must 
respect that person’s privacy and property rights to that information. (In certain 
situations, even information created by the user may not belong to that user but rather to 
the university or others.) This policy is not intended to limit “fair use” as permitted under 
the Copyright Act and users having questions about whether a particular use constitutes a 
“fair use” may consult the Office of the General Counsel for advice. 
Improper/Illegal Communications  
Any communications that would be improper or illegal on any other medium are equally 
so on the computer: libelous material, obscene messages, harassment, forgery, threats, 
etc. However, this is not intended to restrict the free expression of ideas. Communication 
conducted in accordance with the university policy on Freedom of Expression and with 
the statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment 
and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University will not be considered a violation of this 

23 
 
 
policy. For further guidelines, see also the university policy on Separation of Individual’s 
and Institution’s Interests. 
Responsible Sharing of Resources  
Where a resource such as memory, CPU time or access to network resources belongs to 
the whole community collectively, it must be shared. 
It is unacceptable to make such excessive use of system or network resources that other 
users cannot obtain access. Examples include excessive use of CPU time during a period 
of heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that does 
not limit such utilization, the use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an 
environment of networked computers, and any activity that makes a system unusable or 
significantly degrades performance for others. A novice user might be unaware that a 
particular action constitutes “excessive use” but, without doubt, once a system 
administrator makes him or her aware of the fact that such an action is unreasonable, 
that user will be held responsible for any further such infractions. If you are unsure 
whether your needs constitute excessive use, contact the system administrator. Similarly, 
if you need an unusual amount of disk space, CPU time or other resources, check with the 
system administrator to find out whether this use can be accommodated, rather than risk 
interfering with the work of others on the system. 
Risks of Data Loss and Data Persistence  
Although the university will make efforts to secure the network and university controlled 
servers from abuse and damage, it cannot guarantee against data loss by a student, 
faculty, member or staff, either on a university-operated or an individually-owned 
computer. 
 
Users should know that even those files that they have “deleted” using the appropriate 
procedures in the application or operating system, may indeed be recoverable if they exist 
in a system backup file or other persistent form. If the university is asked to recover such 
data by subpoena, it must cooperate, and data that the user believes to have been 
destroyed may be recovered in the process. 
Personal Use  
While the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of 
education and research, and for administrative activities, it realizes the need to encourage 
the personal use of computing for the convenience of the campus community. Thus, it is 
reasonable to allow the use of computing resources for computer mail, document 

24 
 
 
preparation, personal or course Web page publication, or other activity that can facilitate 
convenience or enhance productivity, to the extent that the activity is within the limits 
described by Responsible Sharing of Resources. Any personal use of computing resources 
related to operating a personal business or commercial enterprise is prohibited unless 
permission to do so has been specifically granted by the provost or the provost’s 
designee. 
We do recognize the difficulty of distinguishing whether certain cases of “personal use” 
are allowable, such as activities that result in personal financial gain (e.g. checking stock 
prices online), relate to a commercial business (e.g. university-sponsored technology 
transfer efforts), or support (but do not constitute operating) a personal business (e.g. a 
student developing a business plan or a faculty member writing a report for a consulting 
engagement outside the university). In such cases, we rely on individuals to be 
responsible and judicious in the use of university’s shared computing resources. In 
particular ensuring: 
• appropriate use of resources (e.g. any such work is completed outside of university 
time and does not utilize shared resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth 
to a degree that adversely impacts academic or research activities); 
• appropriate use of licenses (e.g. do not use software procured with academic use 
licenses for commercial applications or development, unless the license explicitly 
permits such use); 
• appropriate marketing (e.g. no creation of “.com” domains within Carnegie Mellon’s 
“edu” domain, no advertising services and products using Carnegie Mellon email 
accounts, and no advertising using web pages on Carnegie Mellon servers (any server 
with a .CMU.EDU host name). 
In cases of questionable personal use of resources, you may contact it-
help@andrew.cmu.edu to determine whether a particular activity is permissible. 
We reserve the right to restrict personal use of university systems and networks by an 
individual or by the community at large, if the use of resources for such activities becomes 
excessive.  If you need unlimited access to computer networks for private or business 
purposes, you can subscribe to a commercial service. 
For information regarding the use of resources to produce intellectual property and profit 
from the development of such property see Carnegie Mellon University’s Intellectual 
Property Policy and the Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment. 

25 
 
 
Privacy 
The user must presume that the contents of any other users’ directory are private unless 
expressly designated otherwise, just as one would presume that the contents of 
someone’s apartment or office are private. The only exceptions to this rule are: that in 
some environments, files such as “plan files” may be considered public even if the user 
has not expressly designated them as such; and that some services such as web pages 
and anonymous or “guest access” ftp services may be considered to be public, but only for 
those areas not protected by password and which are “obviously” public. An unprotected 
account or shared device (such as a shared disk on a networked computer) are not 
considered to be public unless the name or service expressly indicates that it is. In such 
cases, any files or other data which would appear to be private in nature, by virtue of the 
file name or data stored, even if “publicly accessible” should be considered to be private. 
The user accessing such files has a responsibility to ask the owner of the files or service if 
the files are intended to be publicly accessible before the user does more than a “cursory 
glance” sufficient to cause the question. 
A user can explicitly grant access to his or her directories, files or to services run from his 
or her systems. However, users who issue general or vague invitations to browse through 
their files incur a special obligation to protect any material that they do not wish others to 
see. Indeed, all users are urged to maintain protection levels on their files consistent with 
the access they are actually willing to give to other users. 
Access to Faculty Data  
Electronic data on a faculty member’s account, whether stored on a computer in the 
faculty member’s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that faculty 
member, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without 
the faculty member’s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid 
subpoena, search warrant, or order of a court. Posting of data by a faculty member on 
servers available to the public or to students shall be understood to imply consent, and 
electronic access given to specific parties by the faculty member will likewise imply 
consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for 
example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the faculty 
member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity 
in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other 
aspects of the university’s computing infrastructure. 
Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an 
“emergency.” Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job 

26 
 
 
position/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost 
or by a designate of the Provost. 
Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the faculty 
member whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to 
compliance therewith, and, whenever possible and legally permissible, sufficient time 
must be allowed, before intrusion, to allow the faculty member to file a motion to quash. 
Information obtained from an examination warranted by an emergency cannot be used 
as evidence in university sanctions of any faculty member, and cannot be released to the 
public, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are 
essential to resolution of the emergency, or constitute evidence of a crime concealment of 
which would obstruct justice, and in the latter case release may only be to appropriate law 
enforcement officials. Any intrusion by an employee of the university into a faculty 
member’s electronic data must be reported to the faculty member as soon as possible, 
and within five days of the event in writing both to the faculty member, if possible, and 
unless prohibited by order of court, and to an Ombudsman, who shall be a member of 
the regular faculty selected annually by the Nominating Committee of the Faculty Senate 
and who has been endorsed by majority vote of the Faculty Senate. The Ombudsman 
shall be a current or retired regular faculty member who holds no administrative 
appointment and is not a member of the Faculty Review Committee. The Ombudsman 
shall have authority to investigate whether an intrusion was warranted by the policy and, 
(i) shall inform the President and the affected faculty member of the Ombudsman’s 
findings; (ii) where a violation of the policy is found, shall inform the Faculty Review 
Committee of the policy violation; and (iii) where appropriate, in the absence of the 
affected faculty member, to bring a grievance before the Faculty Review Committee. 
Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. 
For purposes of this section, the term “faculty” shall mean any person who is a member of 
the Faculty Organization as defined in Article III of the Constitution of the Faculty 
Organization. 
Access to Staff Data         
Electronic data on a staff member’s account, whether stored on a computer in the staff 
member’s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that staff member, may 
not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the staff 
member’s consent, except in cases of emergency, in response to a valid subpoena, search 
warrant, order of a court, or by specific request by the staff members’ supervisor for the 
purpose of accessing work-related electronic data. Posting of data by a staff member on 
servers available to the public or to members of the university shall be understood to 

27 
 
 
imply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the staff member will 
likewise imply consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may 
include, for example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the 
staff member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious 
activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or 
other aspects of the university’s computing infrastructure. 
Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an 
“emergency.”  Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by 
job position/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by 
Provost or by a designate of the Provost. 
Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the staff member 
whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to 
compliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an 
emergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public 
officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or 
constitute evidence of a crime concealment of which would obstruct justice, and in the 
latter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any such 
findings may be reported to the staff member’s supervisor, department head, or to 
Human Resources for appropriate investigation and action. Any intrusion by an employee 
of the university into a staff member’s electronic data must be reported to the staff 
member as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via electronic mail unless 
prohibited by order of court, or due to a continuance of an ongoing investigation by the 
University. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. 
When possible, staff members will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or 
other intrusions into their electronic data. In cases where a staff member believes that 
electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed by another staff 
member, the incident should be reported to Human Resources. 
Access to Student Data 
Electronic data stored in a student account, whether stored on a computer in the 
student’s residence or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that student, may not 
be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the student’s 
consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, 
order of a court, or by order of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. Posting of data 
by a student on servers available to the public shall be understood to imply consent, and 
electronic access given to specific parties by the student will likewise imply consent for 

28 
 
 
those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are 
not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the student, or the search for and 
examination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers 
the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university’s 
computing infrastructure. 
Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an 
“emergency”. Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job 
position/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost 
or by a designate of the Provost. 
Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the student 
whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to 
compliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an 
emergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public 
officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or 
constitute evidence of a crime of concealment which would obstruct justice, and in the 
latter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any findings of 
potential wrongdoing unrelated to the original intent of the search, must be reported to 
the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for appropriate investigation and action. Any 
intrusion by an employee of the University into a student’s electronic data must be 
reported to the student as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via 
electronic mail to the student, if possible, unless prohibited by an order of the court or 
because of an ongoing investigation conducted by the University. Violation of any aspect 
of this policy is a sanctionable offense. 
When possible, students will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or other 
intrusions into their electronic data, including the purpose of the search. In cases where a 
student believes that electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed 
by a staff member, the incident should be reported to Office of the Dean of Student 
Affairs. 
Note: Removable media such as floppy disks, zip drives, tapes, or CDs in a faculty or staff 
office, or in a residence hall are not subject to search by Computing Services, though 
Computing Services will assist authorized law enforcement agencies or authorities to read 
data after they are obtained, at the agencies’ or authorities’ request. 

29 
 
 
Protecting Confidential Information 
Users who maintain confidential information, such as records relating to employees or 
students, are responsible for following privacy-related policies, laws, and data use 
agreements. 
Protecting Personal Information  
As is described throughout this policy, data transmitted across the university network or 
stored on university systems may be accessed by others as a result of misuse by an 
individual, as an incidental result of the routine operation of the network and systems, or 
in response to a court subpoena or university investigation into suspected or alleged 
misuse. While complete privacy of personal data may not be possible, users who wish to 
ensure a higher degree of privacy for their data are encouraged to use encryption, PGP 
security, or other techniques to reduce the risk that others may access their data.  
Misuse and Inappropriate Behavior 
The following activities are expressly prohibited at Carnegie Mellon: 
• Using a computer system without proper authorization granted through the university, 
college, or department management structure. Some activities such as “port scanning” 
are not expressly prohibited. However, if the target of such scanning requests that an 
individual or system stop performing such actions, the person or system performing 
the scans must stop scanning the target machine unless the scans are being carried 
out by a system administrator who has the authority and responsibility over the 
machine(s) being scanned or for the network being used. 
• Concealing your identity, or assuming the identity of another (e.g., by sending forged 
electronic mail). Note that some forms of electronic communication, such as browsing 
Web pages, passively “identify” users. Keeping your identity private either by not 
setting an identity in your browser or by using a Web-anonymizer in order to protect 
yourself from being put onto mailing lists is not a violation of this policy. 
• Sharing your password or account with the specific exception of staff or faculty 
members allowing their administrative support personnel to access their accounts in 
order to provide services appropriate to their job functions. Note that some policies 
for the accessing of specific systems or data (see PCI-DSS Guidelines) explicitly forbid 
the sharing of passwords used to access them, and that such restrictions for those 
specific systems override this policy. 

30 
 
 
• Using another person’s computer account, userID, files, or data without appropriate 
permission, as described in the previous bullet (e.g. using an account found “logged in” 
on a cluster machine). 
• Deleting or tampering with another user’s files or with information stored by another 
user on any information-bearing medium (disk, tape, memory, etc.). Even if the user’s 
files are unprotected, with the exception of files obviously intended for public reading, 
such as Web pages, it is improper for another user to read them unless the owner has 
given permission (e.g. in an announcement in class or on a computer bulletin board). 
• Attempting to “crack” or guess other users’ passwords. System administrators or those 
specifically designated by the administrator or owner of a system may attempt to crack 
passwords in order to test and enhance the security of the system. In cases where an 
individual or department “owns” machines which use password files controlled by 
another organization (e.g. Andrew machines or their like), the owner may not attempt 
to crack passwords without explicit permission by the owners of the password 
database. 
• Obtaining passwords by other means, such as password capturing and key logging 
programs. 
• Attempting to circumvent system security (e.g. breaking into a system or using 
programs to obtain “root” access), without the explicit permission of the owner of that 
system. 
• Denying appropriate access to resources to other users (e.g. “ping flooding” another 
system, sending “mail bombs,” or modifying a login file in order to cause a user to not 
be able to log in). 
• Releasing programs such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, etc., that disrupt other 
users, damage software or hardware, disrupt network performance, or replicate 
themselves for malicious purpose. 
• Sending commercial solicitations via electronic mail (i.e. spamming) to individuals, or to 
newsgroups or mailing lists where such advertising is not part of the purpose of the 
group or list. (It is permissible to send a commercial solicitation to a “for sale” 
newsgroup, provided that the advertisement conforms to other policies and guidelines 
at Carnegie Mellon.) 
• Any “mass mailing” which is solicitous in nature, unless the mailing is in the conduct of 
university business. 

31 
 
 
• Reselling of services based on the university network, such as web hosting, mailing 
services or the selling of shell accounts. 
• Running a proxy server which results in inappropriate or unauthorized access to 
university materials to non-university members. 
• Advertising commercial businesses or ventures on Web pages hosted by Carnegie 
Mellon, unless prior authorization has been granted. 
• Using mail messages to harass or intimidate another person (such as by repeatedly 
sending unwanted mail or broadcasting unsolicited mail). 
• Violations of any local, state or federal laws, such as the distribution of copyright-
protected materials (e.g. the distribution of commercial software, music or films in 
electronic format without appropriate permissions by the owner, even if the user 
distributing the materials notifies others of their copyright status). 
• Tampering with, willful destruction of or theft of any computer equipment, whether it 
belongs to the university or to an individual. Tampering includes any deliberate effort 
to degrade or halt a system, to tie up a system or to compromise the system/network 
performance. Willful destruction includes any deliberate disabling or damaging of 
computer systems, peripheral equipment such as scanners or printers, or other 
facilities or equipment including the network, and any deliberate destruction or 
impairment of software or other users’ files or data. 
• The unauthorized removal of university or another's computing equipment, which 
constitutes theft. 
This list should not be considered to be complete or exhaustive. It should, however, serve 
as a set of examples of obviously inappropriate behaviors. If you are in doubt about the 
appropriateness of something that you want to do, contact the Computing Services Help 
Center at 412-268-HELP, or send mail to it-help@andrew.cmu.edu and ask first. 
Enforcement 
Inappropriate behavior in the use of computers is punishable under the general university 
policies and regulations regarding faculty, students and staff. The offenses mentioned in 
this policy range from relatively minor to extremely serious, though even a minor offense 
may be treated severely if it is repeated or malicious. Certain offenses may also be subject 
to prosecution under federal, state or local laws. 
Appropriate disciplinary action depends not only on the nature of the offense, but also on 
the intent and previous history of the offender. The range of possible penalties includes 

32 
 
 
reprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary 
probation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. 
Offenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very 
informal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal 
procedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human 
Resources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the 
Faculty Review Committee for faculty. 
Restrictions of Privileges During Investigations 
During the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may 
be necessary to temporarily suspend a user’s network or computing privileges, but only 
after determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a 
risk to the university or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these 
cases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges 
is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a 
computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will 
be rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to 
prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the 
misuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or 
network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity 
occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was “attacked” by a 
Carnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient 
data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an 
attack. 
Adverse Impact on Shared Systems                            
The university reserves the right to discontinue communication with external systems that 
are known to harbor spammers, account crackers, or phishing sites, despite the fact that 
this may restrict certain acceptable communications. When deemed necessary, this action 
will be taken to protect the security and safety of our systems. Similarly, there may be 
cases where a particular service or activity on a given university system will, by the very 
nature of its legitimate operation, tend to generate attacks from other Internet sites. If 
these attacks are frequent and severe enough to cause service interruptions for larger 
parts of the campus community, it may be necessary to temporarily or permanently 
remove these systems from the campus network. In cases where such an action is 
deemed necessary, network administrators will work with the maintainers of the system 
to identify alternative methods of network access. In cases where the university restricts 

33 
 
 
access to external sites or removes network access for internal sites, the purpose of the 
action is to maintain the security and reliability of the computer systems and networks 
rather than to punish an individual or a site, or to restrict the free expression of ideas. 
Conduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) 
Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs 
the class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard 
to tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the responsibility of the individual 
instructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if 
major action, such as dropping the student from the course, is being considered. 
All classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all 
holidays and recesses. Both faculty and students are expected to be present. 
Members of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from 
classes to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of 
town, provided the following conditions are met: 
• All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; 
• No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are 
not scheduled; 
• The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization 
annually; 
• Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student 
affairs staff member. 
Technology affords many students access to portable devices including cell phones, PDAs, 
and laptops. It is expected that students will respect the wishes of faculty with regard to the 
use of electronic devices within the academic environment. 
Students who, because of religious beliefs, cannot attend class may arrange as individuals to 
be absent, provided the work missed is made up in a manner satisfactory to the instructor(s) 
of the class(es) missed. 
No student shall leave a scheduled exercise because of the absence of the instructor until a 
reasonable time has passed. By tradition and as a matter of courtesy a student should wait 
10 minutes before leaving.

Cross-College and University Registration PCHE (Pittsburgh Council on 
Higher Education) Guidelines Policy 
Statement 
Cross-registration provides opportunities for enriched educational programs by 
permitting full-time paying undergraduate and graduate students to cross-register for one 
course at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie 
Mellon degree students are eligible. The PCHE course may not count towards full-time 
status unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. There is no additional 
tuition charge, except for special course or laboratory fees. Carnegie Mellon students do 
not acquire status at the host institution, but are given library and bookstore privileges. 
Credit and grades are transferred directly to the home institution. Cross-registration is not 
applicable during the Summer Session(s) or during intersessions. 
There are nine approved PCHE Institutions in the Pittsburgh area: 
Carlow University (412-578-6084), Chatham College (412-365-1121), CCAC (412-237-2555), 
Duquesne University (412-396-6230), LaRoche College (412-367-9300), Pittsburgh 
Theological Seminary (412-362-5610), Point Park University (412-392-3861), Robert Morris 
College (412-262-8256), University of Pittsburgh (412-624-1544) 
1. 
Each college or university accepts registration from the other institutions; however, 
first priority is given to students of the host institution, and not all departments or 
schools in all institutions are able to participate in this program. 
2. 
In each case of a student cross-registration, the approval of the dean or a designated 
individual from the home college or university must be obtained prior to registration. 
3. 
In addition, the student's advisor or dean is responsible for assuring the student's 
eligibility for the course in which he/she intends to enroll. 
4. 
Full credit and grades for cross-registered courses will be transferred to the 
appropriate institution; the academic regulations of the host university will prevail. 
5. 
The academic honesty code and other rules of conduct of the institution providing 
instruction apply with respect to its courses and behavior on its campus. That 
institution also determines whether its rules have or have not been violated. The 
student's own institution will impose such penalties as it considers proper when 
violations are reported to it. 

35 
 
 
6. 
Cross-registrants do not thereby acquire the status of students in the institutions in 
which they are receiving instruction (e.g., for purposes of participation in student 
activities, insurance programs, etc.). They do receive library privileges at the host 
institution and may purchase course texts at the host bookstore. 
7. 
Each qualified student normally may enroll in no more than one course off campus in 
any one term or semester under this program. Students wishing to cross-register for 
more than one course in a term must have approval from the appropriate academic 
offices at both schools. 
8. 
No additional tuition charge is made to students who are participating in this 
program; however, the student who cross-registers is responsible for paying any 
course or laboratory fees to the host. 
9. 
Cross-registration does not apply to summer sessions at any of the institutions. 
10. Adding or dropping a course after the home institution's deadline date requires 
permission from the home institution; adding or dropping a course after the host 
institution's deadline date requires permission from the host institution. 
11. Students enrolled in approved joint co-op programs between two PCHE institutions 
are exempt from the requirement of being full-time at either school in order to cross 
register. Students are bound by the requirements of that program. 
12. Carnegie Mellon students may not cross-register for required courses that are 
normally available at Carnegie Mellon. Exceptions may be made if courses are 
unavailable or legitimate schedule conflicts seriously hinder completion of degree 
requirements within the prescribed timeframe. 
13. "PCHE Cross-Registration Request" forms are available from The HUB. 
Doctoral Student Status Policy 
Policy Statement 
The university has a policy that covers: time limits on doctoral student status, a definition 
of All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence and In Absentia status for doctoral 
students and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In 
Absentia. 

36 
 
 
These rules apply to all doctoral students. Students who began their doctoral studies prior 
to the date of this policy’s revision may follow time-to-degree requirements from the 
previous policy, but all other rules set forth in this policy will apply immediately to all 
doctoral students. 
Time to Degree 
Students will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten 
years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more 
restrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the 
person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently 
offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, 
family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the 
relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer 
the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of 
that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for 
all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their 
program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 
All But Dissertation Status 
All But Dissertation, ABD, status is intended for students whose only remaining 
requirements are the completion and defense of their dissertation. Once a student meets 
the departmental criteria [1], All But Dissertation status must be approved by the 
department by submitting the appropriate form to CMURegistrar@andrew.cmu.edu. 
In Residence Versus In Absentia 
Once students achieve All But Dissertation status, they must choose whether to complete 
their dissertation In Residence or In Absentia. A doctoral student In Residence maintains 
student status and all consequent student privileges and continues to be actively engaged 
with the university. A doctoral student In Absentia status is one who has left the university 
with the intent of completing their dissertation but is not actively engaged with the 
university and does not require university resources. When a student decides whether to 
pursue All But Dissertation In Residence or In Absentia, they must complete a Doctoral 
Student Status Agreement form, which is available through their academic department or 
on the HUB website. Once the agreement has been approved by the student’s 
 
1 General examples of having met All But Dissertation requirements may include completing all courses and passing qualifying 
exams; completing all courses and acceptance of dissertation proposal; etc. as defined by program, department or school. 

37 
 
 
department, the student may change their status between In Residence and In Absentia 
multiple times with approval. A student In Residence or In Absentia must meet the specific 
criteria noted later in this policy. 
Students In Absentia will not be verified by the university as an enrolled "student" for 
immigration or loan purposes. All But Dissertation students in J1 or F1 immigration status 
must continue to follow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations [2]. 
All But Dissertation Students In Residence 
All But Dissertation students In Residence receiving any financial support (such as tuition, 
stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral 
to their doctoral program that is  paid by or administered by the university must be 
enrolled for at least thirty-six units to maintain full time student status and all subsequent 
student privileges. Exceptions to the thirty-six unit enrollment requirement may be 
granted by the Provost [3]. 
All But Dissertation students In Residence who are not receiving any financial support 
(such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), from the 
university tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program should consult their 
college policy to determine the number of units for which they must be registered in 
order to maintain full-time student status and all subsequent privileges. 
All But Dissertation students In Residence who are pursuing their doctoral degree on a part 
time basis and are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or 
health insurance, whether full or partial), from the university tied to activities that are 
integral to their doctoral program should consult their college policy to determine the 
number of units they must be registered for in order to maintain part time student status 
and all subsequent privileges. Note that doctoral students must be a full time graduate 
student for at least one academic year or more if required by the student’s home college. 
All But Dissertation students who are employed by the university in a capacity 
independent of their educational program and are pursuing a doctoral degree part time, 
may register for the number of units required by their department in order to remain in 
part time status so long as they are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, 
stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral 
 
2 The intent of the DHS regulations is that the student continues to pursue completion of the degree on a full-time basis under 
the jurisdiction of the university that will award the degree. International students who enter All But Dissertation status must 
remain In Residence and be registered full-time as defined in this policy to preserve F1 or J1 immigration status while they 
complete their degree. Questions about All But Dissertation status and immigration requirements should be addressed to the 
Office of International Education. 
3 If granted exception results in the student’s enrollment being reduced to less than half time, tax consequences may apply. 

38 
 
 
to their doctoral program by their college, school or department. Questions about 
eligibility for tuition benefits should be referred to the Benefits Department. 
Final Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence 
Students who are supported by the university must be registered for thirty-six units for 
the entirety of their final semester and will be assessed their college’s full-time tuition. 
FULL-TIME STUDENTS 
If a student completes all Ph.D. degree requirements and is certified by: 
• September 30th (in the fall), or February 28th (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted 
to $0; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the semester. 
• October 31st (in the fall), or March 31st (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted to 50% 
of the full-time tuition; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the 
semester. 
• After October 31st (in the fall), or after March 31st (in the spring), but BEFORE the 
first day of the next semester, tuition will not be adjusted and they will remain 
enrolled for thirty-six units for the semester. 
• Fees will not be adjusted after the semester course add deadline. 
• Tuition will not be assessed in the summer, except for students who return from All 
But Dissertation In Absentia status and who are registered for thirty-six units. For 
those students who are certified by June 15th tuition will be adjusted to $0; for those 
who are certified by July 15th tuition will be adjusted to 50% of the full-time tuition. 
For those who are certified after July 15th but BEFORE the first day of the next 
semester, tuition will not be adjusted, and they will remain enrolled for thirty-six 
units for the semester. 
PART-TIME STUDENTS 
Students registered for fewer than thirty-six units are not eligible for a tuition 
adjustment, regardless of their certification date. Fees will not be adjusted. 
All But Dissertation Students In Absentia 
An All But Dissertation doctoral student may, upon departmental approval, be regarded 
as In Absentia when, and so long as, the following three conditions apply: 
• The student has been enrolled as a full-time graduate student at Carnegie Mellon 
University for at least one academic year or more if required by the student's home 

39 
 
 
college. Part-time graduate enrollment may, at the department's discretion, be 
counted pro-rata toward this requirement. 
• The student does not receive any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or 
health insurance) tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program that is 
paid by or administered by the university. 
• The student does not require substantial use of university resources. Departmental 
approval of this condition shall be subject to guidelines established by the school or 
college. 
According to university guidelines, students In Absentia may [4]: 
• Use University Libraries. 
• Use the university stores. 
• Use computing facilities only for department communications and for dissertation text 
preparation. 
• Enter university buildings for faculty/student consultations. 
• Be eligible for student health insurance as determined on a case by case basis [5]. 
• Use the Career and Professional Development Center. 
• Become university employees. 
May not: 
• Be employed with a graduate student stipend [6]. 
• Maintain legal F1 or J1 student status. 
• Use University Health Services [5]. 
• Buy parking permits [7]. 
• Use athletic facilities [7]. 
 
4 An All But Dissertation student In Absentia may be hired as an university employee without switching to active student status 
so long as the hiring department certifies that the student is not hired at Carnegie Mellon for work directly related to his/her 
dissertation and that the student does not inappropriately make substantial use of resources for work towards the doctorate as 
noted above.  As an employee, an individual would be eligible for benefits that apply to his/her status as an employee, not as a 
graduate student. 
5 University Health Services is not available to students in In Absentia status, except in an emergency, or on a case by case basis. 
All inquiries may be directed to the Manager of Business Operations, University Health Services. 
6 Graduate students are not considered employees of the university as their primary affiliation with the university is as a student. 
7 An individual whose primary relationship with the university is as an employee and who as Ph.D. student moves to the status of 
ABD In Absentia will be eligible for benefits that apply to his/her status as an employee. 

40 
 
 
• Reside in university housing. 
Employment of All But Dissertation Students In Absentia 
As noted above, All But Dissertation students In Absentia are extended only minimum 
access to university resources. The student does not receive any financial support (such as 
tuition, stipend, fees, or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are 
integral to their doctoral program paid by or administered by the university. An All But 
Dissertation student In Absentia cannot be hired for work by Carnegie Mellon University 
directly related to completing their dissertation and/or make substantial use of resources 
for work toward the doctorate as noted above [4]. In order to be in compliance with these 
policies, the university's employment policies and the Internal Revenue Service, an All But 
Dissertation student In Absentia may only be hired for university employment through the 
appropriate employment process. Questions should be referred to Human Resources. 
Tuition and Fee Effects of In Absentia Student Status Including the Final Semester 
While an All But Dissertation student is In Absentia, no tuition will be assessed. The student 
will, however, be responsible for all applicable fees.  
An All But Dissertation student who is In Absentia, who returns to defend their dissertation 
has several options: 
1. 
A student who receives support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, 
whether full or partial) paid for or administered by the university, must follow the 
policy for Final Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence (see 
above) and is eligible for the tuition to be pro-rated as identified in the schedule. 
2. 
A student who is not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or 
health insurance, whether full or partial), paid for or administered by the university 
and is returning to the university must change from In Absentia to In Residence and 
shall be assessed for a minimum of five units of graduate study based on their 
current school/college’s tuition before the degree is certified. The tuition rate will not 
be adjusted based on certification date. 
a. A student returns to the university solely for the purpose of the defense and is In 
Residence for 10 or fewer days would pay the technology fee in addition to the 
tuition. 
b. A student returns to the university solely for the purpose of the defense and is In 
Residence for more than 10 days would pay the technology, transportation, and 
student activities fee in addition to the tuition. 

41 
 
 
3. 
A student who is In Absentia may petition their program to complete and defend their 
dissertation without a return to campus. Such a student will be not be charged 
tuition but would be charged a Dissertation Completion Fee and technology fee. 
Evaluation and Certification of English Fluency for Instructors Policy 
Summary of How the Carnegie Mellon Policy Satisfies the Pennsylvania English 
Fluency in Higher Education Act 
• The Pennsylvania English Fluency in Higher Education Act requires the University to file 
annually with the Pennsylvania Department of Education a certification stating that its 
instructional personnel are fluent in the English language. All instructional personnel, 
both native and nonnative speakers of English who teach undergraduate students, 
must be included in CMU's annual certification process. 
• Faculty members who are native speakers of English and who teach undergraduates 
will be certified by their departments on the basis of conversations with the dean, 
department head or specified designee. Departments cannot assume that someone is 
a native speaker without talking with him or her. 
• The fluency of non-native English speaking faculty members will be evaluated through 
two interviews: one with the dean, department head or specified designee, and the 
second with a senior faculty member. All interviewers must be native speakers of 
English. 
• TA English fluency — both graduate and undergraduate — is managed through the 
International Teaching Assistant testing process administered by CMU's Intercultural 
Communication Center. 
(Note: CMU policy requires the International Teaching Assistant Test for TAs of both 
graduate as well as undergraduate classes.) 
• Consistent with Pennsylvania law, CMU allows for the following exemptions from 
certification: 1) visiting faculty, 2) faculty who will teach courses taught predominantly 
in a foreign language, 3) faculty who do not teach undergraduate students, and 4) 
faculty who work one-on-one with students. 
(Note: CMU requires TAs to take the ITA for any job that requires student interaction.) 

42 
 
 
Examinations for Undergraduate Courses Policy 
Preamble 
The Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of examinations 
for the undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). 
These policies represent an understanding between faculty and student concerning an 
important but often stressful period, especially at the conclusion of each academic 
semester and at mid-semester. There should be no expectation that the following points 
will cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the 
exam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize 
that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations 
during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably 
consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the 
student well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course 
syllabus. 
In order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this 
document lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. 
Instructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the 
course syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the 
responsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with 
the instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed. 
Definitions 
• Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on 
the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the 
last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). 
• Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by 
the University Registrar's Office. 
• Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the 
final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; 
such exams are called self-scheduled examinations. 
• Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all 
course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. 
• In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as 
in-term examinations. 

43 
 
 
Policies 
I. In-term Examinations 
1. 
All in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. 
However, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may 
be administered outside of regularly scheduled class time. 
2. 
No examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled 
examinations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time 
Saturday or Sunday. 
3. 
The instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls 
outside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an 
alternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, 
including those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that 
the instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner). 
4. 
No student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class 
examinations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the 
instructor in a timely manner of his/her circumstance so that appropriate 
accommodations can be made. 
II. Final Examinations 
1. 
All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the 
university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are 
not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or 
instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never 
be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self-
scheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or 
final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in 
courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. 
2. 
Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day 
of classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not 
possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided 
unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been 
returned. 

44 
 
 
3. 
No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final 
examination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final 
examination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no 
classes other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. 
Review sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort 
should be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the 
time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio 
reviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a 
final examination. 
4. 
Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that 
people can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading 
day or weekend preceding examinations. 
5. 
No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start 
within a 25-hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled 
within a 25-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should 
first contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the 
problem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate 
dean of his or her home college. 
6. 
Take-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the student's 
choosing during the final examination period. 
7. 
Students are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the 
examination; late arrival will reduce the total time a student has to complete the 
examination, unless instructor's course policy indicates otherwise. Instructors 
reserve the right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who 
miss an examination with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make-up 
final examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to 
include late arrival policy and make-up exam policy in the course syllabus. 
8. 
Any student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final 
examination in the presence of an instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy 
arising from this review shall be dealt with in accordance with the university 
procedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination that is 
not returned to a student will be kept available for a year for review. In the event that 
the instructor or teaching assistant is not available for the review, the responsibility 

45 
 
 
shall rest with the department head of the instructor offering the course or his or her 
designee. Since instructors are expected to return all work assigned before the final 
examinations, they are not responsible for retaining unclaimed coursework. 
9. 
Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final 
examination policy or alterations of the final examination schedule should be 
directed to the department head of the instructor offering the course or to the 
associate dean of the student's home college. 
Fair Use Policy 
Policy Statement 
Members of the university community often find it necessary to make scholarly use of 
materials copyrighted by third-parties.  The Copyright Act contains many exceptions and 
limitations that permit the use of a work without the permission of the copyright owner, 
most notably fair use. 
1. 
It is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University that all members of the University 
community must comply with U.S. Copyright Law, in particular the Copyright Act of 
1976, 17 U.S.C § 1, et seq. 
2. 
Copyrighted works may be used freely by the copyright owner.  Works in the public 
domain (generally, material published before 1923) may be used freely by everyone. 
3. 
Faculty, students, and staff members of Carnegie Mellon University may use 
copyrighted materials of other parties provided such activities are allowed by license 
or by a specific exception in copyright law including but not limited to: 
• 17 U.S.C. § 108 - library uses; 
• 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) - the first sale doctrine; 
• 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) - the right to display copies; 
• 17 U.S.C. § 110(1) - performance and display in classrooms; 
• 17 U.S.C. § 110(2) - distance education; and 
• 17 U.S.C. § 121 - reproduction and distribution of copies in specialized formats for 
the print disabled. 

46 
 
 
4. 
When a proposed use is not permitted by license and does not fall within one of the 
specific exceptions, it may still be permitted under the fair use doctrine, codified at 
17 U.S.C. § 107.  Appendix A to this policy contains guidance to assist university 
community members in determining whether a use qualifies as a fair use. 
5. 
When a proposed use of copyright material does not fall within the fair use doctrine 
and is not otherwise permitted by license or exception, written permission from the 
copyright owner is required to engage in use. 
Appendix A: Guidance on Fair Use Standards 
Background 
The ability to reuse pre-existing copyrighted materials is central to the mission of the 
University in the 21st Century.  A faculty member might wish to include a quotation in a 
book or distribute an article to her students through a course website.  A student might 
want to create a multimedia project incorporating images, film clips, and music samples 
for a class assignment.  A librarian may seek to digitally preserve archival material.  The 
Copyright Act contains many exceptions and limitations that permit the use of a work 
without the permission of the copyright owner, most notably fair use. Although these 
exceptions have always been important to the academic enterprise, the digital revolution 
enables a wide range of new uses that significantly enhance the educational and scholarly 
process, thereby increasing the reliance on these exceptions generally, and fair use in 
particular. 
According to the Supreme Court, the objectives of the fair use doctrine are to preserve 
free speech and to promote creativity. Codified in the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. § 
107, the preamble to the fair use doctrine lists six favored purposes: criticism, comment, 
teaching, scholarship, and research. For this reason, the Supreme Court has recognized 
that "the fair use defense affords considerable latitude for scholarship and comment." 
After the preamble, Section 107 sets forth four non-exclusive factors courts must consider 
in determining whether a use is fair. Courts have broadened their interpretation of the 
four factors significantly over time. Recent interpretations have favored educational uses 
involving new technologies. 
When conducting a fair use analysis, members of the University community should 
consider (1) the fair use factors and (2) applicable codes of best practices.  The following 

47 
 
 
guidance is designed to assist members of the University community in conducting a 
proper fair use analysis. [8] 
1. The Fair Use Factors 
Members of the University community are required by Section 107 to consider and 
balance the following factors to determine if a use qualifies as a fair use. The factors 
should not be balanced mechanically, but weighed together "in light of the purposes of 
copyright." The ultimate test of fair use "is whether copyright's goal of promoting the 
Progress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by 
preventing it." 
A. The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial 
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes. 
• Courts have favored nonprofit education uses, including making multiple copies for 
classroom use, and "transformative" uses where the new use does not supersede the 
originally intended use. 
• The repurposing or re-contextualization of a work can be transformative, even if the 
work itself is not modified. 
• Digitization of works to provide access to the print disabled, to enable indexing, and 
to enable "non-consumptive research" (e.g. text mining) has been considered 
transformative. 
B. Nature of the copyrighted work. 
• Courts have favored uses of factual works, as opposed to fiction, and uses of 
published works as opposed to unpublished works. 
• If a use is transformative, the nature of the work is less important. 
C. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a 
whole. 
• Minimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair 
use analysis. 
• The extent of permissible copying under fair use varies with the purpose and 
character of the use. 
 
8 This guidance contains citations to some more recent court decisions.  For the sake of brevity not all legal principles in this 
guidance contain citations.  Please contact the Office of the General Counsel if you have any questions regarding this guidance. 

48 
 
 
• Copying an entire work may be permissible if necessary to achieve a legitimate 
purpose. For example, the copying of entire works did not weight against fair use 
when necessary for the purpose of providing access to the print disabled or 
providing a search index to complete works. 
• Copying of a quantitatively small portion of a work can weigh against fair use if the 
portion used is "the heart" of the work. 
• The inclusion of one chapter of a book in electronic course reserves did not weigh 
against fair use even when the publisher made available licenses for digital excerpts. 
D. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 
• Although in the past this factor was considered to be the most important in the fair 
use analysis, this no longer is true. 
• Courts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work. 
• With respect to impact on potential licensing revenue, courts look at "traditional, 
reasonable, or likely to be developed markets." 
• Markets for transformative uses are not traditional markets; hence, a transformative 
use does not impair the market for purposes of this factor. 
• Even when a court concluded a use was non-transformative, it considered the 
adverse impact on a licensing market only if the license was easily accessible, 
reasonably priced, and available for the portion and format the user sought to use. 
E. Good Faith of User 
• Some courts have identified a fifth, non-statutory factor: whether the user acted in 
good faith. 
• This factor should typically weigh in favor of nonprofit educational uses. 
• Documentation of the user's fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a 
statement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user's good faith. 
Although copyright law generally does not require a user to attribute the source of 
material, such attribution demonstrates the user's good faith. (Attribution often also is 
required as a matter of academic ethics as well as the terms of a Creative Commons 
license.) 
In addition, courts have treated as fair use: 

49 
 
 
• Copying incidental to the streaming of films assigned for courses [9]; 
• Inclusion of chapters of monographs (but not textbooks) in electronic course reserves [10]; 
and 
• Mass digitization of books for the purpose of preservation, creating a search index, and 
providing access to the print disabled. [11] 
When considering similar uses, members of the University community should treat these 
decisions as important guideposts. 
2. Best Practices 
Several educational communities have developed codes of best practices in fair use.[12] 
These codes each represent a community's consensus about acceptable practices for the 
fair use of copyrighted materials.  Legal scholarship has demonstrated that courts give 
weight to what a relevant community considers to be acceptable practice.  When 
exercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and 
follow the appropriate code of best practices. 
In particular, the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (see 
link below) articulates a set of principles for how fair use applies to certain common 
practices in the university setting. The Code sets forth limitations that should be observed 
to assure that the case for fair use is strong, and enhancements that could further 
strengthen that case. These principles include that it is fair use to: 
• Make appropriately tailored course-related content available to enrolled students via 
digital networks; 
• Make digital copies for purposes of preservation, and to make these copies available 
as surrogates for fragile and inaccessible materials; 
• Create digital versions of a library's special collections and to make these versions 
electronically accessible in appropriate contexts;

http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/fair-use/code-of-best-practices#.W7JRcWhKhPY); see also American University 
Center for Social Media, Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Open Course Ware; Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy 
Education; Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication; and Society for Cinema and Media Studies' 
Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use in Teaching for Film and Media Educators (available at http://www.cmsimpact.org).

• Reproduce materials in accessible formats for disabled students when fully accessible 
copies are not readily available for commercial sources; 
• Receive material for an institutional repository, and to make deposited works publicly 
available; 
• Develop digital databases to enable non-consumptive analysis for scholarly and 
reference purposes, including search; and 
• Create collections of websites and other material from the Internet and to make them 
available for scholarly use. 
The enhancements often involve the use of technological measures to restrict access to 
the appropriate set of users, and to prevent unnecessarily broad dissemination.  Like the 
judicial determinations of fair use, this Code of Best Practices should inform the fair use 
calculus performed by members of the University community.[13] 
Although the judicial decisions and the Codes of Best Practices are instructive, members of 
the University must consider the application of the fair use doctrine to the unique facts of 
the proposed used. 
Final Examinations for Graduate Courses 
There is no university policy on the administration of final examinations for the graduate 
courses. Students should consult their department or college handbooks for applicable 
policies. Concerns related to final examinations for graduate courses may be directed to the 
course instructor, the department head of the instructor offering the course, or to the 
graduate associate dean (or equivalent) of the student’s home college. 
For information pertaining to final examinations for undergraduate students, please review 
the Examinations for Undergraduate Students Policy. 
Financial Aid Policy 
Statement 
University Academic Scholarship Renewals 
Carnegie Mellon University awards academic scholarships as part of the freshman 
financial aid process. Each of these scholarships is renewable for four academic years of 
 
13 As noted above, other fair use Codes of Best Practices may be relevant as well. 

51 
 
 
study (five for architecture) based upon the maintenance of a specific cumulative quality 
point average. The academic scholarship renewal criteria are included in the scholarship 
notification letter which is mailed to the student prior to the May 1 matriculation deadline. 
Each scholarship recipient's cumulative quality point average is reviewed at the end of 
each academic year. If the student achieves the scholarship renewal criteria, then the 
scholarship is automatically renewed for the next academic year. 
If the student does not meet the cumulative quality point average requirement for 
renewal, then s/he is given the opportunity to appeal. A merit scholarship appeal form 
and instructions are automatically sent to the student at the end of each academic year. 
The student's completed appeal form is reviewed by members of the Enrollment Services 
staff. Input from the Associate Dean of the student's college is also considered. The 
student is notified, in writing, of the decision. The decision may be to renew the 
scholarship for the entire academic year, renew the scholarship for one academic term, or 
to reject the appeal. If the appeal is rejected, a written explanation is provided to the 
student. 
Undergraduate Tuition Exchange Programs 
Carnegie Mellon University assesses the standard tuition charge for the undergraduate 
tuition exchange programs. 
Since Carnegie Mellon assesses the tuition charge, the student can be considered for all 
forms of institutional, state, and federal aid for which the student may have eligibility with 
the exception of any student employment program. 
Undergraduate Study Abroad Programs 
Carnegie Mellon University does not assess the tuition charge for any of the Study Abroad 
Programs. 
Since Carnegie Mellon does not assess the tuition charge, the student is not considered 
for any institutional grants and scholarships. However, Carnegie Mellon will consider any 
student participating in an approved Study Abroad Program for all state and federal 
student aid programs for which the student may have eligibility with the exception of any 
student employment program. 
The U.S. Department of Education and Carnegie Mellon University define an approved 
Study Abroad Program as one which is part of a contractual agreement between Carnegie 
Mellon and the host institution. Additionally, courses taken in the Study Abroad Program 
must be accepted for transfer to Carnegie Mellon by the Dean of the student's college. 

52 
 
 
Undergraduate International Students 
For purposes of undergraduate student financial aid, an International Student is defined 
as someone who is neither a U.S. citizen nor an eligible noncitizen. The U.S. Department 
of Education defines an eligible noncitizen as: 
1. An individual who is a permanent resident of the United States (as evidenced by an I-
151 or I-551 card); or 
2. An individual who can provide documentation from the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) that s/he is in the United States for other than a temporary 
purpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident of the United 
States. 
An undergraduate, International Student is ineligible to receive any federal or state 
student financial aid. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon does not award any institutional 
financial aid funds to undergraduate International Students. 
Financial Obligations 
Students should pay the amounts due on their E-Bill by the due date on their invoice. Past 
due accounts are subject to a 1.5% penalty charge each month until the balance is paid in 
full.   
All financial obligations to the university need to be met or future enrollment and other 
services may be affected. These obligations include, but are not limited to, tuition, fees, room 
and board, student health insurance, library or parking fines, or any other charges due to the 
university. 
Grading Policies 
Policy Statement 
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking 
courses, whether those students are undergraduates, non-degree students or graduate 
students. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning and Changing Grades (including 
Final and Mid-Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options 
(Audit and Pass/Fail), Drop/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate 
and graduate Grading Standards. 

53 
 
 
Questions about grading for a specific course should be addressed to the instructor of the 
course in question. Graduate students with questions about Pass/Fail and 
Drop/Withdrawal should contact their individual programs. 
Appeals for an exception to any grading policy may be made by the dean's office of the 
student’s home college. 
1. Definitions 
Certain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. 
• Student means any full-time or part-time degree-seeking undergraduate or graduate 
student, or full-time or part-time non-degree student. 
• Non-degree student means a student that is not in a university degree program. 
• Faculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the 
Faculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first 
year), and part-time faculty. 
• Instructor means a faculty member, teaching assistant, and /or lecturer who is the 
instructor of record, as recorded in the Student Information System (SIS). 
2. Policy Provisions 
Assigning Grades 
Final grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the 
semester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie 
Mellon must be assigned grades. 
Enrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies 
of the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the 
department head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade 
within one month of Enrollment Service’s query, the department head will be responsible 
for insuring that a grade is assigned. 
Changing a Grade 
A student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade 
be changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with 
the approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean’s 
office of the college/school offering the course; for graduate students, department 
approval is required. The intention of this policy is to insure that, under normal 

54 
 
 
circumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly 
advantaged. 
Mid-Semester Grades 
Mid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their 
performance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate 
are used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in 
academic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect 
student performance and are turned in on time. 
Mid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. 
Because mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a 
rule will not be accepted. 
Incomplete Grades 
Carnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic 
semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I 
(incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has 
been unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of 
passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student 
over other students. 
In awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the 
work and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students 
must complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic 
semester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the 
permanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or 
Enrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade. 
Pass/Fail Grades 
Undergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass/fail unless 
precluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home 
department/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised 
to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must 
submit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they 
are electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is 
irreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on 
to the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be 
converted to pass/fail. 

55 
 
 
A through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the 
student's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N 
on the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N 
units will not be factored into the student's QPA. 
In exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or 
request that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must 
approve designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will 
have an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must 
review the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be 
made before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. 
Audit Grades 
Auditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a 
letter grade. The extent of a student’s participation must be arranged and approved by 
the course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the 
course, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course 
instructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a 
course. 
Any student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. 
Part-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at 
the regular per-unit tuition rate. 
Drop/Withdrawal Grades 
Students at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or 
before the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all 
courses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary 
and students should be advised to check with their individual 
colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course 
is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped 
by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. 
After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line 
registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After 
the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's 
academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. 
Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the 
deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through 
consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop 

56 
 
 
voucher process can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Graduate Education 
website.  
Undergraduates who are registered as full-time students as of the 10th day of classes are 
expected to remain full-time for the duration of the semester. Full-time is defined as 
registered for a minimum of 36 units. Permission to drop below the 36-unit minimum can 
only be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the student's home Associate Dean. 
Undergraduates who are registered as part-time are also subject to the above deadlines 
to drop or withdraw from a course. 
Course Repeats 
When a course is repeated, all grades will be recorded on the official academic transcript 
and will be calculated in the student’s QPA. This is the case regardless if the first grade for 
the course is a passing or failing grade. 
Undergraduate students who wish to repeat a course already passed must obtain 
approval from the student's Dean or Department Head. When a student takes a course 
s/he has already passed, only one set of units will count towards graduation 
requirements. 
3. University Grading Standards 
This grading standard is for all students classified as seeking an undergraduate degree 
and special students taking undergraduate courses. Special students taking graduate 
courses will be graded on the graduate grading scale (see below).

Students who entered Carnegie Mellon (as graduate students) prior to Fall 1995 follow 
their previous graduate grading standard. Graduate students who take a leave of absence 
and return to Carnegie Mellon will do so under the 4.33-point grading scale. These 
students will have their past semester QPAs recalculated at the time of their return. 
No A+ may be given in an H&SS or CIT course. No D or D+ may be given in a Tepper 
course. Pass/Fail policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to 
check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. Only Tepper and 
MCS record W grades. 
Department and college policy determine minimum passing grades in graduate courses. 
Any course that a graduate student completes will be graded using this scale. This 
includes undergraduate courses taken by graduate students, and special students taking 
graduate courses. 
Handling Alleged Misconduct In Research Policy 
Statement 
Carnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the 
university. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the 
university must establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of 
research with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the 
allegations, and the university. Furthermore, federal regulations require the university to 
have explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of 
misconduct in research. 
Introduction 
This document outlines the procedures to be followed when misconduct in research is 
alleged at Carnegie Mellon. As defined by the National Science Foundation: [14] 
"Misconduct means (1) fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious deviation 
from accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from research; (2) 
material failure to comply with Federal requirements for the protection of researchers, 
human subjects, or the public or for ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals; or (3) 
failure to meet other material legal requirements governing research." 
 
14 National Science Foundation. 45 CFR Part 689. "Misconduct in Science and Engineering Research," Federal Register. Vol. 52. No. 
126. Wednesday, July 1, 1987, p. 24468. 

59 
 
 
To be deemed misconduct for the purposes of this policy, a "material failure to comply 
with Federal requirements" or a "failure to meet other material legal requirements" must 
be intentional or grossly negligent. 
In conjunction with the procedures outlined in this policy, the provost is responsible for 
complying with applicable federal regulations, including notifying sponsoring agencies at 
the appropriate time[15] and keeping those involved, Committees of Inquiry and 
Committees of Investigation, well informed with respect to the requirements of these 
agencies. If at any time it appears that the possibility exists that the alleged misconduct 
might involve a violation of any federal, state or local criminal statute, the university 
attorney must be consulted immediately to determine further action. 
Allegations 
Questions about, or suspicions of, misconduct in research should be brought to the 
attention of the provost for confidential counseling and possible informal resolution. 
Allegations of misconduct shall be presented to the provost in writing. Anonymous 
reports will not be accepted. The provost will acknowledge allegations in writing to the 
claimant. [16] 
After a review of the allegation, the provost must decide within 15 days whether a 
Committee of Inquiry is needed and, if so, establish such a committee promptly. The 
claimant must be informed, in writing, of the provost's decision. 
If a decision is made to establish a Committee of Inquiry, the respondent[17] must be 
informed in writing of the allegation, advised of the initiation of the inquiry process, and 
asked to provide information. 
Committee of Inquiry 
The provost shall appoint a three-member Committee of Inquiry. Committee members 
should be faculty or staff who, in the judgment of the provost, have the appropriate 
seniority and knowledge to assess the alleged misconduct and do not have a conflict of 
interest that would interfere with an objective review. 
 
15 Currently, NSF requires notification when it is decided that a formal investigation will be undertaken; however, it should be 
borne in mind that guidelines in many agencies are currently under development, so it would be impossible to incorporate such 
guidelines in this policy. 
16 "Claimant" and "respondent" are the terms used by the Association of American Universities in their draft document, 
Framework for Institutional Policies and Procedures for Fraud in Research, August, 1988. We have chosen to use these terms in this 
document. The terms "claimant" and "respondent" in this policy stand for singular or plural, as the case may require, unless 
qualified as "individual claimant" or "individual respondent," respectively. 

60 
 
 
The provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Inquiry to conduct a discreet inquiry 
based on communication with the respondent and the claimant. The purpose of the 
inquiry is to determine if there is reason to believe that misconduct has occurred. The 
inquiry should be limited to activities necessary to determine whether to recommend a 
formal investigation. 
The identities of the respondent and claimant will be kept confidential by members of the 
committee, if possible. 
If a majority of the members of the committee of Inquiry recommend that a formal 
investigation be conducted, the provost must establish a Committee of Investigation. If 
only a minority of the members of the Committee of Inquiry recommend a formal 
investigation, the provost may either dismiss the allegation or establish a Committee of 
Investigation. 
If the Committee of Inquiry determines that the allegations have been made in a 
capricious or malicious manner, they will report this to the provost for appropriate action. 
The Committee of Inquiry has 30 days to conduct the inquiry. If the inquiry cannot be 
reasonably completed within 30 days, the Committee may request a 30-day extension 
from the provost. 
If a decision is made to establish a Committee of Investigation, the respondent must be 
informed of the identity of the claimant, shown all of the documents and evidence that 
relate to the charges, and given 15 days to respond prior to initiating the investigation. 
Sponsoring agencies shall be informed if appropriate or mandated. 
Committee of Investigation 
The Committee of Investigation shall have five members, none of whom was a member of 
the Committee of Inquiry. The provost will appoint two members. The chairmen of the 
University Research Council, the Faculty Review Committee, and the faculty will each 
appoint one member. 
The provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Investigation to conduct a thorough 
investigation of the allegation. The committee should have access to all persons and 
information needed to determine the extent to which misconduct has occurred. 
Otherwise, the investigation should be as confidential as possible. 
The Committee of Investigation shall prepare a written report documenting the extent to 
which misconduct has occurred. This report will be given to the provost, the respondent, 
the claimant, the chairman of the University Research Council, the chairman of the Faculty 

61 
 
 
Review Committee, the chairman of the faculty, the university ombudsman, and the 
president and, if any involved individual is a student, to the dean of Student Affairs. 
Optionally, the Committee of Investigation may recommend to the provost a course of 
action based on their findings.  
The Committee of Investigation has 120 days to complete the investigation. If the 
investigation cannot be reasonably completed within 120 days, the committee may 
request a 30-day extension from the provost. 
Determination of Action and Appeal 
The provost will transmit to the president of the university the reports of the Committee 
of Inquiry and the Committee of Investigation together with his recommendation for 
appropriate action. 
When the provost's recommendation to the president calls for no action to be taken 
against an individual respondent and the president concurs, as well as when the president 
declines to accept a recommendation for action, the president shall, at that respondent's 
request, in writing, address to that respondent a letter identifying the allegations 
investigated and stating the reasons for the provost's recommendation and/or the 
president's decision, as appropriate. This letter shall be available for responsible use at 
the addressee's discretion. It shall not be included in the personnel file unless such 
inclusion is requested, in writing, by the addressee. The president's letter must be 
formulated, and used by the recipient, so as to preserve the confidentiality of the process, 
and shall in particular include only information already disclosed to the addressee. 
For each individual respondent found responsible for misconduct, the president may 
impose (or request, in the case of a regular, research, or special faculty member) specific 
sanctions, including termination of employment for a faculty or staff member and 
expulsion of a student. 
The imposition of sanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal 
prescribed by the Appointment and Tenure Policy for a regular, research, or special 
faculty member; the Staff Grievance Procedure for a staff member (or the provisions of a 
written labor agreement for an employee in a bargaining unit); and the provisions of the 
section on Discipline in the Student Handbook for a student. 
Following completion of the Committee of Investigation's work and the provost's 
recommendation, when an individual respondent is a faculty member, if the president 
decides to initiate against that faculty member the procedure for dismissal for cause or 
for the imposition of another sanction, the procedure is then subject to the Exceptions 

62 
 
 
provision of the subsection Procedures of the section entitled Dismissal for Cause and 
Other Sanctions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy, thus precluding the Ad-Hoc 
Committee stage. 
The provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this section are also applicable to 
appropriate action regarding each individual claimant found responsible for allegations 
made in a capricious or malicious manner. 
Human Subjects in Research Policy 
Policy Statement 
The university is committed to the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects 
in research investigations conducted under the jurisdiction of the university. The 
university believes that review independent of the investigator is necessary to safeguard 
the rights and welfare of human subjects of research investigations. All research involving 
human subjects is conducted in accordance with federal regulations, including Title 45 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 (45 CFR 46). Under federal regulations, human 
subjects are defined as: living individual(s) about whom an investigator conducting 
research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) 
identifiable private information. 
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is established under the provost to ensure adequate 
safeguards. The provost is responsible for the composition of the IRB with respect to: (1) 
the qualifications of IRB members in terms of educational background and research or 
other relevant experience, and (2) broad representation of relevant university interests. 
This IRB is responsible for reviewing investigational procedures involving human subjects 
prior to the initiation of the research procedure in reference to (1) the rights and welfare 
of the individuals involved, (2) the appropriateness of the methods used to obtain 
informed consent, and (3) the risks and potential benefits of the investigations. The IRB is 
responsible for determining when additional expertise is required for adequate review 
and for obtaining that additional expertise. The IRB is further responsible for maintaining 
records of its review activities and decisions and for ensuring that records of informed 
consent are developed and kept by investigators where appropriate. 
It is the responsibility of investigators who plan to use human subjects in research to 
obtain written consent from the IRB prior to conducting an investigation involving human 
subjects. It is the investigator's further responsibility to take whatever steps are 

63 
 
 
determined necessary for the protection of the subjects, and to meet the reporting 
requirements established by the IRB. 
Intellectual Property Policy 
1.  Purpose 
The policy reflects the following goals: 
• To create a university environment that encourages the generation of new knowledge 
by faculty, staff, and students. 
• To facilitate wide transfer of useful inventions and writings to society. 
• To motivate the development and dissemination of intellectual property by providing 
appropriate financial rewards to creators and the university, and administrative 
assistance to creators. 
• To ensure that the financial return from the development of intellectual property does 
not distort decisions and operations of the university in a manner contrary to the 
mission of the university. 
The policy is based upon the following principles relating the university to society: 
• The mission of the university remains the generation and dissemination of knowledge. 
• Intellectual property will be generated within the university, and there exists an 
obligation to disseminate it. An interface is needed if better technology transfer is to 
be achieved, and the university will provide mechanisms for that function.[17] 
The policy is based upon the following principles relating faculty, staff and students to the 
university. 
• Intellectual property is created by individuals, or by groups of individuals, who are 
entitled to choose the course of disclosure; academic freedom of individuals is a 
higher priority than possible financial rewards. 
• There exists an historical tradition allowing authors to retain ownership of intellectual 
property rights from textbooks and works of art. 
 
17 This document presumes the existence of a university office to facilitate technology transfer. Such an office would serve as a 
clearinghouse for contacts with outside partners, would perform patent and copyright tasks, and would develop an effective 
marketing capability. 

64 
 
 
• The university is the support of the whole campus community, and is thereby entitled 
to share in financial rewards. 
• There should be incentives for all parties to pursue financial rewards together, 
consistent with the expressed goals of the policy. The distribution of these rewards 
should reflect, insofar as possible, the creative contributions of the creator, and the 
resources contributed by and risks assumed by both the creator and the university in 
developing intellectual property. 
• Since it is frequently difficult to meaningfully assess risks, resources and potential 
rewards, negotiated agreements are to be encouraged whenever possible. 
2.  Definitions 
Certain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. 
These definitions do not necessarily conform to customary usage. 
• Intellectual Property includes any patentable invention, any copyrightable subject 
matter, or trade secret. It also includes works of art, and inventions or creations that 
might normally be developed on a proprietary basis. 
• University means Carnegie Mellon. 
• Student means any full-time or part-time graduate or undergraduate student, 
regardless of whether the student receives financial aid from the university or from 
outside sources. It is the responsibility of students who are also employees of other 
outside entities to resolve any conflicts between this policy and provisions of 
agreements with their employers prior to beginning any undertaking at the university 
that will involve the development of intellectual property. 
• Faculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the 
Faculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first 
year), and part-time faculty. 
• Staff means any employee of the university other than students and faculty as defined 
above. If a student is also a part-time university employee, he is considered as staff 
with regard to intellectual property developed as a result of his employment, and as a 
student with regard to other intellectual property. A full-time non-faculty employee 
who is also taking one or more courses is considered to be staff. Visitors to the 
university who make substantial use of university resources are considered as staff 
with respect to any intellectual property arising from such use. (The distinction 
between faculty and staff does not affect intellectual property rights except for 
representation on the Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee [see Section 5]). 

65 
 
 
• Creator means any person or persons who create an item of intellectual property. 
• Net proceeds to the university means all proceeds received by the university on 
intellectual property that it assigns, sells or licenses, minus any application, litigation, 
interference, or marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being 
licensed. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; 
the sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. 
• Net proceeds to the creator means all proceeds received by the creator from 
intellectual property owned by him that he sells, assigns or licenses, less the costs of 
application, legal protection, or litigation, interference, travel and other marketing 
costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being exploited. Such net 
proceeds do not include compensation legitimately received by the creator for 
consulting services or interest or other return on invested labor or capital. Deducted 
costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; the sources and 
amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. 
• Substantial use of university facilities means extensive unreimbursed use of major 
university laboratory, studio or computational facilities, or human resources. The use 
of these facilities must be important to the creation of the intellectual property; merely 
incidental use of a facility does not constitute substantial use, nor does extensive use 
of a facility commonly available to all faculty or professional staff (such as libraries and 
offices), nor does extensive use of a specialized facility for routine tasks. Use will be 
considered "extensive" and facilities will be considered "major" if similar use of similar 
facilities would cost the creator more than $5000 (five thousand dollars) in constant 
1984 dollars if purchased or leased in the public market. Creators wishing to directly 
reimburse the University for the use of its facilities must make arrangements to do so 
before the level of facilities usage for a particular intellectual property becomes 
substantial. (This provision is not intended to override any other department or 
university policy concerning reimbursement for facilities usage.) 
In General: 
In any given year the equivalent figure for a particular amount of money in constant 1984 
dollars will be obtained by multiplying that amount of money by the ratio of the most 
recent quarterly Disposable Personal Income Deflator divided by the average monthly 
Disposable Personal Income Deflator for the year 1984. 
As used in this policy, the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, singular or 
plural, wherever appropriate. 

66 
 
 
3.  Policy Provisions 
This section states the policies concerning ownership of intellectual property created at 
the university. In order of precedence, ownership of intellectual property shall be as 
follows: 
3-1. Externally Sponsored Work 
Ownership Provisions: Intellectual property created as a result of work conducted under 
an agreement between an external sponsor and the university that specifies the 
ownership of such intellectual property shall be owned as specified in said agreement. If 
the university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself to be the owner of 
the intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below. 
Procedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the 
university to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by an 
externally sponsored contract of the intellectual property provisions of that contract in 
advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to be in writing and the 
university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions by any person working 
on externally sponsored projects. A summary of external sponsorship agreements limiting 
the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of 
Sponsored Research and will be available to the general university community. 
If the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed 
on his intellectual property rights by external sponsorship agreements, the creator is 
entitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the 
university resulting from his intellectual property. 
3-2. Internally Sponsored Work 
Ownership Provisions: When the university provides funds or facilities for a particular 
project to the extent of substantial use, it may also choose to designate itself as sponsor 
of that work. The university may declare itself the owner of intellectual property resulting 
from said work. In such cases the university must specify in advance the disposition of any 
intellectual property rights arising from the project. If the university declares itself to be a 
sponsor, but does not declare itself the owner of the intellectual property, ownership shall 
be determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below. 
Procedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the 
university to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by 
internally sponsored work of the intellectual property ownership rights specified by the 
university as to that work in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to 

67 
 
 
be in writing and the university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions 
by any person working on internally sponsored projects. A summary of work for which 
university sponsorship limits the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be 
maintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general 
university community. 
If the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed 
on his intellectual property rights by internal university sponsorship, the creator is entitled 
to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university 
resulting from his intellectual property. 
3-3. Individual Agreements 
Ownership Provisions: Intellectual property which is the subject of a specific agreement 
between the university and the creator(s) thereof shall be owned as provided in said 
agreement. Such agreements by the university and the faculty are encouraged. 
Procedural Provisions: Except where limited by external sponsorship agreements, 
creators and the university may negotiate individual agreements to govern ownership of 
intellectual property regardless of the applicability of any other provision hereof. 
3-4. Intellectual Property Created Within Scope of Employment 
Ownership Provisions: Intellectual property created by university employees who were 
employed specifically to produce a particular intellectual property shall be owned by the 
university if said intellectual property was created within the normal scope of their 
employment. Faculty are presumed not to be hired to produce a particular intellectual 
property. On the other hand, computer programs written on the job by staff computer 
programmers would fall under this provision. 
3-5. Public Dedication 
Ownership Provisions: Except when limited by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3 or 3-4 above, the 
creator of any intellectual property may choose to place his or her creation in the public 
domain. In such cases both the creator and the university waive all ownership rights to 
said property. 
Procedural Provisions: Creators wishing to place their intellectual property in the public 
domain are responsible for ascertaining that the right to public dedication of that 
intellectual property is not limited by any external agreement, university sponsorship 
arrangement or terms of employment as described in Provisions 3-1, 3-2 or 3-3 above. 
The university provost will provide such a determination in writing upon request by the 
creator. It is also the creator's responsibility to ensure that disclosure does not include 

68 
 
 
valuable intellectual property owned by others. (This provision does not release the 
university from its general obligation to notify creators of limitations to intellectual 
property rights specified in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2 above.) 
To facilitate the actual transfer of knowledge of the intellectual property to the public at 
large, the creator shall provide the university with a complete description and 
documentation of the property placed in the public domain, specifically including a copy 
of the property in the case of printed material, and complete machine-readable source 
code in the case of software. All such material provided to the university will be placed in 
the University Library and made available to the public at large. The university will take 
appropriate action on a regular basis to publicize summary descriptions of intellectual 
property recently placed in the public domain. The university will also provide any 
member of the general public copies of such material on a cost-recovery basis. 
The provisions of this section do not apply to the normal scholarly or creative publication 
processes unless the creator intends to waive all proprietary rights to the publication. 
3-6. In General 
Unless governed by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 or 3-5 above, ownership of intellectual 
property created at the university shall be determined as follows: 
3-6-1. Traditional Rights Retained 
Ownership Provisions: In keeping with academic traditions at the university, the creator 
retains all rights to the following types of intellectual property, without limitation: books 
(including textbooks), educational courseware, articles, non-fiction, novels, poems, 
musical works, dramatic works including any accompanying music, pantomimes and 
choreographic works, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, motion pictures and other 
similar audio-visual works, and sound recordings, regardless of the level of use of 
university facilities. This provision does not include computer software (other than 
educational courseware) or data bases. 
Procedural Provisions: The types of intellectual property listed in the preceding 
paragraph share the attribute that they display information or visual or auditory 
appearances which are fully revealed to the purchaser or consumer. Thus, for example, 
source code listings would also be considered within this category. On the other hand, 
most computer software and data bases do not share this attribute; they are 
characterized by their capacity to perform tasks. Because of their utilitarian nature, 
ownership rights with respect thereto are governed by 3-6-3 or 3-6-4. Educational 
courseware is included in this provision in all cases because of its role in furthering the 
primary educational mission of the university. 

69 
 
 
This provision applies regardless of any university sponsorship of the work, and it may 
be modified only by a specific prior agreement between the creator and the university. 
The use of university-owned computers and other facilities in the preparation of books 
and similar works does not alter this provision, though other university policies may 
limit such use or require reimbursement to the university. Similarly, the use of externally 
sponsored resources does not alter this provision, unless the creator is effectively 
notified in advance of such limitations to his rights in accordance with 3-1. 
3-6-2. No Substantial Use of University Facilities 
Ownership Provisions: The creator owns all intellectual property created without 
substantial use of university facilities, including intellectual property rights in computer 
software and data bases. 
3-6-3. Substantial Use of University Facilities - No External or Internal Sponsorship 
Ownership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities, 
but not directly arising from externally sponsored work, or from work for which the 
university has declared itself as sponsor, shall be determined as set forth hereinafter 
depending on whether the creator or the university develops said property. 
3-6-3-1. Development by Creator 
Ownership Provisions: The creator originally owns intellectual property created with 
substantial use of university facilities but no external or internal sponsorship, and 
retains said ownership by commercial development of said property subject to the 
following: (i) the university shall receive 15% (fifteen percent) of the net proceeds to 
the creator above $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollars 
from all sources (in the case of patents and copyrights, this provision shall be limited 
to the life of the patent or copyright), and (ii) the university shall receive a perpetual, 
non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty free license to use said intellectual property. 
In the case of software, this license includes access by specified university personnel 
to the source listings, and the university shall require each person to whom a 
disclosure is made to execute in advance a binding confidentiality agreement in favor 
of and enforceable by the creator. If the intellectual property is created solely by a 
student or students, the creator is exempt from the obligation to pay to the 
university a fraction of his net proceeds, but not from the provision of this paragraph 
for a non-exclusive license to the university. 

70 
 
 
Procedural Provisions: If the creator develops an intellectual property that is covered 
by this provision, he must make full and fair disclosure to the University of all such 
sources of compensation relating to that intellectual property. 
3-6-3-2. Development by the University 
Ownership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of 
university facilities, but not directly arising from sponsored research, the creator will 
originally retain the rights to the property, provided that he desires to commercially 
develop the property himself or to make it available to the public. If, however, the 
creator elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in 
pursuing such development, then the ownership rights to that property may be 
acquired by the university. Intellectual property acquired by the university in this 
fashion will be treated as in 3-6-4-1 below. 
Procedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the 
university's provost as required under Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the 
university may request that the creator decide whether he will develop the 
intellectual property or will grant the rights to the university, and execute documents 
to pass on the title. Such a decision must be made within one year of the request or 
the creator will automatically lose his rights in favor of the university. 
3-6-4. Substantial Use of University Facilities - External or Internal Sponsorship 
Ownership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities 
and directly arising from work sponsored under an agreement between an external 
sponsor and the university, or from work for which the university has declared itself a 
sponsor, but for which neither the external sponsor nor the university have specified the 
ownership of resulting intellectual property shall be determined as set forth hereinafter 
depending on whether the creator or the university develops said property. 
3-6-4-1. Development by University 
Ownership Provisions: The University originally owns intellectual property created 
with substantial use of university facilities provided by an external agreement or 
internal university sponsorship and retains said ownership by commercial 
development of said property, subject to the following: in all cases, the creator shall 
receive 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university. 
Procedural Provisions: When an intellectual property is created with substantial use 
of university resources provided by an external research contract or a specific 
university sponsorship agreement, and when that contract or agreement either does 

71 
 
 
not specify the disposition of the intellectual property rights arising from that 
sponsorship, or it permits the university and/or creator to retain or acquire such 
intellectual property rights, the university will originally retain the rights to such 
intellectual property. 
3-6-4-2. Development by Creator 
Ownership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of 
university facilities provided by external or internal sponsorship, the university will 
originally retain the rights to the property, provided that it desires to commercially 
develop the property or to make it available to the public. If, however, the university 
elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in such 
development, the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the creator. 
Intellectual property acquired by the creator in this fashion will be treated as in 3-6-3-
1 above. This assignment of rights to the creator may be prohibited by the terms of 
an external sponsorship agreement with the university or by an internal university 
sponsorship declaration, but in such cases the creator must be notified in advance, 
as in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2. 
Procedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the 
university's provost as required by Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the creator 
may request that the university decide whether it will commercially develop the 
intellectual property or execute an assignment of the intellectual property rights to 
the creator. Such a decision must be made within 120 (one hundred twenty) days of 
the request or the university automatically waives its rights in favor of the creator, 
and it must execute an assignment of these rights to the creator. 
3-6-5. Consulting Agreements 
Ownership Provisions: Work done by individuals as consultants to outside firms is 
presumed not to involve unreimbursed substantial use of university facilities, and the 
rights to intellectual property created under consulting agreements are retained by the 
outside firms or the individual as specified by the terms of the consulting agreement 
and the terms of Provision 3-6-2 above. 
Procedural Provisions: Under university policy consulting work must not make 
substantial unreimbursed use of university facilities except by explicit prior agreement. 
Any member of the university community who is engaged in consulting work or in 
business is responsible for ensuring that provisions in his agreements are not in conflict 
with this policy of the university or with the university's commitments. The university's 
Innovation Transfer Office will, upon request, provide assistance in this respect. The 

72 
 
 
university's rights and the individual's obligations to the university are in no way 
abrogated or limited by the terms of such agreements. Each creator of intellectual 
property should make his obligations to the university clear to those with whom he 
makes such agreements and should ensure that they are provided with a current 
statement of the university's intellectual property policy. Appropriate sample contract 
wording to cover various possible external consulting arrangements shall be available 
from the university provost. 
4.  General Procedures 
4-1. 
The creator of any intellectual property that is or might be owned by the university under 
this policy is required to make reasonably prompt written disclosure of the work to the 
university's provost, and to execute any document deemed necessary to perfect legal 
rights in the university and enable the university to file patent applications and 
applications for copyright registration when appropriate. This disclosure to the provost 
should be made at the time when legal protection for the creation is contemplated, and it 
must be made before the intellectual property is sold, used for profit, or disclosed to the 
public. Whenever legal protection for intellectual property is anticipated all persons 
engaged in such creative activity are encouraged to keep regular notebooks and records. 
4-2. 
Whenever the university undertakes commercial development it shall do so, if possible, in 
a fashion that provides for the widest possible dissemination, avoiding suppression of 
inventions from which the public might otherwise benefit, providing for non-exclusive 
licensing at reasonable royalties, and giving consideration to more favorable or royalty-
free licensing to non-profit charitable institutions, minority businesses or enterprises in 
developing countries. 
4-3. 
The university's share of any proceeds under this policy will be used to reimburse the 
University for its expenses for commercial development of intellectual property. Any 
additional return to the university will be used to further the academic purposes of all the 
disciplines of the entire university. 
5.  Resolution of Disputes 
This policy constitutes an understanding which is binding on the university and on the 
faculty, staff, and students upon whom it is effective according to the terms of Section 6 

73 
 
 
below, as a condition for participating in research programs at the university or for the 
use of university funds or facilities. 
Any question of interpretation or claim arising out of or relating to this policy, or dispute 
as to ownership rights of intellectual property under this policy, will be settled by the 
following procedure: 
1. 
The issue must first be submitted to the university's Intellectual Property 
Adjudication Committee in the form of a letter setting forth the grievance or issue to 
be resolved. The committee will review the matter and then advise the parties of its 
decision within 60 days of submission of the letter. 
2. 
If any of the parties to the dispute is not satisfied with the committee's decision, the 
party may seek binding arbitration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in accordance 
with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment upon 
the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having 
jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) will give some weight to the decision of the 
Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee in reaching a decision. The losing party 
of the arbitration hearing will pay for all costs of the arbitration unless the 
arbitrator(s) specifies otherwise. 
The Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee will consist of a chair who is a member 
of the tenured faculty, four other members of the faculty, and four other members 
representing, respectively, the university administration, the technical staff, and the 
graduate and undergraduate student bodies. Initially, half of the members of the 
committee (including the chair) will be appointed for two-year terms of office, and the 
remaining half will be appointed for a one-year term. After one year new members of the 
committee will be appointed for two-year terms of office. The chair will be appointed by 
the chair of the Faculty Senate, with the advice and consent of the Faculty Senate 
Executive Committee, and the remaining eight members of the committee will be 
appointed by the president of the university or his designee. At all times at least one of 
the faculty members will have had significant practical experience with intellectual 
property development and exploitation. The faculty members appointed by the president 
of the university will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by the Faculty Senate or 
its designated committee and nominees with experience in intellectual property 
development will be identified as such by the Faculty Senate. The staff representative will 
be selected from a list of nominees prepared by Staff Council, and the administration 
representative will be named directly by the president of the university or his designee. 
The graduate student representative will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by 

74 
 
 
the Graduate Student Organization. The undergraduate representative will be chosen 
from a list of nominees prepared by the Student Senate. The committee will use the 
guidelines set forth in this policy to decide upon a fair resolution of any dispute. 
If possible, the committee will also provide on request informal advisory opinions to 
creators and the university indicating how it is likely to interpret the provisions of this 
policy as it applies to special cases. 
6.  Effective Date of Policy 
This policy will become effective August 27, 1985. Once effective this policy will be binding 
on new faculty, administration, and staff when hired, and on graduate and undergraduate 
students when admitted. Current faculty and staff will also become bound by this policy 
when they sign new employment contracts as the result of the renewal of limited-term 
appointments or promotion. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and 
current staff and students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and 
pending intellectual property by voluntary written consent. Unless the creator and the 
university agree to a different arrangement, intellectual property that is already partially 
developed at the time this policy becomes effective will be treated according to the 
provisions of the patent policy by which the creator is currently bound. Similarly, 
members of the university working under contracts signed before the effective date of 
this policy who do not choose to accept this policy will remain bound by the patent 
policies that already apply to them. With respect to intellectual property developed during 
the course of employment at the university, this policy shall continue to be binding on any 
person whose relationship with the university becomes terminated. The university should 
take all administrative steps necessary to ensure that employees and students sign, upon 
initial employment, registration or at other appropriate times, forms that indicate their 
acceptance of this policy. 
7.  Amendments of the Policy 
Amendments of this policy may be proposed by the Faculty Senate, Staff Council or 
university administration. Proposed amendments must be approved by a two-thirds 
majority of votes in the Faculty Senate and subsequently approved by a simple majority of 
votes cast in a referendum administered by the Faculty Senate that is open to all 
members of the faculty as defined by this policy and to the exempt staff, provided that 
this majority constitutes at least 25% (twenty-five percent) of those eligible to vote. This 
referendum must be preceded by an opportunity for public discussion open to all 
interested faculty, administration, staff and students. Amendments that are supported by 
the faculty and staff must then be approved by the president of the university and 

75 
 
 
adopted by the university trustees. Once adopted, amendments will become binding on 
new faculty, administration, and staff when hired, on existing faculty and staff when they 
sign new employment contracts, and on graduate and undergraduate students when 
admitted. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and current staff and 
students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and pending intellectual 
property by voluntary written consent. Intellectual property that is already developed or 
under development at the time that an amendment to the policy is ratified will not be 
bound by the terms of the amendment without the voluntary written consent of both the 
creator and the university.

Make-Up of Absence from Class Due to Illness 
When students are ill, they are expected to negotiate with professors the time and place for 
make-up of assignments, tests and/or examinations missed. For students who are seriously 
ill, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs (412-268-2075) should be contacted so that the 
student's academic area and/or professor may be contacted. 
Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy 
Statement 
Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon) complies with federal regulations to 
minimize potentially damaging ionizing radiation exposure to the embryos/fetuses of 
declared pregnant women working in radiologically restricted areas of the university. 
To ensure compliance, this policy mandates training for all employees and students who 
work in radiologically restricted areas regarding the effects of radiation on a developing 
embryo/fetus. It also mandates a procedure, to be implemented by the radiation safety 
officer, for ensuring that the radiation exposure of a woman who officially declares her 
pregnancy does not exceed the level set by federal regulations. 
Information and Training 
The radiation safety officer shall provide training sessions in which all students and 
employees, including supervisors, who are to work in restricted radiation areas are 
informed, orally and in writing, about this Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy and about 
potential radiation and non-radiation effects on a developing embryo/fetus. At these 
sessions, attendees are given the opportunity to have questions answered. The radiation 
safety officer may, at his or her discretion, administer an oral and/or written exam in 
order to confirm attendees' understanding of the subject matter. 
The radiation safety officer obtains from each attendee a signed acknowledgment of 
understanding of the Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy. No employee or student may 
enter a radiologically restricted area before attending such a training session and signing 
such an acknowledgment of understanding. 

77 
 
 
Any declared pregnant employee or student who performs work that results in radiation 
exposure at other, non-Carnegie Mellon University locations is responsible for informing 
the Radiation Safety Office of those activities. 
Declaration of Pregnancy 
Any employee or student who works in a radiologically restricted area of the university 
and determines she is pregnant may officially declare her pregnancy to the radiation 
safety officer. To be considered an official declaration of pregnancy, this must be in 
writing and contain the estimated date of conception. An official declaration of pregnancy 
form can be obtained from the radiation safety officer. 
A pregnant woman has no obligation to officially declare her pregnancy. 
Limiting Exposure 
Upon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, the radiation safety officer shall work 
with the declared pregnant woman's supervisor to review the work being performed by 
the declared pregnant woman and determine whether exposure is likely to exceed 500 
milligrams during the pregnancy and/or likely to substantially vary from month to month 
during the pregnancy. If exposure greater than 500 millirems or significant variation is 
determined to be likely, the radiation safety officer and supervisor shall identify and 
implement appropriate precautions and engineering controls to limit radiation dose 
and/or decrease month-to-month variations. 
The radiation safety officer shall also, upon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, 
complete a dose assessment on the declared pregnant woman, including sending her 
whole body radiation dosimeter to an approved laboratory for processing, and possibly 
including bioassay by urinalysis. The radiation safety officer shall communicate to the 
declared pregnant woman the results of the dose assessment. 
Once a month, the radiation safety officer shall monitor the external occupational dose to 
a declared pregnant woman using a whole body radiation dosimeter, unless the radiation 
safety officer considers it unlikely that the embryo/fetus will receive, from sources outside 
the body of the declared pregnant woman, a dose in excess of 100 milligrams during the 
course of the pregnancy. 
The radiation safety officer shall monitor the occupational intake, by bioassay if necessary, 
of radioactive material by a declared pregnant woman, unless the radiation safety officer 
considers it unlikely that the declared pregnant woman will receive a "Committed Effective 
Dose Equivalent" in excess of 100 milligrams during the course of the pregnancy, in 

78 
 
 
accordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, "Standards for Protection 
Against Radiation." 
If the declared pregnant woman's exposure approaches 350 milligrams prior to the end of 
the gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall recommend to the declared 
pregnant woman and her work supervisor that she reduce her use of radioactive 
materials. If the declared pregnant woman's exposure reaches or exceeds 450 milligrams 
prior to the end of the gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall notify her 
supervisor, remove her radiation dosimeters and rescind her authorization to use 
radioactive material for the remainder of her pregnancy. 
Declared pregnant women desiring to further limit their exposure may do so. Any 
resulting changes in work routine are to be coordinated with their work supervisor. 
Records 
The radiation safety officer shall maintain all official declarations of pregnancy and 
exposure records in accordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, 
"Standards for Protection Against Radiation."

Procedure for the Appeal of Grades and Academic Actions for 
Undergraduate Students 
In the event a student believes an assigned grade or an imposed academic action is incorrect 
or not appropriate, the student may follow the processes outlined below to seek prompt and 
equitable resolution of the matter. 
If a student believes a grade has been incorrectly assigned, the student should: 
1. 
Present the case to the faculty member responsible for the course, providing all 
supporting data concerning the nature of the discrepancy. This action should be taken 
as soon as possible but no later than one year after the final course grade was issued. 
2. 
If, after a decision is rendered, the student believes that his or her concerns have not 
been adequately resolved, the student may pursue a formal appeal with the department 

79 
 
 
responsible for the course. To appeal to the department, a student must present a 
written statement detailing the grounds for the appeal with appropriate documentation 
to the department head of the department responsible for the course. This appeal must 
be within seven (7) days of the faculty member's decision.  The department head will 
provide a written decision, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon 
thereafter as practical. 
3. 
If the student is not satisfied with the department head's resolution, the student may 
pursue the appeal at the college level. To appeal at the college level, the student must 
present copies of all documents originally sent to the faculty member and department 
head, along with a formal letter of appeal, to the dean of the college responsible for the 
course. This appeal must be submitted within seven (7) days of the department head's 
decision. The dean, or the dean's designate, will review the appeal and will render a 
written decision, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as 
practical. 
If a student believes an academic action is inconsistent with the policies of the college, a 
student should: 
1. 
Submit a formal written appeal to the associate dean of the college responsible for the 
decision, with a copy to the dean, requesting review of the action including all relevant 
materials to substantiate the inconsistency in policy and to support their concerns. 
2. 
The dean of the college, or the dean's designate, will review the appeal and issue a 
decision and the basis for it within 30 days. 
If, after carrying out the steps of either process described above, the student believes that 
the matter has not been adequately resolved, or if no decision has been rendered by the 
appropriate date, the student may appeal at the university level. To appeal at the university 
level, the student must present copies of all documents and a formal letter of appeal to the 
provost. The provost or another designated university officer will respond in writing with a 
final resolution, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as 
practical.

Research Proposals: Government, Corporations and Foundations 
Policy 
Policy Statement 
Sponsored research is an important part of the mission of the university and accounts for 
a significant portion of the university's expenditures in a given year. The large amount of 
research that is supported by government, industry and foundations brings with it a 
myriad of constantly changing legal, financial and administrative requirements which 
must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of all these factors, it is important 
that all proposals, contracts and agreements related to research activities be reviewed 
centrally to ensure compliance with government regulations and university policies. 
Signatures and Approvals 
In general, research proposals require two sets of signatures: those required by the 
funding organization and those required by Carnegie Mellon. No proposal should be sent 
out of the university without the appropriate signatures. 
All research proposals to the government and to corporations should be circulated 
internally and should be accompanied by a Carnegie Mellon Proposal Routing and Sign-off 
Sheet. The sign-off sheet ensures that everyone involved in the process has had the 
opportunity to review the proposal. 
The following signatures are required on the sign-off sheet: 
• Principal investigators: their signatures state that they understand their commitments 
to the project and agree to meet their obligations as set forth in the proposal. 
• Deans and the department heads: their signatures attest that they support the 
proposal and that all matters relating to space, facilities and personnel can be resolved 
within the department and the college. In instances of joint proposals, signatures from 
all department heads and deans are required. 
• Signatures from the Office of Sponsored Research and Provost's Office indicate that 
the proposal and the budget have been reviewed and that they meet the requirements 
of both the university and the potential sponsor. 
Research proposals to foundations - whether initiated within the college or the 
Development Office - must also be reviewed and signed by the Provost's Office. 

81 
 
 
Negotiation of the Award 
After an award is made to the university, the Office of Sponsored Research will enter into 
sponsored research or contract negotiations. The principal investigator will be responsible 
for negotiating technical aspects of the agreement. The remainder of the negotiations will 
be the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research or the Office of the Associate 
Provost for Research and Academic Administration. All research agreements must be 
signed by either the provost or the associate provost for research and academic 
administration. No other personnel are authorized to commit the university to a research 
agreement. 
Restricted Research Policy 
Statement 
Universities have two primary purposes: to create knowledge and to disseminate 
knowledge. Carnegie Mellon University recognizes the importance of open intellectual 
communication within a research group, within the university, and within the larger 
community outside. Ideally, all units of the university would disseminate the results of 
research as quickly and as widely as possible. Some members or units of the university, 
however, desire to do research that may be difficult or impossible without restrictions or 
without access to classified or proprietary materials. 
There exists, therefore, a tension between the university's goal of disseminating 
knowledge freely and the desire on the part of some of its members to conduct restricted 
research on important problems. The university intends to guarantee the academic 
freedom of all faculty members to do research in their own manner on topics of their own 
choosing, provided that such research is consistent with the overall purposes of the 
university. 
This policy seeks to resolve the tension between the desire to participate in restricted 
research and the desire to maintain the open atmosphere of the university by confining 
restricted research to semi-autonomous units, which are not associated with any 
academic departments. It thereby establishes the principle that restricted research is 
inappropriate at Carnegie Mellon University except in the semi-autonomous units. 
This policy does not attempt to anticipate all possible concerns about restricted research. 
In some cases, decisions will need to be made about particular research projects to which 
the application of particular policy guidelines are not clear. In choosing to accept or 
decline such projects, the university will weigh the potential of a project for generating 

82 
 
 
and disseminating new knowledge, for the benefit of society, against the project's 
potential for adversely affecting the climate for research conducted in a free and open 
environment. While this policy sets no explicit limits on the extent of classified research 
permitted in the semi-autonomous units, it is not the intent of the policy to encourage any 
unit of the university to engage in classified research as a primary ongoing activity. 
Indeed, it is expected that classified projects will never represent more than a small 
fraction of the total research effort in any unit. 
Definitions 
• Research: all projects and investigations involving the creation of new knowledge of a 
theoretical or practical nature. The term "research" as used here encompasses both 
"research" and "development" as they are commonly defined. 
• Classified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed 
to jeopardize national security. The federal government controls access to the 
environment in which such research is performed, restricts discussions about the work 
in progress to individuals with clearance and a "need to know," and limits publication 
of research, results or access to data needed to verify results, for a specified period of 
time. 
• Proprietary research: research that results in intellectual property that is owned by 
entities other than Carnegie Mellon University. Such entities may wish to market 
products derived from inventions or ideas that are developed at the university. They 
might, therefore, desire to fund projects which restrict access to data and to 
discussions about work in progress to individuals with a "need to know," and to seek, 
for a specified period of time, a delay in publication of research results or data needed 
to verify results. Such entities may also provide access to proprietary material, which 
researchers must agree not to include in publications. 
• Publication: oral or written dissemination. 
• Restricted research: includes all classified research, and any proprietary or other 
research that requires more than a six month delay in publication of the research 
results. 
• Semi-autonomous units: units of the university specifically so designated by the 
president, after consultation with the URC and the Faculty Senate, currently the Mellon 
Institute and the Software Engineering Institute. 
• Non-autonomous units: all university entities other than semi-autonomous units. 

83 
 
 
Restricted Research in Non-Autonomous Units 
It is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that restricted research is inappropriate and, therefore, 
not permitted within its non-autonomous units. 
It is also the policy of Carnegie Mellon not to permit involvement of students in projects 
which carry restrictions that may impede their progress toward a degree. Therefore, 
students should not be involved in contracts that require the delay of a student's 
publication of research results when such results are intended for use in obtaining 
academic credit, except that a sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of 
publications for removal of proprietary information that was provided by the sponsor for 
the conduct of the research. 
Proprietary research is allowed within non-autonomous units provided it is subject to 
limitations (excluding students' publications as noted above) no more stringent than the 
following: 
• A sponsor may request a delay of up to six months in publication so that steps may be 
taken to secure intellectual property rights to inventions or ideas developed under the 
contract. 
• A sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of 
proprietary information which was provided for the conduct of the research. 
Considerations for Faculty/Researchers 
The university recognizes that problems arise in both restricted research and research 
that is not itself restricted but that involves access to classified or propriety information or 
materials (hereinafter, restricted materials). Researchers may also have access to 
restricted materials when serving as consultants. Access to restricted materials gives rise 
to concerns about limitations on researchers' freedom to communicate. In such instances, 
researchers must exercise considerable judgment to conduct their research in an open 
environment while protecting the restricted materials to which they have access. 
Researchers must also be aware that the university will judge their performance as 
researchers through their publications or through other scholarly products that arise 
from their research. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for 
public review, cannot be considered in promotion or reappointment decisions or in 
evaluations of academic performance of any kind. 
Considerations for Students 
There are important concerns about the involvement of students in restricted research. It 
is necessary for students to publish their work in order to obtain degrees, course credit 

84 
 
 
and professional recognition. Students rely to a large degree on their faculty advisor's 
judgment for guidance and advice. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not 
available for public review, cannot be used for academic credit. Thus, before working on 
such research, a student must be notified in writing that work on this research may not be 
used for academic credit. 
Restricted Research in Semi-Autonomous Units 
The semi-autonomous units associated with Carnegie Mellon may conduct restricted 
research. 
Faculty members may conduct restricted research in or in cooperation with semi-
autonomous units only on a consulting basis or by means of a formal, internal leave of 
absence from their non-autonomous units. 
Work that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is 
released for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions. 
Students may occasionally be employed by the semi-autonomous units, provided that 
such employment does not interfere substantially with progress toward a degree. 
However, they must be made aware that work that is restricted cannot be used for 
academic credit. Work that was restricted and is later released for dissemination and 
review can be applied toward future academic credit. Students should be discouraged 
from working on restricted research in which dissemination may be delayed indefinitely. 
Guidelines for all Units 
Work by students on restricted research projects shall not be made a condition for 
admission or financial aid. 
The principal investigator is responsible for informing all members of a project (faculty, 
staff and students) of any restrictions imposed on the dissemination of information 
related to the research. This must be done prior to the start of the project or prior to an 
individual joining an existing project. 
Restrictions on access to university facilities due to the conduct of restricted research 
must be kept to a minimum. Access to and movement through the facilities in which 
restricted research is conducted must be consistent with standard university procedures. 
The Provost's Office is responsible for obtaining signed documents from principal 
investigators on restricted research projects attesting that they are aware of all 
restrictions imposed on the research and that they have informed all participants of these 
restrictions. 

85 
 
 
The Office of Sponsored Research shall review all proposals and contracts prior to 
approval for conformity with these guidelines. Any that do not meet these guidelines will 
be referred to the University Research Council (URC) for review and recommendation of 
appropriate action to the provost. 
To maintain a balance with the university's goals of broad dissemination of knowledge, 
the URC will conduct an annual review of all restricted research being conducted at the 
university. This review will be made based on a listing of all contracts that involve 
restricted research. This listing shall include the title and sponsor(s) of the research, 
name(s) of principal investigator(s), and the amount of funding of each contract. 
The university community will be informed annually, through the URC's written report to 
the Faculty Senate and Student Senate, of the nature and overall impact of restricted 
research at Carnegie Mellon. 
Existing sponsored research projects shall be allowed to continue under the terms of their 
present contract. However, renewal contracts must conform with this policy. 
Retention of Student Work Policy 
The university reserves the right in all colleges to retain indefinitely any student work the 
faculty may select. All work not retained by the university must be claimed at the time 
specified on the bulletin boards (or other forms of communication) of the department 
concerned; otherwise, the work will be destroyed. 
Statute of Limitations – Master’s Studies 
Students will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven 
years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more 
restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the 
person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently 
offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. 
Under extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family 
or parental leave, or temporary disability, a college/school may, upon the relevant 
department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), 
defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students 
who are pursuing the master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their 
program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for 
extension of the time to degree limit. 

86 
 
 
Statute of Limitations – Undergraduate Students 
All units required for an undergraduate degree, whether earned in residence, transferred 
from another institution or granted via advanced placement, must have been earned within 
eight years of the date on which the degree is granted. This statutory period can be extended 
by the dean of the student's college under the following conditions: 
• the courses taken prior to the statutory period still represent a reasonable part of the 
student's total academic program; 
• the prior courses provide adequate preparation for courses which must still be taken to 
fulfill the degree requirements; 
• there is a legitimate reason(s) for the student not completing the academic program 
within the statutory period. 
A request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be submitted to the dean of the 
student's college. The request for a waiver should address all of the above conditions for an 
extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver covers specific courses and is 
intended for a specific period during which the program must be completed. 
Student Leaves Policy 
Policy Statement 
Students must sometimes interrupt their studies for a variety of reasons (financial, 
academic or personal). Students choosing to take a leave of absence must first contact 
their department advisor to discuss their plans while on leave to work out any conditions 
that may be necessary for a smooth return to Carnegie Mellon. 
A student may leave Carnegie Mellon by either withdrawing from the university (this 
means leaving the university with no intention of returning) or by taking a leave of 
absence (this means leaving the university temporarily, with the firm and stated intention 
of returning). 
A Leave of Absence Form must be completed by all students requesting a leave of 
absence. A Withdrawal Form must be completed by all students who are withdrawing. 
Notifying instructors or no longer attending classes does not complete the process. Forms 
are available on The HUB website. Not completing the leave form results in tuition being 
charged to midpoint of the semester or the last date the student attended an 
academically-related activity such as an exam, tutorial or study group, or the last day a 
student turned in a class assignment. 

87 
 
 
Students are required to fill out all information on the form, including all comment 
sections relating to reasons for their leave of absence. After completion of the form, 
students must take it to their home department and dean's office for appropriate 
signatures. The process of taking a leave will not be complete until all necessary 
signatures are on the leave form. Under certain circumstances, students may also need 
the Dean of Student Affairs to sign off on the leave form. International students who are 
here on a F1 or J1 visa must consult the Office of International Education for information 
on possible visa implications prior to going on leave. 
Students on leave are not permitted to live in university housing, attend classes or 
maintain employment as students at Carnegie Mellon while their leave is in effect. 
Doctoral candidates in ABD (All But Dissertation) status who wish to take a leave of 
absence should refer to the Doctoral Student Status policy. 
Leaves during the academic semester will take effect as of the date signed by the 
student's dean. After the Leave of Absence or Withdrawal Form is received by the 
University's Registrar's Office, it will be reviewed for the appropriate tuition refunds (see 
Enrollment Services: Tuition and Fees Adjustment Policy) and grade implications. The 
recording of student courses and grades for taking a leave in a semester follows the 
deadlines for semester or mini courses, as follows: 
• On or before the university semester course drop deadline: all courses and grades are 
removed. 
• After the university semester course drop deadline through the last day of classes: W 
(withdrawal) grades will be assigned to all classes. (W grades apply to all 
undergraduate students, and graduate students in the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, the Heinz College, the Mellon College of Science and the Tepper School of 
Business.) 
• After the last day of classes: Permanent grades assigned by the instructor will be 
recorded. 
Student Parental Accommodation Protocols 
Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this 
policy are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families. 
Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with 
the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs by contacting the office for an appointment by 
calling 412-268-2075. 

88 
 
 
Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days 
in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance.  
At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, 
procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with 
the student’s academic department.  Students should also consult with their academic 
advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of 
Students. 
Accommodations for Gestational Parents 
The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic 
pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose 
anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away 
from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are 
afforded two options as possible accommodation: 
• Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents – A short term absence from 
academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks.  Short-Term 
Accommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where 
a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with 
relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and 
other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include 
extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping 
courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who 
take a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.  
• Formal Leave of Absence– A formal leave of absence under the Student Leaves Policy.  
Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-
semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the 
leave is taken.  Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence drop all remaining courses 
for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester.  International students must 
consult with the Office of International Education before considering this option due to 
visa implications. 
Parental Accommodation for Doctoral Students 
The university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to 
include up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued 
stipend support. This accommodation can be utilized within six months of the birth or 
placement of a child through adoption, foster care or legal guardianship. Gestational 

89 
 
 
parents may utilize both the Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents and the 
parental accommodation. 
Careful planning and consultation is necessary given the unique contexts and 
requirements of each student’s situation. Students will remain fully enrolled and will 
receive assistance in navigating the necessary planning and consultation processes. 
Financial Assistance for Student Parents 
Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who 
become parents while enrolled: 
• Interest Free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an 
interest-free Parental Loan from the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.  
• Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who are the 
gestational parent and who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are 
eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-
Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents or during a Formal Leave of Absence. 
Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of 
eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. 
• Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Non-gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who 
receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon and are becoming a parent by 
adoption, birth, or through guardianship are eligible to continue to receive stipend 
funding for up to four (4) weeks during a Short-Term Parental Accommodation. 
Lactation Rooms 
As a service to our community members, Carnegie Mellon offers several lactation rooms for 
the purpose of expressing milk while on campus. These spaces are open to all CMU 
community members and their guests. More information available here.

• The university will inform you of its decision, in writing, including a summary of the 
evidence presented and the reasons for its decision, no later than 45 days after the 
hearing. 
• If the university decides not to amend the record, you have a right to add a statement 
to the record that explains your side of the story. 
4. Disclosure 
Carnegie Mellon generally will not disclose personally identifiable information from your 
education records without your consent except for directory information and other 
exceptions specified by law. 
What is directory information? 
Directory information is personally identifiable information of a general nature that may 
be disclosed without your consent, unless you specifically request the university not to do 
so. It is used for purposes like compiling campus directories. 
If you do not want your directory information to be disclosed, you must notify the University 
Registrar's Office, in writing, within the first 15 days of the semester. 
Notifying the University Registrar's Office covers only the disclosure of centralized 
records. Members of individual organizations such as fraternities, sororities, athletics, etc. 
must also notify those organizations to restrict the disclosure of directory information. 
Carnegie Mellon has defined directory information as the following: 
• your full name 
• local/campus address 
• local/campus telephone number 
• email user id and address  
(User ids cannot be completely suppressed from our electronic systems. While it may 
be possible to suppress the association of an individual's name with their user id, 
doing so may adversely impact the delivery of electronic mail or other electronic 
services.) 
• major, department, college 
• academic advisor name 
• class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, undergraduate, or graduate) 

93 
 
 
• dates of attendance (semester begin and end dates) 
• enrollment status (full, half, or part time) 
• date(s) of graduation 
• degrees awarded 
• sorority or fraternity affiliation 
For students participating in intercollegiate athletics, directory information also includes: 
• height, weight 
• sport of participation 
What are the other exceptions? 
Under FERPA, Carnegie Mellon may release personally identifiable information from your 
education records without your prior consent to: 
• school officials with legitimate educational interests ("School officials" are Carnegie 
Mellon employees in administrative, supervisory, academic or support staff positions; 
Carnegie Mellon trustees; individuals and companies with whom the university has 
contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using university employees such 
as attorneys, auditors, or collection agencies; and individuals assisting school officials 
in performing their tasks. School officials have a "legitimate educational interest" if 
they need to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional 
responsibilities.); 
• certain federal officials in connection with federal program requirements; 
• organizations involved in awarding financial aid; 
• state and local officials who are legally entitled to the information; 
• testing agencies such as the Educational Testing Service, for the purpose of 
developing, validating, researching and administering tests; 
• accrediting agencies, in connection with their accrediting functions; 
• parents of dependent students (as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue 
Service Code); 
• comply with a judicial order or subpoena (after making a reasonable effort to notify 
the student in advance of compliance so that the student can take protective action, 

94 
 
 
except in cases where the university is legally required not to disclose the existence of 
the subpoena); 
• appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency, if necessary to protect the health 
or safety of the student or other individuals; 
• officials of another school in which the student seeks or intends to enroll; 
• victims of violent crimes or non-forcible sexual offenses (the results of final student 
disciplinary proceedings); 
• parents or legal guardians of students under 21 years of age (information regarding 
violations of university drug and alcohol policies); 
• courts (records relevant to legal actions initiated by students, parents or the 
university); 
• comply with federal laws concerning sex offenders and other individuals required to 
register under section 170101 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994. 
5. Complaints 
If you believe the university has not complied with FERPA, you can file a complaint with 
the: 
Family Policy Compliance Office 
Department of Education 
400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. 
Washington, DC 20202-4605 
Note: Your Carnegie Mellon GUID (global user identification) number is also designated as 
directory information under FERPA, but does not contain personally identifiable 
information and therefore cannot be used by itself to determine your identity or to access 
your records. 
Student Return Policy 
Students on leave wishing to return to Carnegie Mellon to resume their degree studies may 
do so under several conditions. In order to be considered for return from leave, a student 
must first obtain an Application for Return form from The HUB or their academic 
department. This application requires information from the student regarding the intended 

95 
 
 
semester of return, current address information and information about their leave. This 
application must be submitted to their home department at least one month prior to the 
beginning of the semester. 
Undergraduates may return within their same academic department within two years. After 
two years, students returning in the same academic department are subject to space 
constraints and academic performance review. Graduate students must negotiate their 
return with their home department and must follow their department policy. 
The Application for Return requires approval of the student's academic department and 
dean. If a student's department chooses to deny the student's Application for Return, the 
student may appeal to their dean. Any constraints governing the student's eligibility to return 
will be specified directly on the application by the academic department and/or dean's office 
or the Office of Student Affairs. 
Students who have taken courses elsewhere must submit an official transcript and course 
descriptions with their Application for Return. Transfer credit approval is determined by the 
academic department based on course level, performance and appropriateness to the 
student's curriculum requirements. Credit transfer is subject to college-specific policy. Failure 
to submit the necessary documents at the time of return will result in denial of transfer 
credit. 
The process of returning is not completed until all necessary signatures on the Return form 
are obtained by the student and until all outstanding bills are paid. Enrollment Services will 
then notify the appropriate university offices of the student's return. 
Students’ Rights Policy 
The primary right of students is to pursue their education so long as they maintain their 
eligibility to remain a member of the community by meeting its academic standards and so 
long as they observe the regulations imposed by the university for the governance of the 
academic community. 
The second right of students is to be recognized as members of the student body, with all the 
privileges pursuant thereto as to use of physical plant, university services and facilities. 
Every student has the constitutional rights and responsibilities of any citizen under the law. 
Conversely, a responsibility of any student is to respect these rights of any other member of 
the university community. 
A student has the right to expect that academic and professional processes should be flexible 
and periodically open to review and to participate constructively with faculty and 

96 
 
 
administration in those processes by which the university community maintains the 
excellence of the standards of its curriculum and methods of instruction and the viability of 
its total educational program. 
The student has the right to recourse through the procedures outlined in The Word/Student 
Handbook against unreasonable academic action. 
Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy 
Policy Statement 
University Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three 
types of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate 
students: 
Academic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic 
regulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see 
university and college academic policies). 
Disciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the 
Office of Student Affairs (see The Word: Student Handbook). 
Administrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial obligations or 
failure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is imposed by 
Enrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures 
for financial obligations. Contact University Health Services for information about health 
regulations.) 
Suspended students may not: 
• register for courses 
• attend classes 
• live in student or fraternity/sorority housing 
• use campus facilities, including athletic facilities, library and computer clusters 
• participate in student activities 
• be members of student organizations 
• have student jobs 
(Note: students on academic suspension may have a summer campus job if they accepted 
the job before they were suspended.) 

97 
 
 
Employment 
Although suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic 
suspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non-student job with the university; 
students on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not. 
To have a non-student job, students on academic suspension must receive approval from 
their associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students) to 
ensure that the job will not violate their suspension terms. Students in violation of this will 
lose their degree student status, meaning they would have to reapply for admission to 
Carnegie Mellon through either Undergraduate Admission or the appropriate graduate 
department. 
Transfer Credit 
Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer 
credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this. 
Appeals 
To appeal any action of this policy, the student may write to the following people: 
Academic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head 
(graduate students); 
Disciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; 
Administrative Suspension - vice president for enrollment, vice president for business and 
planning, and the dean of student affairs, in consultation with the student's associate 
dean. 
Returning from Suspension 
In order to return from a suspension, a student must have the following approval: 
Academic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head 
(graduate students); 
Disciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; 
Administrative Suspension - vice president for campus affairs or designate. 

98 
 
 
Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures 
Introduction 
Set forth below is a summary of the processes available to graduate students who seek 
review of academic and non-academic issues.  Generally, graduate students are expected 
to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or 
program before invoking formal processes.  When an informal resolution cannot be 
reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow 
these formal procedures.  To the extent that these processes are set forth in official 
University policies, links to those statements of policy and more detailed description of 
processes and procedures are included. Where a graduate student's concerns implicate 
multiple policies or processes, the University reserves the right to decide which process 
shall apply in order to avoid duplicative and potentially conflicting processes and 
decisions, or in appropriate circumstances, the order in which multiple reviews may occur.   
These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs 
of the University.  Students should refer to the online handbooks (or hard copy 
handbooks if applicable) for their particular programs for more detailed information 
about the administration and academic policies of the program.  To the extent that these 
policies conflict in any way with policies, processes and procedures adopted at the 
College, Department or Program level, the policies set forth herein shall govern. 
Appealing Final Grades 
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval 
of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound 
discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the 
instructor who assigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual 
exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is 
based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade 
or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who 
assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.  
A graduate student who believes a final grade was assigned pursuant to (a) or (b) above 
should first present the case informally to the faculty or staff member responsible for the 
course in which the student believes an inappropriate grade has been awarded. Grade 
appeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than one year after the final 
course grade was issued.  If the student is not satisfied with the resolution at this first 
step, the student shall submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation 

99 
 
 
to the head of the department in which the course was offered.  The department head (or 
the program head if the department head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) 
will issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as 
practical.  If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the department head (or 
program head), the student may submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate 
documentation, within seven (7) days to the Dean of the college in which the course is 
offered. The Dean shall render a decision within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as 
practical.  The decision of the Dean shall be final and not appealable. 
Summary of Levels of Appeal for Final Grades: 
• Informal discussion with the faculty member 
• Formal written appeal to the department head (or the program head if the department 
head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) 
• Formal written appeal to the Dean 
• Dean issues final non-appealable decision 
See, also, Carnegie Mellon University Grading Policies. 
Appeal of Academic Actions 
An "Academic Action" is an action by a program, unit or department based on a graduate 
student's academic performance or failure to satisfy academic program requirements.  
Examples of Academic Actions include, but are not limited to, academic probation, 
academic suspension, and dismissal/drop.  Each college, department, or program may set 
its own academic requirements and standards for acceptable academic performance.  
These standards and benchmarks for performance are set forth in the online and/or hard 
copy handbooks for individual graduate programs. 
Graduate students will be notified of an academic action in writing by the applicable 
department, unit, or program head or director, or designated committee.  Graduate 
students are encouraged to seek informal resolution of any concerns related to academic 
actions informally within the department, unit or program before filing a formal appeal.   
Graduate students who wish to appeal an Academic Action must submit a formal, written 
appeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Dean of the College within seven (7) 
calendar days after receipt of written notice of the academic action by the department, 
unit, or program head or director, or designated committee.  The Dean may delegate 
review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not limited to one 
of the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted grievance committee 

100 
 
 
who shall make a recommendation to the Dean.  The Dean shall render a decision on the 
appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical.  
Graduate students who wish to appeal the written decision of the Dean must submit a 
formal written appeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Provost within fourteen 
(14) calendar days after receipt of the Dean's decision.  A copy of the appeal must also be 
submitted to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education and to the Dean.  The 
Provost may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including 
but not limited to the Vice Provost for Education who shall make a recommendation to 
the Provost.  The Provost shall render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as 
soon thereafter as practical.  Decisions by the Provost are final and not appealable.   
Generally, sanctions resulting from an Academic Action (e.g. probation, suspension, or 
dismissal /drop) take effect immediately, regardless of whether an appeal is filed.  In 
exceptional circumstances, however, the appropriate Dean or the Provost may elect to 
hold sanctions in abeyance pending the resolution of an appeal. 
Summary of Levels of Appeal for Academic Actions: 
• Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program 
• Formal written appeal to the Dean 
• Decision rendered by the Dean 
• Formal written appeal to the Provost  
• Provost issues final non-appealable decision 
Appeal from Academic Disciplinary Actions 
Academic Disciplinary Actions are sanctions and outcomes imposed when any student 
violates the University Policy on Academic integrity including cheating, plagiarism an 
unauthorized assistance. 
The Office of Community Standards and Integrity manages the Academic Disciplinary 
Process and provides resources to all students, faculty and staff. The process for 
appealing an academic integrity violation can be found under the Academic Disciplinary 
Actions Index. 
Community Standards Violations 
As members of the University community, Carnegie Mellon students are expected to 
respect the rights of all students, faculty and staff and adhere to the policies outlined in 

101 
 
 
the Student Handbook contained in The Word, the University Policies website, and any 
applicable college, department or graduate program handbooks. 
If a student has observed a violation of university policy or law, or feels harmed by 
another student's misconduct (e.g. affecting his/her welfare, property, safety or security) 
he/she should file a report with the Dean of Student Affairs and/or University Police as 
appropriate. 
The procedures for adjudicating community standards violations and for appealing the 
results are available in The Word under Community Standards.  
For more information about community standards and disciplinary procedures, please 
visit the Community Standards website. 
Summary of Levels of Appeal for Community Standards Violations 
Harassment 
Carnegie Mellon is firmly committed to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and 
expression and respect for the dignity of each individual.  Acts of harassment or 
intimidation by a student toward any member of the campus community will not be 
tolerated. Graduate students with concerns or grievances related to harassment or 
intimidation by another student should contact the Dean of Student Affairs for resolution.  
Acts of harassment or intimidation by a student may be referred to the University 
Committee on Discipline. 
Graduate Students with concerns or grievances related to alleged harassment or 
intimidation by a staff member, faculty member or other member of the campus 
community should contact the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources, People & 
Organizational Effectiveness at 412-268-9685 for resolution. 
Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault 
Graduate student grievances or concerns relating to sexual harassment will be handled 
according to the University's Policy against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault.  Any 
member of the university community, whether faculty member, student, or staff member, 
who believes she or he has been the victim of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault or 
is aware of such conduct, is encouraged to make contact with any of the individuals 
identified in the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) under Section V.B. They will make 
certain that your complaint is communicated to the appropriate resource for handling. 

102 
 
 
Intellectual Property Disputes 
Disputes concerning rights to intellectual property must be resolved according to the 
procedures set forth in the University's Intellectual Property Policy. 
Research Misconduct 
Carnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the 
University. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the 
University has established procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of 
research with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the 
allegations, and the University.  The procedures for handling allegations of research 
misconduct are set forth in the Policy for Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research at 
Carnegie Mellon University. 
For graduate students found responsible for research misconduct, the President of the 
University may impose specific sanctions up to and including expulsion.  The imposition of 
sanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal prescribed for 
community standards violations. 
Return from Leave of Absence 
Graduate students who wish to return to Carnegie Mellon following a leave of absence 
must follow the procedures set forth in the Student Return Policy. 
Generally, graduate students must negotiate their return to the University with their 
home academic department and follow any applicable departmental policies.  If a 
department chooses to deny a student's return from a leave of absence, the student may 
appeal to the Dean of the College. 
Suspension/Required Withdrawal 
A University Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three 
types of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate 
students: 
• Academic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of 
academic regulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department 
(see university and college academic policies). 
• Disciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by 
the Dean of Student Affairs (see The Word/Student Handbook). 
• Administrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial 
obligations or failure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is 

103 
 
 
imposed by Enrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy 
and Procedures for financial obligations. Contact Student Health Services for 
information about health regulations.) 
Graduate students who wish to appeal a suspension or required withdrawal may write to 
the following individuals depending on the type of suspension: 
• Academic Suspension – The applicable department, unit, or program head 
• Disciplinary Suspension – Dean of Student Affairs 
• Administrative Suspension –Vice President for Enrollment, Vice President for Business 
and Planning, and the Dean of Student Affairs, in consultation with the student’s 
Associate Dean 
For more details see the Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy. 
General Grievances 
The following grievance procedures are to be used for graduate student problems or 
concerns that are not covered by any of the policies or procedures set forth above.  As 
such, these grievance procedures may not be used as a substitute for procedures 
contemplated under any other policy, including but not limited to, policies regarding 
academic actions; academic disciplinary actions; community standards; harassment; 
sexual harassment; intellectual property; research misconduct or any other policy. 
Graduate students are expected to discuss any concerns or grievances initially with the 
faculty or staff member(s) involved. Students are strongly encouraged to seek informal 
resolution of grievances through consultations within the academic unit, department or 
program.  Students may also seek assistance with the informal resolution of a grievance 
through the Vice Provost for Education.   
If a grievance cannot be resolved informally with the faculty or staff member involved 
within the academic department, a student may submit a formal, written grievance to the 
head of the department, unit or program.  If there is more than one student with a 
grievance on a particular matter, each student must submit a separate grievance.  The 
department, unit, or program head, or director or designated committee will issue a 
written decision on the grievance within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical.   
Graduate students who wish to appeal from the decision rendered at the department, 
unit or program level must submit a formal, written appeal to the Dean of the College 
within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of written notice of the decision by the 
department, unit, or program head, or director or designated committee.  The Dean may 
delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not 

104 
 
 
limited to one of the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted 
grievance committee who shall make a recommendation to the Dean.  The Dean shall 
render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical.  
Graduate students who wish to appeal the written decision of the Dean must submit a 
formal written appeal to the Provost within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the 
Dean's decision.  A copy of the appeal must also be submitted to the Vice Provost for 
Education and to the Dean.  The Provost may delegate review of the matter to another 
individual or committee, including but not limited to the Vice Provost for Education who 
shall make a recommendation to the Provost.  The Provost shall render a decision on the 
appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical.  Decisions by the Provost 
are final and not appealable.   
Summary of Levels of Appeal for General Grievances: 
• Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program 
• Formal review by the appropriate department, unit, or program head, or director or 
designated committee 
• Formal written appeal to the Dean  
• Formal written appeal to the Provost  
• Provost issues final non-appealable decision 
Taxation of Graduate Student Awards Policy 
I. Statement 
Graduate student awards given by the university may be subject to U.S. federal, state and 
local income (wage) taxes and required withholdings. This Policy explains the U.S. federal, 
state and local income (wage) taxation and withholding for graduate student awards given 
by the university. 
II. U.S. Federal Personal Income Tax (and Tax Status) 
a. U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents 
To fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats graduate student awards by the 
university in the form of scholarships, fellowships, teaching assistantships, research 
assistantships and stipends as being subject to U.S. federal personal income tax as 
follows: 

105 
 
 
• If a graduate student is not a degree candidate, all award funds are subject to tax. 
• If a graduate student is a degree candidate, the amount of any award used for tuition, 
fees and required books, supplies and equipment is not subject to tax. The amount 
used for other expenses such as room, board and travel is subject to tax. 
• If a graduate student incurs business and/or travel expenses on the university’s behalf 
and submits the expense reimbursement in compliance with the university’s Business 
and Travel Expense (BTE) Policy, these expenses are not subject to tax. 
• The part of any award that represents payment for the student's services such as 
teaching, research or other service (e.g., writing, administrative assistance, etc.) is 
subject to tax. 
In computing graduate student taxable income for purposes of required tax withholdings 
and any required informational returns, the university can determine centrally the part of 
a graduate student's award that covers tuition and required university fees, since the 
university publishes these costs. If departments submit to the HR Service Center a 
monthly award amount in addition to tuition and required fees, the entire additional 
amount is subject to tax. It is the graduate students’ responsibility to determine the 
portion of their award used for any additional required fees and expenses (e.g., books, 
supplies and equipment). 
The university excludes the amount of the graduate student's award used for tuition and 
required university fees from the amount of taxable income shown on the graduate 
student’s IRS Form W-2. 
Graduate students who have questions about the U.S. federal personal income tax 
consequences of their graduate student awards should consult their own personal tax 
advisor or refer to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 970, "Tax Benefits for 
Education." Non-resident alien graduate students may also wish to review the “Students 
and Apprentices” section of IRS Publication 901, "U.S. Tax Treaties." These IRS 
publications, and more information about U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at 
www.irs.gov. 
b. Foreign Students and Permanent Residents 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. citizens and permanent residents are 
considered residents, but foreign graduate students may be considered residents or non-
residents for tax purposes. Information on tax residency status may be found in IRS 
Publication 519, “U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.” Some foreign graduate students may benefit 
from specific tax treaties between the U.S. and their home countries. Information on tax 

106 
 
 
treaties is contained in IRS Publication 901, “U.S. Tax Treaties.” These IRS publications, and 
more information on U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at www.irs.gov. 
III. Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax 
The following applies only for those graduate students providing services within 
Pennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university 
location in another state as part of the degree requirements that state’s income tax may 
be withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. 
For purposes of Pennsylvania personal income tax and required withholdings, to fulfill its 
legal obligations, the university treats fellowship awards and stipends as taxable 
compensation for services if the recipient is required to apply his skill and training to 
advance research, creative work, or some other project or activity, unless the recipient is a 
candidate for a degree and the same activities are required of all candidates for that 
degree as a condition to receiving the degree. Thus, as long as the services rendered by a 
graduate student are a standard part of the degree requirements for all students in the 
student’s program, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from 
the student’s award/stipend. At the university, when graduate students are required to 
render services, those services are generally required to be rendered as a standard part 
of the degree requirements for the relevant degree program; as long as departments 
confirm that the services are required to be rendered as a standard part of the degree 
program, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from 
fellowship awards or stipends for students performing those services. 
Further information about Pennsylvania personal income taxes may be obtained by 
visiting the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue website. 
IV. City of Pittsburgh/Pittsburgh Public School District Earned Income Tax (Wage 
Tax) 
The following applies only for those graduate students providing services within 
Pennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university 
location in another state as part of the degree requirements that state’s income tax may 
be withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. 
To fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats compensation that is subject to the 
Pennsylvania personal income tax (and required Pennsylvania personal income tax 
withholdings) as compensation that is subject to the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh 
Public School District’s local earned income (wage) tax (EIT). Therefore, if an award is not 
considered by the university to be compensation for purposes of the Pennsylvania 

107 
 
 
personal income tax, it is not considered compensation for the EIT. As a result, the 
university does not withhold EIT from graduate students for fellowship awards and 
stipends that are not subject to Pennsylvania personal income tax withholding. 
Further information about the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Public School District EIT 
may be obtained by visiting the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Finance website. 
V. Assistance in Responding to Correspondence from Taxing Bodies 
Should a graduate student receive correspondence from the Pennsylvania Department of 
Revenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh (on behalf of itself and the Pittsburgh Public School 
District) erroneously seeking to tax some or all of a fellowship award or stipend that was 
paid to the student for services rendered in Pennsylvania, and required to be rendered as 
a standard part of the degree requirements for the student’s degree program, the 
graduate student's department should contact the HR Service Center to obtain a letter to 
complete on behalf of the graduate student citing the relevant Pennsylvania or EIT, as 
applicable, exclusion from tax. 
If requested, the HR Service Center will provide the tax year and income paid to the 
department, and the remaining information will be completed by the department before 
providing it to the graduate student. The letter should be sent by the graduate student to 
the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh, as the case may 
be. 
Temporary Emergency Closing of the University Policy 
Policy Statement 
Carnegie Mellon University has an important commitment to students, employees, 
parents, sponsors, benefactors and the community. Accordingly, the university will make 
every attempt to operate normally during severe weather or other emergencies. This 
includes holding classes, conducting research programs, and operating facilities and 
services. The university will attempt to operate normally unless such operation represents 
a clear threat to the health and safety of students, staff, faculty and visitors. 
In the event of severe weather or other emergencies, the Emergency Preparedness and 
Response Team will assess the situation and provide recommendations to university 
leadership as to whether the university can continue normal operations, if normal 
operations including in-person classes, meetings, events and student activities should be 
conducted remotely, or if normal operations should be suspended. In the event it is 
decided that all normal operations on campus need to be conducted remotely or 

108 
 
 
suspended, only the president (or the president's designated representative) has the 
authority to modify operations and/or close the university and to specify those persons or 
group of persons who are to refrain from coming to the Pittsburgh campus and/or who 
are free to leave work or class early. Staff members who provide essential services, such 
as certain members of Campus Operations (including Emergency Management, Facilities 
Management and Campus Services, Computing Services and University Police) and 
Student Affairs (including Dining Services, Housing Services, etc.) may be required to work. 
Standard Operations 
Unless the president announces the university is closed or government authorities 
require a closure, CMU faculty and staff are expected to carry out their work 
responsibilities. When the university is in session, faculty members are expected to meet 
their scheduled classes and other obligations. If a faculty member is unable to meet a 
scheduled class, they should notify their department head or supervisor and arrange for 
either a qualified substitute or some other manner to make up the course session and/or 
coverage of the necessary course material. 
If the university is open but an essential staff member is unable to come to campus 
because of severe weather or other emergency, they should notify their supervisor as 
soon as possible to make alternative work arrangements. 
Announcement of Closing 
As soon as the president or the designee determines that university operations must be 
modified or closed due to an emergency, announcements will be issued via Carnegie 
Mellon email and the university’s emergency alert system, as well as posted to the CMU 
homepage and the CMU Alert website. Media Relations staff may also inform local media 
organizations. 
Transfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment Policy 
Policy Statement 
The Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses, originally dated January 13, 1993, and 
approved by the Committee on Educational Programs and Student and Faculty Affairs 
states: 
"Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit 
through a cross-registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from 

109 
 
 
other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include 
information on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration 
program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All 
other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, 
but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, 
honors or QPA calculations.” (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; 
however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow 
this.) 
Definitions 
A Carnegie Mellon course is one conducted under Carnegie Mellon University regulations 
regarding course content and grading and taught by faculty under the supervision of a 
Carnegie Mellon academic unit. Courses taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty at a Carnegie 
Mellon campus and/or teaching location qualify.  
Courses that are part of the regular offerings of other universities do not qualify, unless 
faculty at the other universities receive appointments at Carnegie Mellon and handle 
Carnegie Mellon students under Carnegie Mellon academic regulations. 
Courses offered for cross-registration are those taken under the PCHE (Pittsburgh Council 
on Higher Education) agreement or under the Qatar Education City agreement. 
Only official and final college or university transcripts will be accepted for the awarding of 
transfer credit. Grade reports, letters and the like are not acceptable. It is the 
responsibility of the Office of Undergraduate Admission, graduate admissions committees 
or the University Registrar's Office to verify official transcripts. Official transcripts for the 
awarding of transfer credit will reside in the student's permanent university academic 
record in the University Registrar's Office. 
It is the responsibility of each academic department to review and establish transfer 
course credit for their degree-seeking students. 
Transfer Credit Evaluation Procedure 
Incoming Undergraduate First-Year and Transfer Students 
External applicants applying for transfer to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission 
of: 
• official transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission as part of the admission 
process, 

110 
 
 
• official, final transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission once they are 
admitted and prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon. 
As part of the admission process, Admission will verify the official final transcripts, and 
then send them to the appropriate academic unit responsible for college/department 
acceptance decisions. Each unit will be responsible for student's review of transfer credit 
and the establishment of transfer course credit for each individual student. 
Current Students 
Current Carnegie Mellon students taking courses at other accredited institutions (colleges 
and universities), during either summer semesters or as part of exchange programs or 
other departmentally approved programs, or while on leave from Carnegie Mellon, must 
arrange for the submission of official final transcripts to the University Registrar's Office. 
Upon receipt, the University Registrar's Office will verify these official transcripts and send 
a copy of the transcript to the appropriate academic unit responsible for that student's 
college/department transfer credit decisions. The official transcript will reside in the 
student's university academic folder in the University Registrar's Office. Each unit will be 
responsible for its students' transfer credit review and the establishment of transfer 
course credit for each individual student. Should a unit receive the official transcript, it 
must be sent immediately to the University Registrar's Office. 
Incoming Graduate Students 
External applicants applying for admission to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission 
of: 
• official transcripts to their graduate admission committee as part of the admission 
process,  
• official, final transcripts to their graduate admission committee once they are admitted 
and prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon. 
As part of the admission process, the graduate admission committee will verify the official 
final transcripts and retain these official documents as part of students' academic record. 
Each unit will be responsible for students' review of transfer credit and the establishment 
of transfer course credit for each individual student.

Tuition and Fees Adjustment Policy 
Application 
This policy applies to withdrawals and leaves of absence by all students (graduate, 
undergraduate, non-degree) for all semesters (Fall, Spring, Summer 1, Summer 2, Summer 
All). 
Official Date of Withdrawal/Leave of Absence 
For students who notify the University of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of 
absence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is the earliest of: 
• the date the student began the withdrawal or leave of absence process; 
• the date the student notified his or her home department; 
• the date the student notified the associate dean of his or her college; or 
• the date the student notified the dean of students. 
For students who do not notify the University of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of 
absence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is: 
• the midpoint of the semester; or 
• the last date the student attended an academically-related activity such as an exam, 
tutorial or study group, or the last day a student turned in a class assignment. 
Tuition Adjustment 
Students who withdraw or take a leave of absence before completing 60% of the semester 
will be charged tuition based on the number of days completed within the semester. This 
includes calendar days, class and non-class days, from the first day of classes to the last 
day of final exams. Breaks which last five days or longer, including the preceding and 
subsequent weekends, are not counted. Thanksgiving and Spring Break are not counted. 
There is no tuition adjustment after 60% of the semester is completed. 
The tuition adjustment schedule is available on The HUB website. No tuition is charged to 
a student who is administratively withdrawn. 
No tuition is charged to a student who is administratively withdrawn. 

112 
 
 
Housing, Meal Plan & Fee Adjustments 
Housing charges are adjusted daily, beginning on check-in day and ending on the last day 
of final exams for the semester. Holiday breaks are included. The Winter Break period is 
not included. 
Meal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed 
based upon actual use. There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee. 
Financial Aid Adjustment 
Federal and institutional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student 
earns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is 
completed. 
Student grants and non-federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the 
withdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds. 
Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy 
Policy Statement 
No undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help 
session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 
4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take 
place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. 
Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure 
This policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic 
programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co-
curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and 
artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since 
we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for 
the students. 
In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all 
courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In 
addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or 
study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must 
take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all 
university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. 

113 
 
 
As with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions. Any academic or artistic 
activities which you feel must be scheduled between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. must be 
cleared with the University Registrar. These requests must be in writing either as a memo 
or through email to CMURegistrar@andrew.cmu.edu. All requests must include the course 
relationship, intent for the requested meeting, and the reason why the meeting cannot be 
held either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. 
Any further clarification of this policy can be addressed to the Associate Vice President 
and Director of Enrollment Services. 
Withdrawal of a Degree Policy 
The university reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted 
should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in 
support of it had been falsified. In such a case the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon 
discovery of the falsification.

Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the University 
Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized assistance. 
Statute of Limitations 
There is no statute of limitations that precludes course instructors from acting on the discovery 
of alleged violations either during the semester of enrollment in the course in question or after 
the course has concluded including after the student(s) has graduated. 
Important Definitions 
• Academic Advisor: The individual designated in SIO/S3 as the primary major academic 
advisor. The Academic Advisor may be designated by the department to disseminate relevant 
correspondence related to academic disciplinary action within the department according to 
departmental procedure. 
• Academic Disciplinary Action: Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed for 
violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism, and 
unauthorized assistance.  
• Academic Integrity Liaison: Each department designates an individual who is trained by the 
Office of Community Standards and Integrity to provide guidance to course instructors in 
cases of alleged violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Absent a 
departmental designation, the associate dean of the college in which the course is housed is 
the default liaison for consultation purposes. 
• Course Failure: A grade of “R” as outlined in the University Policy on Grading. 
• Course Instructor: Any person responsible for the instruction or grading of a course at the 
university as documented in the Schedule of Classes. 
• Department Head: The university faculty or staff member who leads an academic 
department. In academic disciplinary cases in which the home department is an academic 
program, the program director is considered to be the department head. 
• Email: The official Carnegie Mellon University email address designated in the university 
directory. 

117 
 
 
• Moderator: The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates an Academic Review Board 
hearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community Standards and 
Integrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines. 
• Process Advisor: As a staff member in the Office of Community Standards and Integrity, the 
Process Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening an Academic Review Board. The 
Process Advisor schedules the hearing, assembles the hearing board, informs the involved 
parties of the procedures for the hearing, and manages other administrative tasks. 
• Student: Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon 
University at the time of the alleged violation. An individual is also considered to be a student 
if they have been accepted for admission to the university but are not currently matriculating. 
Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled but not taking classes 
due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other personal leave; students who 
were enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who demonstrate an intent to enroll by 
registering for courses; and students participating in study abroad programs.  Because there 
is no statute of limitations for academic integrity violations and proceedings can be 
commenced after a student has left the university or graduated, “student” also includes 
former students. 
• Student’s Home College: The college designated in SIO/S3 as the student’s department of 
enrollment. 
• Student’s Home Department: The department designated in SIO/S3 as the student’s 
department of enrollment. 
• Support Person: A person of the student’s choosing who accompanies the student during the 
Academic Review Board hearing. The support person does not participate in the proceedings 
but may advise the student and/or be present at a hearing. Registered support persons are 
not permitted to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings. 
Course-Level Review, Decision, and Action 
Incidents of alleged violations of the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity will be initially 
reviewed and adjudicated at the course level or the equivalent academic level for projects that 
involve research or creative inquiry. Investigations may be managed by the course instructor(s) 
or departmental designee. In all cases involving alleged violations of the University Policy on 
Academic Integrity, the following procedures apply: 

118 
 
 
Gathering Information 
1. 
Suspected violations should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe, ideally 
within one to two weeks of discovering the alleged violation. 
2. 
Instructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation(s) and provide 
the student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in person meeting or by phone or 
videoconference as circumstances warrant. 
3. 
Course instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, 
faculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation(s) under review. 
For example, someone may have observed the suspected incident or interacted directly 
with the involved student(s) before, during, or after the incident in question.  
4. 
When discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors 
should avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in 
order to determine responsibility. 
5. 
If a student does not respond to notification of an alleged violation(s) of the University 
Policy on Academic Integrity, the matter may be reviewed in their absence by the course 
instructor after a reasonable period of time. In these circumstances, the course 
instructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome. 
Determining Responsibility and Course-Level Action 
1. 
The course instructor will decide whether the suspected violation(s) occurred based on 
available evidence. At this stage, instructors are encouraged to consult with the 
department’s designated Academic Integrity Liaison, department/program head, the 
college dean’s office or the Office of Community Standards and Integrity regarding the 
nature of the suspected violation(s), the nature of the evidence related to the alleged 
violation(s), and the range of outcomes under consideration. 
2. 
When assessing responsibility for an academic integrity violation, the course instructor 
should apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the 
evidence means that the course instructor has determined that it is more likely than not 
that the student has violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity. 
3. 
If the course instructor concludes that the student is responsible for the alleged 
violation(s), the course instructor should determine an outcome. The most severe 
outcome that can be assessed at this level of review and action is course failure 

119 
 
 
although the instructors and/or department heads may recommend additional 
outcomes for consideration during second-level review, decision, and action. 
4. 
Students who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not drop 
or withdraw from the course in question. In rare circumstances, the course instructor 
may provide explicit approval to drop the course. Students who drop the course without 
the proper permission will be manually re-enrolled in the course and further outcomes 
may result. 
5. 
Students who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not 
change a course to P/NP (including the use of a voucher) 
Documenting and Reporting the Course-Level Decision 
1. 
After determining responsibility and outcomes for a violation(s), the instructor should 
immediately and in writing via email notify the involved student(s) of the decision. If 
found responsible, the rationale for the determination of responsibility should be 
included in that notification. The outcome(s) that the course instructor has assessed 
should be noted as well. Students should also be informed of the opportunity to request 
an appeal and the procedures for doing so. 
2. 
All documented violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity should be 
reported to the Office of Community Standards and Integrity upon completion of the 
investigation and student notification. Reports may be submitted using the Academic 
Integrity Reporting Form. 
3. 
A copy of the email communication to the student should be included with the report. 
Course instructors are also encouraged to submit all evidence and supporting 
documentation. 
4. 
Upon receipt of the violation report, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity 
will notify the following individuals of the course-level decision and action: 
• Head of the student’s home department 
• Associate dean of the student’s home college  
• Academic advisor for the student 
• Head of department in which the course is registered (if different from the student's 
department) 

120 
 
 
• Associate dean of the college in which the course is registered (if different from the 
student's college) 
5. 
Students will receive official notification that the report has been received from the 
Office of Community Standards and Integrity. The notification will include an invitation 
to meet with a process advisor in the Office of Community Standards to discuss the 
case, review the appeal process, and prepare for second-level review (if needed).  
6. 
In addition to the above notifications, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity 
will be responsible for coordinating all second-level review, decision, and action and 
documenting the violation in the student’s university conduct record consistent with the 
university policy on Student Conduct Records Retention and Reporting. 
Appeals of Course-Level Action 
When a student has received official notification of course-level action from the Office of 
Community Standards and Integrity, a student has seven calendar days to request an appeal of 
course-level action. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing via email to the Office of 
Community Standards and Integrity.  
The written appeal request must indicate whether the student is appealing the finding of 
responsibility, the outcome, or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an 
appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: 
• A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; 
• Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the 
course-level review; 
• Stated course-level outcome(s) of failure in the course(s) that was not commensurate with 
the violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found 
responsible; and 
• New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the course-level review, 
merits re-consideration of the final disposition. 
The vice president for student affairs or designee will review the written appeal request and 
determine whether, in their judgment, the appeal presents an appealable issue that warrants 
review by an Academic Review Board.  
In the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of 
the appeal. 

121 
 
 
Should the vice president for student affairs or designee determine that sufficient grounds exist 
for further review, the Academic Review Board will adjudicate the appeal in a hearing with the 
participation of the course instructor(s) or designee and the involved student, both of whom are 
required to participate in the proceedings. The purpose of the hearing will be to make a 
recommendation to the vice provost for education or designee as to whether the course 
instructor’s initial decision should be upheld, vacated or modified based on a preponderance of 
the evidence standard. A preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not 
that student violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity.  
The course instructor(s) will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not 
already submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level action and 
supporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. 
Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to 
board member review. 
Second-Level Review, Decision, and Action 
Second-level review is required in the following circumstances: 
• Cases in which a student has committed more than one violation of the University Policy on 
Academic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of Community Standards and 
Integrity. 
• Cases in which a course instructor/student’s department head or designee requests 
additional action beyond course failure. 
Multiple Violation Reports 
Second-level review is required in all cases in which a student has committed more than one 
violation of the University Policy on Academic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of 
Community Standards and Integrity. 
When more than one violation has been reported about a student, the Office of Community 
Standards and Integrity should notify the head of the student’s home department. The 
student’s department head or designee may recommend appropriate outcomes given 
multiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity and document that 
recommendation in writing via email to the student and the Office of Community Standards 
and Integrity. The departmental recommendation will then be reviewed by an Academic 
Review Board in a hearing. 

122 
 
 
If the student’s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, members 
of the Academic Review Board will recommend an outcome as part of their review in a 
hearing. If the student’s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, 
the student’s department head or designee should document that decision in writing via 
email to the student. 
The Academic Review Board will review the departmental recommendation (if advanced) in a 
hearing in which the involved student will be given the opportunity to participate. The 
student’s department head or designee and course instructors will also be given the 
opportunity to participate in the full review. If they opt not to attend the full hearing, they 
should be available to participate in the hearing as witnesses. The purpose of the hearing will 
be to determine whether additional university action beyond the course-level outcomes is 
warranted given multiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. 
In order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the student’s 
department head or designee and course instructors will be asked to provide all 
documentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the 
student documenting the course-level actions and supporting evidence related to the 
violations, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. Appropriate redaction will be 
made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to board member review. 
Requests for Additional Outcomes 
Second-level review is required in all cases in which a course instructor or a student’s home 
department requests additional action beyond course failure. 
In these circumstances, the course instructor/student’s department head or designee should 
notify the student in writing via email that additional outcomes are being requested given the 
severity of the policy violation. This notification may occur in the initial course-level action 
notification or in a subsequent communication.  
The Academic Review Board will adjudicate the request for additional outcomes in a hearing 
in which both the party who is requesting the action and the involved student will be given 
the opportunity to participate. The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether 
additional university action beyond course failure is warranted given the nature of the policy 
violation. 
In order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the course 
instructor will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already 
submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level action and 
supporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. 

123 
 
 
Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior 
to board member review. 
Academic Review Board 
The Academic Review Board has jurisdiction in the following cases: 
• Appeals of a course instructor’s course-level decision and action. 
• Cases in which a student has committed more than one violation of the University Policy on 
Academic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of Community Standards and 
Integrity. 
• Cases in which a course instructor/student’s department head or designee requests 
additional action beyond course failure. 
Composition of the Academic Review Board 
Each case presented to the Academic Review Board is heard by two student board members 
and three faculty board members. The board for any case must include at least one member 
from the college(s) represented by the parties. When possible, the board for any case must 
include at least one student member at the same degree level as the student who is 
appearing before the board. In addition, a trained moderator presides over the hearing.  
The faculty board members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards and 
Integrity in consultation with Faculty Senate. The student board members will be appointed 
by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in consultation with Undergraduate 
Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly following a selection process 
coordinated by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity. All appointees must 
complete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible to serve as board members. Once 
trained, board members may complete up to three years of service, and board members 
may be reappointed. 
Members participating in a given hearing will be selected from a list of eligible individuals 
based upon availability and disinterestedness in the case or parties following review by the 
student who is appearing before the Academic Review Board. The involved course 
instructor(s), department head or designee, and board members will also have the 
opportunity to note any potential conflicts of interest. The following circumstances would 
preclude participation as a board member in a given hearing: 

124 
 
 
• Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or the 
case(s) under review 
• Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case(s) 
Conduct of the Academic Review Board 
The university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all academic 
disciplinary actions. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following procedural 
protections. The following is a list of procedures that govern the Academic Review Board 
process: 
Hearing Preparation and Scheduling 
1. 
In advance of the hearing, the members of the Academic Review Board will be 
provided a pre-read packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the 
initial academic integrity violation report(s); any supporting documentation related to 
the violation(s); any departmental recommendations for outcomes (if applicable); and 
a written introduction from the student to the board. 
2. 
The student may submit a written introduction and up to three written letters of 
support by a date specified by the process advisor. Additional information that is 
relevant to the review including email correspondence and assignment 
documentation may be submitted by the student. This documentation will be 
included in the pre-read packet at the discretion of the process advisor. 
3. 
It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity to ensure 
that times set for hearings are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have 
been offered to both the student and course instructor(s) whenever appropriate. In 
turn, both the student and course instructors(s) will be expected to demonstrate 
good-faith efforts in their participation with this process, particularly in relation to the 
scheduling of the hearing. If a case involves exigent circumstances that prevent the 
student or course instructor(s) from participating in a scheduled hearing, the hearing 
will be rescheduled. 
4. 
Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts with a student’s class schedule when 
identifying a hearing date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom 
attendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reasonable excuse for 
delaying a hearing. 

125 
 
 
Hearing Process and Procedures 
1. 
Information provided during an Academic Review Board hearing must be kept 
confidential by all parties. The student is provided a full copy of all materials provided 
to the hearing board for the purpose of preparing for or use during the hearing, 
consistent with the privacy rights of those involved. These materials are to be kept 
confidential and may be shared only with permission from the process advisor. 
These documents may not be duplicated nor utilized for any other purpose. All 
materials provided to the student must be returned to the process advisor at the 
conclusion of the hearing. 
2. 
In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted 
on the day of the hearing, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other 
evidence as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Evidence offered as 
rebuttal will be accepted only at the discretion of the moderator. 
3. 
Prior to the hearing, the student, course instructor(s), department head or designee 
who are participating in the review will be asked if they believe that the potential 
hearing board members are biased for or against them. If a perceived bias is 
reasonable, replacements will be chosen for the board and the hearing will be 
rescheduled. 
4. 
The student has the right to have one person of their choosing present at the 
hearing. The student is required to notify the process advisor of their support person 
of choice at a date specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days 
in advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, the hearing group may 
determine that it wishes to secure legal advice in connection with the hearing. Legal 
counsel or any other support person, if present, will not be permitted to participate 
in the proceedings but may advise the student and/or be present at a hearing. In the 
event that one party to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance 
notice, a hearing may be postponed until all parties to the case have had an 
opportunity to have counsel present. Registered support persons are not permitted 
to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings. 
5. 
Witnesses may be registered for each Academic Review Board hearing by the 
student, course instructor(s), and department head. Witnesses should be able to 
provide direct information related to the case(s) under review by the Academic 
Review Board, such as direct observation of the incident(s) in question and/or direct 
interaction with any of the parties before, during or after the incident in question. All 

126 
 
 
parties are required to notify the process advisor of their registered witnesses at a 
date specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days in advance of 
the Academic Review Board hearing.. 
6. 
In scheduling a hearing, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses 
significant to the case being heard are available to the hearing group. If a witness is 
not available to be called by the hearing group in person or via telecommunication, 
they may submit a written statement to the process advisor to be reviewed if the 
board requests information from the witness. Except in documented extenuating 
circumstances, students are expected to make a good-faith effort to provide 
information to the Academic Review Board when called as a witness. 
7. 
It is within the discretion of the board to determine whether they wish to hear from 
suggested witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the hearing 
group and subsequently dismissed. They should be present in the room only when 
providing information to the board.  
8. 
All proceedings, except the deliberation of the board members, will be recorded. 
Recordings will be kept in accordance with student conduct records retention 
practices. 
9. 
During the actual hearing, the student has the right to be present during 
presentation of evidence. 
10. Students and course instructors who are participating in a hearing will be limited to 
ten minutes for their introduction and five minutes to provide a summary following 
the presentation of evidence. 
11. The majority of the proceeding will consist of questioning from the board members 
for all parties as well as registered witnesses. Students and course instructors will 
also have the opportunity to present questions for the board’s consideration. 
12. Following each summary, the board will enter closed deliberations.  
13. In cases that involve appeals of course-level action, no information about the 
student's prior violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity will be shared 
with the Academic Review Board. If the student has prior violations on record and 
the course-level action is upheld on appeal, the student may be recalled before the 
board to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the Academic Review 
Board making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case. 

127 
 
 
Hearing Outcome Determination and Notifications 
1. 
A representative of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity will be 
responsible for notifying the vice provost for education or designee in writing of the 
recommendation of the hearing group. 
2. 
The vice provost for education or designee makes the decision in the case, informed 
by the recommendation of the Academic Review Board.  The vice provost for 
education or designee may accept, reject or modify the recommendation, or may 
remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review. 
3. 
After reviewing the recommendations and rendering a decision, the vice provost for 
education or designee will notify the student in writing of their decision. 
4. 
The Office of Community Standards and Integrity will send a copy of the final 
decision letter to the following individuals: 
• Course instructor(s) 
• Head of the student's home department 
• Associate dean of the student's home college  
• Academic advisor for the student 
• Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the 
student's department) 
• Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different from 
the student's college) 
5. 
Parents of a student will not be notified of any academic disciplinary action, except as 
permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 
6. 
Academic disciplinary actions will be recorded in the student's disciplinary record in 
the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in accordance with student conduct 
records retention practices. When academic disciplinary actions affect eligibility for 
enrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Academic 
disciplinary records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the 
academic record of a student.

Appeals of Academic Review Board Decisions 
A student may appeal a decision delivered by the vice provost for education or designee 
following the Academic Review Board process by submitting a request for appeal in writing via 
email to the provost of the university  within seven calendar days of the official notification of 
the decision.  
In cases in which the Academic Review Board decision pertains to an appeal of course-level 
action, the course instructor may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the 
university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision. In cases in which 
the Academic Review Board decision pertains to matters that involve multiple violation reports 
or requests for additional outcomes, the course instructor and/or student’s department head or 
designee may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the university within seven 
calendar days of the official notification of the decision. 
The written appeal request should indicate whether the appeal concerns the finding(s) of 
responsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an 
appeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases: 
• A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; 
• The outcomes imposed during the second-level review were not commensurate with the 
violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found 
responsible; 
• Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the 
course-level action appeal review or second-level review; 
• New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing, merits re-
consideration of the final disposition. 
The appeal officer designated by the provost will review the written appeal request and 
determine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, the appeal presents an appealable 
issue that warrants review by the appeal officer. In hearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their 
discretion, may meet with individuals and review information relevant to the basis of the appeal.  
In the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of 
the appeal. 
Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While 
an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the student, course instructor, and 
department head as necessary about the anticipated timeline.  

129 
 
 
The appeal officer will require that the dean of the student’s college review the case and provide 
input on the final disposition. 
The appeal officer has the authority to accept, vacate or modify the decision as they deem 
appropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed.  The appeal officer may reconvene the 
initial Academic Review Board or remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for 
review. 
Outcomes 
The academic disciplinary action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions 
that may be imposed during second-level review. One or more of these actions may be imposed 
in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be 
imposed as appropriate. 
Non-compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Review Board 
process. 
The determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of 
the community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and 
any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. 
Outcomes related to student standing 
These outcomes clarify the student's standing with the University. Additional violations of the 
Academic Integrity policy may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the 
University. 
• Disciplinary Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a 
designated period of time. Probation may entail specific requirements to be met. When a 
student is on disciplinary probation, they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in 
the event of further academic disciplinary action. 
• Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated 
period of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves 
from the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, 
and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the 
campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on 
Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on academic disciplinary suspension 
is not eligible for student employment by the university during the period of suspension. 

130 
 
 
• Drop from Academic Program: The student is required to sever entirely their connection 
with the academic program in which they are currently enrolled. Students who have been 
dropped from an academic program may apply for admission to other academic 
programs at the university. 
• Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the university. 
Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from the campus 
(including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) 
within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off of the campus 
permanently, unless otherwise specified. Students who have been expelled from the 
university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the university. 
• Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to 
facilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. 
Restorative Outcomes 
These outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused 
or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. 
Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional 
academic disciplinary action. 
• Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The university may require a student to 
meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified 
time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant 
assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s), 
such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is also expected to 
provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this 
outcome. 
• Community Service: The university may require uncompensated service (a specified 
number of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an 
outcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre-approved by the process 
advisor. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed 
community service.  
• Educational/Developmental Assignment: The university may require a student to 
complete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and 
development. These assignments are determined by the Academic Review Board and 

131 
 
 
completion is monitored by the process advisor. Assignments may include but are not 
limited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an 
individual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. 
Withholding a Degree 
Because a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic 
requirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a 
member of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree 
not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the resolution of 
academic disciplinary action proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. 
Academic Disciplinary Actions Retention and Reporting 
Records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are confidential and are not released 
without the consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law 
or court order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of academic disciplinary actions 
proceedings are retained for three years after final separation of the student from the 
university. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be 
separated for three continuous years. If a student reenrolls in any student program within three 
years, the calculation of the final separation date will reset. 
Consistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of academic disciplinary actions 
record checks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization 
as necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) 
provided the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. 
The file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student 
separates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a 
pending Academic Integrity violation. 
Records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a 
student from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. 
Case-specific questions regarding timeframes for academic disciplinary actions records 
retention and reporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity.

Activities 
Extracurricular activities involving the students at Carnegie Mellon are under the direction of 
Student Government, the Division of Student Affairs, or particular university departments, 
committees and councils advisory to the officers of the university. In general, students are 
charged with exercising a high level of self-governance related to extracurricular activities 
and, toward that end, are encouraged to form organizations that serve their extracurricular 
needs and qualify for recognition and/or funding by Student Government. 
 
Financial statements of all organizations or committees that collect money, in any manner, 
from the student body must be available to Student Government if requested. Publication in 
The Tartan of a statement of the accounts may be required at the option of Student 
Government. 
Eligibility 
Extracurricular activities are any campus social, cultural, service or honorary organization; 
varsity, club or intramural athletic team; or any other campus organization recognized by 
Student Government or by the university whether participation is on the intercollegiate 
level or within the university. Students who meet the criteria outlined in the Student 
Activities Fee policy will be assessed the Student Activities Fee by Enrollment Services, and 
will be eligible to participate in extracurricular activities upon paying the fee. Enrolled 
students who seek to participate in extracurricular activities but who are not automatically 
assessed the Student Activities Fee must pay the relevant semester(s) fee prior to 
participation. 
Active Medical Assistance Protocol (AMAP) 
The university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an 
environment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another. To that 
end, the active medical assistance protocol (AMAP) sets forth an expectation that community 
members take responsible action when the health or safety of a student is compromised due 
to overuse or abuse of alcohol or illicit substances and/or as a result of hazing activity. 

136 
 
 
Amnesty from university disciplinary action and University Police action will be granted to the 
student(s) for whom medical assistance is summoned and for those seeking assistance from 
emergency services personnel[18] when all of the following conditions apply: 
1. 
An individual contacted emergency services personnel based on a reasonable belief that 
another individual was in need of immediate medical attention, which had not otherwise 
been sought, to prevent death or serious bodily injury; 
2. 
The individual seeking assistance provided their own name to the emergency services 
personnel; and 
3. 
The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in need 
of medical assistance until emergency services personnel arrived and the need for the 
concerned individual's presence had ended.  
Those seeking assistance will be assured that the university will likewise not pursue further 
university action against any individual or organization involved in such an incident when 
appropriate medical attention is sought. Students who are directly involved in attending to 
the compromised student until help arrives will also be granted amnesty from university 
action. Students involved in an incident for which amnesty is granted will be provided 
appropriate educational or developmental interventions.  
In cases where help is indicated but not sought, the most severe disciplinary action will be 
taken against all students involved. 
This protocol extends the university’s previously established Alcohol Medical Assistance 
Protocol (1999) and is consistent with the spirit of several Pennsylvania laws that include safe 
harbor provisions granting immunity from criminal prosecution for seeking medical 
assistance.

Advertising on Campus – Graffiti and Poster Policy of Student 
Government 
In order to more effectively communicate when events and programs are happening on 
campus, the following Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy was established 
(revised April 20, 2010). The following is a summary of the policy which can be found in its 
entirety on the Student Government Policies page. 
Purpose and Scope of Policy 
Carnegie Mellon University is a community where many different opportunities are 
available outside the classroom. As a result, groups compete for the use of effective 
advertising space on campus. The Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy helps to 
regulate the use of advertising space on Carnegie Mellon University's Pittsburgh campus. 
Noting the Use of Student Activities Fees 
If one hundred (100) percent of the budget for a student organization, activity or event is 
financed by the Activities Fee, then all advertising and printed material associated with 
that organization, activity or event must include the phrase "Funded by your Student 
Activities Fee". 
 
If the Activities Fee finances a portion of the budget for a student organization, activity or 
event, but less than one hundred (100) percent of that budget, then all advertising and 
printed material associated with that organization, activity or event must include either 
the phrase "Funded in part by your Student Activities Fee", or "Funded by your Student 
Activities Fee". 
Graffiti 
Graffiti is not a permissible form of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University's campus. 
Graffiti is defined as any defacement of Carnegie Mellon University property, the 
defacement of posters hung on campus bulletin boards, and/or the use of drawings or 
messages in a public space that are libelous in nature or violate the Carnegie Mellon 
Code. Graffiti is distinguished from painting the fence and chalking on Carnegie Mellon 
University sidewalks. Permissible forms of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University's 
campus include chalking, painting the fence and distributing posters and banners. 

143 
 
 
Chalking 
Chalking is only permitted on sidewalks. Chalking is not permitted in areas that are not 
directly exposed to rainfall, including covered sidewalks and vertical portions of outdoor 
stairs. Chalking of this sort is a form of graffiti. The sidewalk chalk used for chalking must 
be water-soluble and must be removable by the natural elements. Products such as spray 
chalk, washable crayons, and other semi-permanent products deemed not removable by 
the natural elements are considered a form of graffiti. 
Painting the Fence 
Painting the Fence, a long standing tradition at Carnegie Mellon University, is not 
considered graffiti so long as only paintbrushes are used. The use of spray paint, 
airbrushes, paint rollers, and similar tools to paint the Fence is a form of graffiti. While 
painting the Fence, all painting materials must be kept within the gravel area surrounding 
the Fence. Painting anything other than the Fence is a form of graffiti. 
Posters 
Carnegie Mellon University recognized groups, organizations, academic and 
administrative departments, and students are only permitted to post active posters on 
the Student Government bulletin board. Posters are not permitted on doors, walls, and/or 
windows at Carnegie Mellon University. Locations of permitted bulletin boards can be 
found on the Student Government website. Posters must meet the following criteria: 
• The posted items do not exceed a size of 11" x 17"; 
• The name and contact information of the sponsoring Carnegie Mellon University 
recognized group, organization, department, or member of the campus community is 
clearly indicated on the poster, unless that poster has been registered with the Graffiti 
and Poster Policy Administrator via the Student Senate Campus Life Committee and/or 
the Graduate Student Assembly Vice President of Campus Affairs;

Alcohol and Drug Policy 
I. Policy Statement 
Carnegie Mellon University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy community 
that supports the academic mission of the institution. In keeping with this commitment, 
the university permits the use of alcohol or drugs within its community only in a manner 
that is legal, responsible, and consistent with the expectations outlined in this policy. 
Further, the university makes available information and resources so that its community 
members are positioned to assist anyone whose personal well-being may be negatively 
impacted due to misuse of alcohol or drugs. 
This policy applies to all members of the university community, including all faculty, staff 
and students. This policy also applies to contractors, volunteers and visitors while on 

145 
 
 
university property (whether owned or leased) or while being paid or reimbursed with 
university funds. This policy focuses on compliance with laws in the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, as a global university with operations 
throughout the world, Carnegie Mellon is equally committed to compliance with all 
applicable alcohol and drug laws in all jurisdictions in which the university operates. 
II. Policy on Illegal Drugs 
The unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of drugs is prohibited at 
the university. This prohibition applies to the unlawful possession, distribution, sale, or 
use of illegal narcotics, prescription drugs, and other illegal drugs. It is a violation of this 
policy for prescription drugs to be provided to or used by someone other than the person 
for whom they were prescribed. It is also a violation of this policy for prescription drugs to 
be used in a manner for which they were not prescribed. 
The university complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The U.S. federal 
Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 requires institutions of higher education 
that receive federal funds to comply with U.S. federal drug laws. Although some state and 
local governments have legalized the use of various forms of marijuana, federal law 
continues to prohibit the manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of marijuana. 
As such, in accordance with U.S. federal law, all forms of marijuana, including prescription 
medical marijuana, are prohibited on all university property (whether owned or leased) 
and in connection with all university programs. 
Faculty, staff, and student-workers are prohibited from being under the influence of any 
drugs (including prescription drugs) that cause impairment and impact the ability of 
employees to perform their jobs. University employees with a license to operate 
specialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver’s license or pilot’s license) must 
follow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of drugs before and/or while operating the 
vehicle/equipment. 
III. Policy on Alcohol 
The unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of alcohol is prohibited at 
the university. 
All members of the university community are expected to comply with applicable laws 
regarding the possession, consumption, transportation, and distribution of alcohol. 
Except as set forth below or as otherwise prohibited by applicable departmental-level 
rules, the lawful consumption of alcoholic beverages on university property (whether 
owned or leased) and/or in connection with university programs by individuals of legal 

146 
 
 
drinking age (21 years or older in United States) is permitted by the university. In these 
circumstances, however, the university expects faculty, staff, students, contractors and all 
other visitors to conduct themselves, both individually and collectively, in a responsible 
manner and in compliance with this policy. 
The consumption of alcohol and/or the possession of open containers of alcohol are 
prohibited (i) while outdoors on university property, (ii) while inside university facilities in 
common areas, theaters, galleries, dining facilities, or other spaces that are accessible by 
the public, (iii) while in classrooms, labs, studios, or other instructional spaces when a 
course is in session, and (iv) at all on-campus athletic facilities. However, alcohol may be 
served and consumed in these locations where permitted under Section IV of this policy 
concerning Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration.  
All university employees, including faculty, staff, and student-workers, are expected to 
observe the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct. Faculty, staff and 
student-workers who are of legal drinking age who choose to engage in the consumption 
of alcohol are expected to do so responsibly. Faculty, staff, and student-workers are 
prohibited from working while intoxicated or impaired. Furthermore, faculty, staff, and 
student-workers are prohibited from consuming alcohol in a manner that in any way 
impairs the performance of job duties, endangers the physical well-being of oneself or 
others, or could result in the damage of property (in most circumstances, employees are 
to refrain from consuming alcohol when performing their normal academic, 
administrative, technical, or professional duties). University employees with a license to 
operate specialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver’s license or pilot’s 
license, etc.) must follow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of alcohol before and/or 
while operating the vehicle/equipment. 
Sale of Alcohol 
In all cases, Carnegie Mellon complies with the law of the applicable jurisdiction regarding 
the sale of alcohol.  Under Pennsylvania law, a liquor license is required to sell 
alcohol.  The university does not possess a liquor license.  As such, alcohol may not be 
directly or indirectly sold in connection with any university program or activity in 
Pennsylvania unless the alcohol is sold and/or served by a third-party that possesses a 
valid liquor license and, if necessary, an off-premises catering permit.  The indirect sale of 
alcohol includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
• The sale of tickets, entrances fees, or required donations to attend an event where 
alcohol is served; and 

147 
 
 
• The use of drink tickets in connection with paid admission to an event where alcohol is 
served. 
IV. Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration 
A “University Event with Alcohol” is a university event where alcohol will be served either 
(1) on campus, or (2) off-campus where the alcohol is paid for directly, in whole or in part, 
with University funds, or where reimbursement, in whole or in part, is made for the 
purchase of alcohol using University funds.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following 
activities are not University Events with Alcohol for purposes of Social Host and 
registration requirements (however, the other provisions of this Alcohol and Drug Policy 
still apply): 
i. consumption of alcohol by students of legal drinking age in an on-campus private 
residence; 
ii. consumption of alcohol in an on-campus private residence that is leased, rented or 
otherwise occupied by an employee of the university, where no students are expected 
and/or permitted to attend (excluding students who are relatives of the employee); 
iii. consumption of alcohol in a Private Office with a door and lock that is occupied by no 
more than four (4) faculty and/or staff members and where no students are present, 
and 
iv. any events registered through the process that fraternities and/or sororities are 
required to use in order to host an event with alcohol. 
As detailed in the Social Host & Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf], a University 
Event with Alcohol must be registered with and approved in advance by the Office of the 
Dean of Students, and at least one Social Host must be designated for the University 
Event with Alcohol. These procedures set forth the requirements for University Events 
with Alcohol, the requirements for Social Hosts, and the types of events exempt from 
these requirements. 
The Social Host for each University Event with Alcohol is responsible for (1) ensuring that 
alcohol is served only to individuals who are of legal drinking age (2) ensuring that 
individuals who are visibly intoxicated are not served alcohol, and (3) oversight of the 
event consistent with the Social Host Responsibility Guidelines set forth in the Social Host 
& Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf]. 

148 
 
 
The university will provide a legal defense and/or indemnity to any individual who serves 
as a Social Host of a University Event with Alcohol, pursuant to the Social Host & Alcohol 
Event Registration Procedures [pdf], and subject to the attached Terms and Conditions for 
Social Host Defense and Indemnity [pdf]. 
The rights of faculty and Trustees and Officers of the University who serve as Social Hosts 
are not governed by the Terms and Conditions for Social Host Defense and Indemnity 
[pdf]. Rather, faculty defense and indemnity rights continue to be governed by Article VIII 
of the University By-Laws concerning Professional Protection Regarding Faculty Members. 
Defense and indemnity rights of Trustees and Officers of the University continue to be 
governed by Article IX of the University By-Laws concerning Liability and Indemnification 
of Trustees and Officers. 
V. Sanctions & Medical Amnesty 
Faculty, staff, and students who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up 
to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Visitors to the 
university who violate this policy may be removed from university property and university 
events. Individuals who violate this policy may also be referred for criminal prosecution, 
though criminal charges are not a prerequisite for sanctions under this policy. Information 
regarding the state and federal criminal penalties for violations of drug and alcohol laws, 
as well as information regarding the health risks associated with the use of drugs and 
alcohol, is available in the University’s annual Alcohol and Drug Brochure [pdf]. 
The university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an 
environment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another.  As 
specified in the Active Medical Assistance Protocol students will be granted amnesty from 
university disciplinary action and University Police action when assistance from 
emergency services personnel is appropriately sought for individuals in need of 
immediate medical attention due to alcohol or drug use. In the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, similar amnesty from criminal prosecution is also available to individuals 
pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308.1 and 35 P.S. § 780-113.7. 
VI. Resources 
The university provides the following resources to individuals seeking assistance relating 
to the abuse of alcohol or drugs. 

149 
 
 
• Counseling & Psychological Services — Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is 
available as a resource to students for initial assessment of drug and alcohol use, and 
referrals to off campus outpatient and inpatient treatment programs. 
• University Health Services — University Health Services (UHS) also provides students 
with initial assessment of drug and alcohol use and referrals to CaPS or off-campus 
treatment programs, in addition to substance abuse prevention education, through its 
Office of Health Promotion. Individual sessions are offered alongside online programs 
to assist students in assessing their own usage patterns and reducing the risks 
associated with substance abuse. UHS also facilitates the Collegiate Recovery 
Community at the university to support and connect students and their allies who are 
choosing sobriety. Information about appropriate community support groups is 
available through CaPS and UHS. Some of the support programs available in the 
Pittsburgh area include: Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Al-Anon and 
the Adult Children of Alcoholics Network of Greater Pittsburgh. 
• Employee Assistance Program — Carnegie Mellon has established an Employee 
Assistance Program (EAP), sponsored and paid for by the university, to facilitate 
employees' efforts to resolve problems that can affect job performance and general 
well-being.  EAP services include counseling and support relating to substance abuse. 
Broadcasting 
All students who participate in commercial, off-campus television or radio broadcasts, 
webcasts or podcasts and use the Carnegie Mellon name should consult with the Media 
Relations Department. These students should contact Media Relations at 412-268-2900 prior 
to their participation. 
Code of Business Ethics and Conduct Policy 
Authority 
Carnegie Mellon University has various well-established policies and principles (some of 
which are referenced throughout this Code of Business Ethics and Conduct) which apply 
to different aspects of the University’s business and operations. As a result of the recent 
enactment of various federal regulations, it has become necessary to re-state some of 
these various policies and principles into one Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. 

150 
 
 
Applicability 
This Code applies to individuals who are paid by the University when they are working for 
the University, including faculty, staff and students when working for the University. These 
individuals are referred to in this Code as “members of the University community.”[19] 
Introduction and Purpose 
The University’s mission to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research 
and creative inquiry, teaching, and learning requires all members of the University 
community to maintain the highest ethical and professional standards in all domains. 
Accordingly, all members of the University community are expected to honor this Code 
when working for the University. 
This Code reflects the University’s well-established policies and principles governing the 
behavior of all members of the University community when working for the University, 
and is intended to function as a useful summary of ethical principles and to emphasize 
the importance of observing these principles. As such, this Code draws on the ethical and 
behavioral standards set forth in many separate University policies and principles as well 
as applicable laws. This Code supplements but does not supplant other applicable 
University policies and principles including, but not limited to, official University Policies, 
the Faculty Handbook and the Staff Handbook. 
Code of Business Ethics and Conduct 
a) Ethical and Professional Conduct. All members of the University community are 
expected to observe the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct, and to 
conduct all business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, 
accuracy, integrity and respect for others. The foregoing includes the requirement for 
all members of the University community engaged in research activities to engage in 
the responsible conduct of research, and prohibits those members from engaging in 
research misconduct, including fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in proposing, 
performing or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. 
All members of the University community are also expected to act with due recognition 
of their position of trust and loyalty with respect to the University, and its students, 
research sponsors and donors. When in doubt about the propriety of a proposed 
course of action, a member of the University community should seek counsel from 
 
19 As required by agreement with the United States Department of Defense, the University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) 
has a separate Code of Business Ethics and Compliance that contains additional requirement for SEI employees. 

151 
 
 
colleagues, supervisors or University administrators who can assist in determining the 
right and appropriate course.  
Existing University policies and principles on ethical and professional conduct include: 
• Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research Policy 
• Faculty Handbook: Statement on Academic Integrity 
• Staff Handbook, Section II. 1: Employment Policies and Procedures - Our Expectations 
[pdf] 
• Human Subjects in Research Policy 
• Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance 
b) Respect for Others. The University embraces diversity as a core value and is committed 
to establishing a campus culture that reflects a fundamental respect for different ways 
of living, working and learning. The University also is committed to the principle of 
non-discrimination, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of 
race, color, national origin, sex, handicap, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, age, veteran 
status, sexual orientation or gender identity.  
Existing University policies and principles involving respect for others include: 
• Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Policy 
• Disorderly Conduct Policy 
• Freedom of Expression Policy 
• Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) 
• Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy 
• Workplace Threats and Violence Policy 
• Riotous and Disorderly Behavior Policy 
c) Conflicts of Interest and Commitment. A conflict of interest occurs when a member of 
the University community is in a position to influence a decision on policy or purchases 
where he or she might directly or indirectly receive financial benefit or give improper 
advantage to associates. A conflict of commitment arises when a member of the 
University community's involvement in outside activities substantially interferes with 
his or her commitment to the University. All members of the University community 
should use good judgment, professional commitment and ethics to protect themselves 

152 
 
 
and the University from potential conflicts of interest or commitment. A member of 
the University community with a potential conflict must, if the potential conflict 
involves research activities, disclose as and when required by the University's Research 
Compliance Office, and for other activities, should discuss and document the potential 
conflict with the member's supervisor or University administrators who can assist in 
determining the right and appropriate course.  
Existing University policies and principles involving conflicts of interest and 
commitment include: 
• Policy on Consulting by Faculty 
• Policy on Special Service Payments for Internal Consulting 
• Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment 
• Office of Sponsored Projects - Conflict of Interest  
d) Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The University is subject to numerous laws 
and regulations that govern the various activities of the University as an employer, 
government contractor and institution of higher education. All members of the 
University community are expected to familiarize themselves with the federal, state 
and local laws and regulations that apply to their activities and conduct themselves in 
compliance with such laws and regulations. Noncompliance, even when inadvertent, 
can have severe consequences to the members involved and the University, including 
civil liability, loss of funding, reputational harm and, in extreme cases, criminal 
prosecution or sanctions. Questions about the interpretation or applicability of law or 
regulations should be directed to the University's Office of the General Counsel. 
e) Compliance with Policies and Procedures. All members of the University community 
are expected to familiarize themselves with and follow applicable University policies 
and procedures. As part of this, each member of the University community also is 
expected to follow the policies and procedures enacted by the academic or 
administrative unit within which the member is working at the University. Questions 
about a specific policy or procedure should be directed to the individual or office 
responsible for oversight of that policy or procedure. Existing University policies and 
procedures include.  
Existing University policies and procedures include: 
• Carnegie Mellon University Policies 

153 
 
 
• Faculty Handbook 
• Staff Handbook [pdf] 
• Human Subjects in Research Policy 
f) Authority to Commit the University and Compliance with Agreements. In the ordinary 
course of its business of education and research, the University enters into various 
agreements, such as contracts, grants, licenses, gifts, purchase orders and other 
binding obligations, from federal and non-federal sources. Entering into an agreement 
by the University, including sponsored research funding, creates a legal obligation on 
the part of the University to comply with the terms and conditions of that agreement, 
including applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have 
authority delegated by an appropriate University official are authorized to enter into 
agreements on behalf of the University.  
All members of the University community are expected to act in good faith and adhere 
to all agreements and other binding obligations undertaken by the University. In 
particular, members of the University community involved in federally-sponsored 
research activities must strictly adhere to all contractual obligations (including 
adhering to applicable federal laws and regulations) related to those activities.  
Existing University policies and principles involving authority to commit the University 
and compliance with agreements include: 
• Signature Authority for Legally Binding Commitments and Documents 
• Research Proposals: Government, Corporations and Foundations Policy 
• Sponsored Research Policies and Procedures 
g) Appropriate Treatment of Confidential and Private Information. Members of the 
University community may have access to confidential, proprietary or private 
information of various types, including student records, employee records, University 
business information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property and 
other information subject to contractual or legal obligations of confidentiality. All 
members of the University community must follow all applicable legal, contractual and 
policy restrictions on the use, disclosure and safeguarding of such information.  
Existing University policies and principles involving appropriate treatment of 
confidential information include: 
• Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Information Security Program 

154 
 
 
• HIPAA Policy 
• Information Security Policy 
• Policy on Privacy of Faculty Offices 
• Student Privacy Rights Policy 
h) Appropriate Use of University Resources and Accurate Financial Reporting. University 
resources are reserved for University business purposes. Therefore, all members of 
the University community are expected to ensure that University resources, such as 
funds and other property are used appropriately for the benefit of the University and 
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and University policies and 
procedures. When required by their job responsibilities, members of the University 
community must record, allocate, document and/or report revenue, expenditures, 
time, effort and other information in an accurate, complete and timely manner. All 
entries in University's books and records, including departmental accounts and 
individual expense reporting, must accurately reflect each transaction.  
Existing University policies and principles involving appropriate use of University 
resources and accurate financial reporting include: 
• Computing Policy 
• Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Programs 
• Intellectual Property Policy 
• Property Management Policies and Procedures 
• Business and Travel Expense Reimbursement Policy 
• Petty Cash Policy 
• Policy for Auxiliary and Recharge Service Centers 
• Policy for Directly Charging Administrative Costs to Sponsored Research 
• Purchasing Policy 
• Responsibilities for Managing Carnegie Mellon University Financial Assets 
• Separation of Individual’s and Institution’s Interests 
i) Reporting Suspected Violations. Each member of the University community has the 
responsibility to ask questions, seek guidance and report suspected violations of this 
Code or any other applicable law or regulation, contractual or other obligation of the 

155 
 
 
University or of University policy or procedure. Individuals are encouraged to report 
suspected violations through standard management channels, such as to their 
immediate supervisor or other appropriate University officials. However, an individual 
who for any reason feels uncomfortable reporting a suspected violation through 
established channels may file an anonymous report through the University's Ethics 
Reporting Hotline: 
CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY ETHICS REPORTING HOTLINE 
TOLL FREE: 844-587-0793  
Via the Internet: cmu.ethicspoint.com 
Reports of suspected violations may be made confidentially, and even anonymously, 
although the more information that is given, the easier it is to investigate the reports. A 
report of a suspected violation is a service to the University and will not in itself jeopardize 
employment with the University. That is, no person who makes a good faith report of a 
suspected violation will be reprimanded or retaliated against in any way. 
j) Consequences of Violations. Violations of this Code or any other applicable law or 
regulation, contractual or other obligation of the University or University policy or 
procedure may carry disciplinary or other consequences, including dismissal. 
Concessions, Solicitations, Lotteries & Raffles 
Concessions 
Any group or individual who wishes to sell merchandise or service of any description on 
the campus or in the buildings of the institution must present an application in writing to 
the dean of students. Written permits will be issued for approved applications. 
Solicitation of Funds 
Student organizations may solicit funds for use by the organization from students, alumni, 
family or friends. Funds solicited using the University’s name or for which the donor 
expects to receive a charitable income tax deduction as a gift to the University must be 
solicited and used in compliance with the University’s solicitation and accounting rules. To 
ensure compliance with tax laws, these rules require gifts designated to a specific 
organization be made through the University’s annual giving website or by deposit to the 
Office of Student Leadership, Involvement and Civic Engagement. 

156 
 
 
Lotteries and Raffles 
Lotteries, raffles or other devices of a like nature are governed by the laws of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and are therefore authorized on campus only when 
required permits are obtained by the appropriate governing authority. Approval to host 
an event deploying games of chance must receive approval from the director of student 
leadership, involvement and civic engagement to ensure compliance with the law. 
Deadly Weapons Policy 
Objectives 
This Policy is part of a broad initiative aimed at maintaining the university as a safe place 
for students, faculty, staff and visitors. The prohibition of deadly weapons on campus is a 
proactive step toward reducing the risk of injury or death due to the intentional, 
accidental, inexpert or improper use of firearms.  
Statement 
Deadly weapons are not permitted on any property owned or controlled by the university. 
For the purposes of this policy, a deadly weapon is any device designed to produce death 
or serious bodily injury. Deadly weapons include, but are not limited to: 
• Firearms, whether loaded or unloaded 
• Pellet, flare, tranquilizer, stun, spear and dart guns 
• Knives with blades larger than that of a folding pocket knife. 
• Switchblades 
• Daggers 
• Striking instruments, including clubs, truncheons, blackjacks, metal knuckles and sap 
gloves 
• Martial arts weapons, including nunchakus, tonfas, staffs and throwing stars 
• Bow and arrow combinations 
• Explosive devices, including hand grenades, bombs, black powder, smokeless powder, 
percussion caps, friction primers and pyrotechnic fuses. 

157 
 
 
The definition of deadly weapons under this policy does not include devices such as 
commercially available aerosol dispensers of non-lethal chemical irritants, pocket knives 
or general tools not designed as weapons. 
This prohibition against deadly weapons applies equally to those carried by persons with 
a government-issued permit or license. The only exceptions to this policy are those listed 
below. 
Exceptions 
This policy does not apply to: 
• Commissioned Carnegie Mellon police officers 
• Other duly-appointed law enforcement officers 
• Members of the United States armed forces when on duty 
• Any trained security personnel when approved in advance by the Chief of Police or his 
designee. 
It is recognized that there may be activities related to the educational mission of the 
university (e.g., physical fitness activities or theatrical productions) that may appear to 
violate the letter but not the intent of this policy. In such cases, the department or 
organization coordinating the activity is responsible for obtaining written approval from 
the Chief of Police or his designee, in advance, to conduct the activity. Such approval may 
extend for up to one year at a time. 
Violations 
Persons who possess deadly weapons in violation of this policy will be required by 
University Police to remove the weapons and/or themselves from university property. 
Any university student, faculty or staff member who violates this policy shall be subject to 
action in accordance with university disciplinary policies and procedures for students, 
faculty and staff. Further, possession of a deadly weapon in violation of federal, state or 
local laws will be referred to University Police or other appropriate law enforcement 
authorities and may result in legal sanctions. 
Call University Police at ext. 8-2327 to report violations or suspected violations of this 
policy. 

158 
 
 
Disorderly Conduct Policy 
Disorderly conduct is ordinarily defined as the use of abusive or obscene language or 
gestures to/by a member of the campus community, publicly intoxicated behavior or 
persistence, after a request to desist, in behavior which inconveniences or impedes other 
members of the campus community in their proper use of or passage through the campus 
area. It constitutes a basis for university disciplinary action and may result in the issuance of 
commonwealth citations or criminal action. 
Emergency Contact 
Every student is expected to designate an emergency contact person for the university to 
contact in the case of a personal emergency (i.e. you are injured, become ill, or are missing). 
This contact is considered confidential and will only be used for a personal emergency. 
To register an Emergency Contact do so by logging into Student Information Online (SIO) on 
The HUB website and updating their “Manage Family & Friends” information under the “My 
Info” tab. 
Emergency Preparedness and Response 
The purpose of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan is to provide governance, 
guidelines, and structure for the management of actions and operations needed to address 
immediate requirements for an emergency incident or planned event. 
The goals of the plan are: 
• Preserve life and safety of students, faculty and staff; 
• Provide concept of operations and direction, control, and coordination of resources 
needed for incident or event stabilization; 
• Protect University property, the community, and the environment; 
• Manage communications and information regarding incident and event response 
operations and safety; and 
• Provide and analyze information to support decision-making and action plans.

strategies, including the development of safety programs. EH&S will consult with external 
agencies or regulatory bodies as necessary and appropriate, on behalf of the university. 
1. Corrective Actions Reports and Citations: 
EH&S is authorized to survey and monitor all areas of the campus to assess 
environmental risks, life safety exposures, and training requirements, and to

In the event that EH&S orders cessation of an activity, EH&S will immediately 
communicate the problem(s) and violation(s) to the individual, to his or her direct 
supervisor, to other administrators with responsibility for the department or center 
involved, and the appropriate regulatory agency, when required by law. 
The activity may be resumed only with the approval of the EH&S director or designee, in 
consultation with the provost or vice president as appropriate, and the relevant 
administrators or supervisors. 
Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy 
Policy Statement 
Carnegie Mellon University is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and 
Affirmative Action (EEO/AA). 
The university bases its employment decisions on the principle of equal employment 
opportunity. All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, 
training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education 
tuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance 
with the university's commitment to non-discrimination. 

165 
 
 
Further, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for 
employment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and 
veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements 
are used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and 
complies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or 
ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related 
disability. 
Reason for the Policy 
This EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an 
update on current responsibilities. 
The university recognizes that its success depends on the development and use of the full 
range of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. 
It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and 
enhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university 
intends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon 
stronger in sustaining world-class distinction. 
Regulatory Compliance 
The university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by 
Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state 
and local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and 
applicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, 
discrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under 
the above statutes and executive order. 
The U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the 
applicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy. 
Accountability 
This policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by 
the president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice 
president for human resources and director for equal opportunity services. 

166 
 
 
Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top 
management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer 
responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This 
responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department 
heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical 
component of university operations. 
Responsibility 
The broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal 
employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and 
affirmative action are everyone's responsibility. 
In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity 
commitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for 
coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and 
implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the 
attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans 
and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate 
university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external 
organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action 
issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, 
as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment 
Assistance Act (VEVRAA). 
Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include:

Fire Extinguisher & Sprinkler Systems 
Fire extinguishers and full-coverage sprinkler systems are provided in residence halls and 
other university areas to increase the safety of the occupants. Activating or discharging them 
for any reason other than extinguishing a fire is a violation of university regulations and will 
be subject to disciplinary action. 
Freedom of Expression Policy 
Note: In early September, 2017, the university convened a group to review this Policy in light of recent 
events on campuses around the country. Pending the outcome of that formal review later this semester, and 
in order to enhance the environment for free expression at the university and ensure the safety of the 
community, the university is instituting an interim change to this Policy. Effective immediately, individuals 
and organizations who are not Carnegie Mellon students, faculty or staff who wish to distribute printed 
material, offer petitions for signature, make speeches or hold protests or demonstrations outside University 
buildings, are required to meet the same standards for outdoor events as are already applied to events 
inside campus buildings, including the requirements that events must have sponsorship from a member of 
the university community and must meet registration requirements. These interim changes will assure that 
events are planned thoughtfully, with the safety and security of members of our campus community being 
paramount concerns. Students, faculty, and staff will still enjoy normal use of outdoor campus spaces 
according to university policy. Questions should be directed to Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student 
Affairs. 
Policy Statement 
Carnegie Mellon University values the freedoms of speech, thought, expression and 
assembly - in themselves and as part of our core educational and intellectual mission. If 
individuals are to cherish freedom, they must experience it. The very concept of freedom 
assumes that people usually choose wisely from a range of available ideas and that the 
range and implications of ideas cannot be fully understood unless we hold vital our rights 
to know, to express, and to choose. The university must be a place where all ideas may be 
expressed freely and where no alternative is withheld from consideration. The only limits 
on these freedoms are those dictated by law and those necessary to protect the rights of 
other members of the University community and to ensure the normal functioning of the 
University. 
Rights 
On Carnegie Mellon's campus, anyone may distribute printed material, offer petitions for 
signature, make speeches, and hold protests or demonstrations outside university 
buildings. All such activities must be peaceful, avoiding acts or credible threats of violence 

168 
 
 
and preserving the normal operation of the university. No event shall infringe upon the 
rights or privileges of anyone not in sympathy with it, and no one will be permitted to 
harm others, damage or deface property, block access to university buildings or disrupt 
classes. The enforcement of these conditions will not depend in any way on the message 
or sponsorship of the act or event. When guests are invited by a recognized campus 
organization, they may express their ideas not because they have a right to do so, but 
because members of the campus community have a right to hear, see, and experience 
diverse intellectual and creative inquiry. Defending that right is a fundamental obligation 
of the university. Controversy cannot be permitted to abridge the freedoms of speech, 
thought, expression or assembly. They are not matters of convenience, but of necessity. 
Responsibilities 
Freedom of expression must be at once fiercely guarded and genuinely embraced. Those 
who exercise it serve the Carnegie Mellon community by accepting the responsibilities 
attendant to free expression. University organizations that sponsor invited guests to 
campus are expected to uphold Carnegie Mellon's educational mission by planning 
carefully to create safe and thoughtful experiences for those involved. Hosts are 
responsible for the behavior of their guests and should exercise due care to ensure that 
all participants abide by relevant university policies. 
Considerations for Planning Campus Events 
Consistent with the rights and responsibilities outlined in the university's policy on 
Freedom of Expression, university hosts must follow all applicable policies related to 
space reservation, use, safety and security, keeping in mind the responsibility to have 
campus police present for any event with 100 or more persons in attendance. 
Hosts should consider the items below as guidance in planning campus events, 
recognizing that not all of the items below will apply to all events: 
1. 
A public declaration of the event, its purpose, the identification of sponsors and co-
sponsors, and contact information for those seeking further information. 
2. 
A plan for advertising the event, including advance notice to relevant members of the 
community who may wish to co-sponsor, protest, or host other events in response to 
the planned activity. 
3. 
Where appropriate, a clear and detailed contract with outside speakers, artists, or 
suppliers of services to ensure continuity of purpose and the ability of the host to 
reasonably control the event, consistent with the host's intent. 

169 
 
 
4. 
A plan for access to the event, including notifying the community of reserved seats, 
ticketing, queuing protocol, or other relevant details or restrictions well in advance of 
the activity. 
5. 
A provision for security before, during, and after events, managed in coordination 
with the University Police. Specifically, non-university security personnel must have 
their allowable duties clearly delineated, in partnership with the University Police, 
with their role generally limited to personal security and not space management. 
6. 
A plan for participant engagement at the event, such as through a question and 
answer session, if relevant, with a clear delineation of the planned ground rules for 
the event set out well in advance. 
7. 
A strategy for hosting of additional events, discussions, or town meetings before or 
after a principal event to help provide a context in which the principal event may be 
best experienced. 
The Office of Student Activities and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs may assist in, 
or directly coordinate, some aspects of campus events, such as fostering discussions 
preceding or following an event, or accommodating an opposing view at an alternative 
event. It is assumed that the spirit of community, both among people and groups with 
opposing views, as well as between event sponsors and the Student Activities and Student 
Affairs staffs, will foster communication and cooperation in the planning of campus 
events. Whenever possible, Student Affairs will work in concert with University Police to 
notify occupants of buildings in advance of any potential disruption caused by such 
events. 
Security Personnel Statement 
At times, members of the campus community or their invited guests may have a 
legitimate basis for being accompanied by independent security personnel. It is 
incumbent upon the host of such an individual to ensure that the University Police 
approve in advance the presence and scope of involvement of any such security 
personnel. 
Hazing 
Students have a right to be treated with respect and dignity by and among their peers. 
Hazing is inconsistent with Carnegie Mellon University’s values and is strictly prohibited. On 
October 19, 2018, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted the Timothy J. Piazza 

170 
 
 
Antihazing Law. Consistent with Pennsylvania law, the university defines hazing as any action 
or situation on or off campus that intentionally, knowingly or recklessly endangers the mental 
or physical health or safety of a student or that willfully destroys or removes public or private 
property for the purpose of initiation or admission to, affiliation with, or as a condition for 
continued membership in, any organization operating under the sanction of or recognized by 
the university. Any such activity shall be presumed to be forced regardless of the individual’s 
willingness to participate. 
Students and/or recognized student organizations accused of violating this hazing policy or 
violating Pennsylvania criminal hazing laws (shared below) will be subject to investigation and 
review through the university community standards process, which could result in 
disciplinary action up to and including suspension or expulsion from the university for 
students and loss of recognition for student organizations.

Safe Harbor for Individuals Seeking Medical Attention Resulting from Hazing Activities 
Consistent with the active medical assistance protocol expectations, an individual shall 
receive immunity from the university’s community standards process for allegations 
stemming from violations of this policy if all of the following apply: 
1. 
The university first became aware of the individual's alleged violation of this hazing 
policy because the individual called or contacted university police or student 
emergency medical services, based on a reasonable belief that another individual 
was in need of immediate medical attention, that had otherwise not yet been sought, 
to prevent death or serious bodily injury. 
2. 
The individual provided their own name to the university dispatch operator or 
equivalent security officer, police or emergency services personnel. 
3. 
The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in 
need of medical assistance until security, police or emergency services personnel 
arrived and the need for the concerned individual's presence had ended. 
Similar immunity from criminal prosecution for hazing offenses under Pennsylvania law is 
described under 18 Pa C.S.A. § 2210. 

171

residential areas where appropriate. No bicycles shall be parked or stored in such a 
manner as to block entrance/exit from any building, to impede the normal movement of 
wheelchair users or others with special mobility needs, and/or to any interior or exterior 
stairway or railing. Storage of bicycles should not violate fire safety regulations. Such 
violations in residential buildings will result in removal and storage of the bicycle. 
Students may be charged a fine and storage costs. While every attempt will be made to 
not damage a bicycle while in the process of removal or storage, the university is not 
liable for damage to a bicycle removed because of a violation. To claim a bicycle removed

This information is in addition to the university policy on bikes. 
Break Periods 
The Housing License Agreement covers fall and spring semesters only, typically mid-
August through mid-December for fall, and early/mid-January through mid/late-May for 
spring. (See the Housing License Agreement for any given academic year for exact dates 
of occupancy.) The Housing License Agreement covers all break periods except for Winter 
Break and summer. 
During Thanksgiving and fall and spring breaks, residents can stay in their rooms without 
extra charges, as all residence halls remain open. 
During Winter Break, most residence halls close, but housing residents are allowed to stay 
in designated residential buildings (an additional fee applies.) Students in open buildings 
need to apply for Winter Break housing online and get pre-approval to stay. Residents will 
receive Winter Break information in late October or early November. 
Summer housing is available for students who are attending summer school or students 
affiliated with the university and require housing for a period equivalent to a summer 
school session. An on-campus residence hall is selected each spring for summer housing. 
The minimum amount of time a student can apply for housing is one summer school 
session. There is a charge for summer housing. 
Bulletin Boards and Posting Notices 
The posting of notices, announcements or posters on bulletin boards in residence halls is 
restricted to recognized student organizations, individual Carnegie Mellon students and 
university departments/ programs. Bulletin boards in the living areas of residence halls 
are regulated by the Residential Education staff, while bulletin boards in other public 

176 
 
 
areas are regulated by Student Government. Bulletin boards in individual living units are 
under the direct control of the Resident Assistant (RA) and the members of that living unit. 
Those wishing to disseminate information through these bulletin boards must follow the 
process managed by the Office of Residential Education. Information about the poster 
distribution process is available on this website under Resident Communication.  All 
postings on bulletin boards within the residence halls must comply with the Housing 
Services Solicitation Policy. 
Cable Television Service 
Cable television service is provided to all residents. Students must bring their own 
televisions and cable cords to connect to the outlets in their rooms. Students are not 
permitted to have individual or private cable service in University owned or operated 
housing. 
Cancellation of Housing & Refund Policy 
In general, housing cancellations and refunds are not issued unless a student is leaving 
the university, due to leave a leave of absence, suspension, withdrawal from the university 
or studying abroad. Any student who is released from their housing contract will be 
assessed a housing cancellation fee, which is a non-refundable fee, unless the cancellation 
request is made during the Open Cancellation period in the spring semester immediately 
following Room Selection. It is the student’s responsibility to contact Housing Services if 
they will not be returning to the university, or if they are a current resident taking a leave 
or withdrawing mid-semester. 
Students who participated in Room Selection have an opportunity immediately following 
Room Selection to cancel their housing assignments within the timeline of the Open 
Cancellation Period. As long as the cancellation request is made during the open 
cancellation period window of time, students will not be assessed the cancellation fee. 
Please visit the Room Selection website for more information. 
Christmas Trees and Decorations 
Natural Christmas trees and greens are not permitted in university housing because of 
the significant fire hazard they create. Holiday decorations are permitted, but they may 
not use electrical lights or other devices that have not been approved by Underwriters 
Laboratories. 

177 
 
 
Common Area Painting 
Students who want to paint a common area (lounge/study/recreation room/hallway) of a 
residential building must receive permission from Housing Services, coordinated through 
their Housefellow. All proposed projects will be reviewed and approved/denied by their 
housefellow and Housing Services. Once approved, the painting may begin. Appropriate 
creativity is encouraged and some communities have sponsored contests to identify 
designs. Contact your Housefellow for details and support. 
Common Area Responsibility 
As stated in the Housing License Agreement, each resident is responsible for any damages 
or losses that occur in the assigned living areas or to any of the furnishings therein and 
the residents may be charged the cost of any repairs, replacement or reasonable 
custodial service. Each student is, with the other residents, jointly responsible for 
whatever damage may occur, for any cause, to public and semi-public areas in the 
residence halls. All residents may be charged a prorated share of the cost of repairing 
public areas. 
Cooking 
Cooking in residence hall rooms is strictly prohibited for health and safety reasons, with 
the exception of "compact" microwave ovens under 700 watts. Cooking is permitted only 
in areas specifically provided as kitchen areas, such as apartment kitchens and common 
area kitchens properly equipped by the university.  Prohibited appliances (see policy listed 
below) may not be used in any residential space including kitchens.  Housefellows may 
grant exceptions for programmatic use. 
Electrical Appliances/Prohibited Appliances 
No electrical appliances that incorporate unshielded heating elements and/or draw more 
than 700 watts may be used in campus residence buildings, including student rooms, 
kitchens and all building common areas. 
Microwaves, refrigerators, and Keurigs, as well as standalone rice cookers and electric 
kettles under the guidelines outlines below, are only permitted if they are 700 watts or 
less. Electric irons may be used only in areas where special utility outlets are provided, 
such as in designated utility or laundry rooms. 
Prohibited items include (but are not limited to) any slow cookers, electric or traditional 
pressure cookers, hot plates, toasters/toaster ovens, coffee pots, induction cooktops, 
halogen lamps, space heaters unless provided by Housing Services and any electrical item 

178 
 
 
not Underwriters Laboratory approved. If you are uncertain about whether or not an item 
is prohibited, please contact Housing Services prior to purchasing. 
Electric kettles and standalone rice cookers are approved for use in residential kitchen 
spaces only and are not able to be used in student bedrooms or living areas that are not 
designated kitchen spaces; this includes in-room and community kitchen areas. The 
guidelines for use of these approved appliances include: 
• used in approved spaces only (i.e. designated kitchen spaces/areas only) 
• be properly plugged directly into an approved wall receptacle (120V) 
• unplugged when not in use 
• not left unattended when in use 
• have an automatic shut off or boil dry protection 
• must be UL listed and labeled 
Fire Safety 
Residents incur a penalty fee of $200 for violating fire-safety guidelines as established by 
Environmental Health and Safety. Furniture left in corridors that cannot be identified will 
be returned to storage by Housing Services facilities crew to avoid fire hazards. Per the 
Common Area Responsibility policy students may be charged for the removal and storage 
of these items. 
Sprinkler heads and smoke detectors should not be tampered with, altered, or covered in 
any way. Residents should not hang any items from sprinkler heads. 
The use of fire escapes for any reason other than emergency evacuation is strictly 
prohibited. 
Guests and Visitors 
Visitors and guests are allowed in residence halls. At all times, residents are personally 
responsible for the actions of their guests. As a result, residents are responsible for any 
damage, physical or otherwise, to the community caused by their visitors. If the guests are 
Carnegie Mellon students, then they also accept responsibility for their actions. 
All visitors or guests to a room are subject to the approval of all room residents. Overnight 
guests are not permitted for more than two consecutive nights. 
Henderson Wellness House 
Henderson House is designated as a wellness community promoting holistic health and 
well-being within a traditional residence hall setting. House residents are expected to 

179 
 
 
maintain a substance free (no alcohol, tobacco or other drugs) lifestyle and environment 
for themselves and guests.  
Housing Disability Accommodation Policy 
Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in the provision of housing to students 
with disabilities. Carnegie Mellon will provide reasonable accommodations to students 
with disabilities who need special housing accommodations to ensure that students with 
disabilities receive comparable, convenient and accessible housing at the same cost as to 
other students. Carnegie Mellon will make reasonable modifications to its housing 
policies, procedures and practices when such modifications are necessary to avoid 
discrimination, unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the 
housing services provided by the University. Please visit the special accommodations page 
for full details about the housing accommodations policy, including applicable deadlines 
and forms required when requesting special accommodations. 
Hoverboards 
Hoverboards are not permitted in all university operated housing (including residence 
halls, apartments, and Greek Houses). If you currently possess a hoverboard, we 
recognize that you may need assistance making shipping arrangements (due to postal 
regulations) or storing it until a later date. Should you find yourself in this situation, please 
contact your Housing Services Facility Coordinator (FC) as soon as possible. 
Illegal Possession of Keys 
Students are responsible for access gained through the use of their assigned access 
device. Access devices include keys, student ID card, or Mobile ID app. Swapping or 
sharing or copying these items is not permitted as your name data is associated with your 
assigned access device. Students found using or having in their possession any access 
device for any university doors or facilities that they are unauthorized to use or possess 
will be subject to disciplinary action. 
Improper Use of University Facilities 
Improper use of facilities will be construed as the occupation, alteration or use of 
university facilities that would create a potential fire hazard, safety hazard to any person 
or property, or potential danger to any person or property. 
Inspection and Privacy 
Authorized representatives of the university may enter resident accommodations at any 
time to inspect facilities or to carry out repairs and maintenance. The inspection of 

180 
 
 
facilities will be conducted with at least 24 hours prior notice in writing whenever that 
notice can be reasonably given. If any Housing Services or residential life staff member 
enters a student room without a prior request or written notice, the student will receive a 
report documenting the time and purpose of entry. The university may authorize 
entrance to an accommodation if convinced that a clear and present danger or a violation 
of the university's regulations requires such entrance. (This regulation applies to campus 
housing as well as other university space.) 
Mail, Packages, and Deliveries 
All mail and packages for all campus housing residents must be addressed and sent to the 
individuals Student Mail Code (SMC) box.  Mail and packages includes anything sent 
through the United States Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, DHL, Amazon Prime, etc.  No mail or 
packages of any kind should be sent directly to the street address of the residence hall or 
apartment building.  Housing Services bears no responsibility for the damage, theft, or 
removal of any packages that are sent directly to the building addresses. In order to 
ensure that your package and mail is safe and secure, you must send it to your SMC code 
address. 
All mail and packages should be addresses as follows: 
First/Preferred Name and Last Name 
SMC #### 
5032 Forbes Avenue 
Pittsburgh, PA 15289 
Deliveries of food or groceries through a delivery service such as InstaCart or PostMates 
should only be placed when you will be present and available to accept delivery of your 
order.  Food or groceries that are delivered and not received directly by the resident may 
be removed and discarded as they create health issues and can attract unwanted pests. 
Microwave Ovens 
Residents may bring their own compact microwaves to campus as long as they are under 
700 watts. 
Open Flames and Combustible Materials 
Open flames or combustible/flammable materials of any kind, including (but not limited 
to) candles, incense, flammable liquids and gases, pretreated charcoal, fireworks and 
other such combustibles, are absolutely prohibited in university housing. 

181 
 
 
Outdoor Poster Policy for Residential Areas 
No signs, posters or banners of any size shall be hung outside or around any residential 
building, except upon special request. This applies to all residence halls, apartment 
buildings and houses as well as fraternities and sororities. Special consideration may be 
given, on request, for groups to use outdoor postings during university-wide special 
events. Requests for exceptions to this policy should be made to the Director of Housing 
Services. 
Pets and Animals 
Except as set forth below, pets and other animals are not permitted in any university 
housing facilities, including fraternities and sororities. 
 
• Fish in an aquarium no larger than five (5) gallons are permitted in university housing 
facilities. 
• Emotional support animals may be permitted within a student’s personal living space 
in a university housing facility, with prior written approval from the Office of Disability 
Resources. An emotional support animal is an animal that is necessary to afford a 
person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling when there is 
an identifiable relationship or nexus between the person’s disability and the assistance 
the animal provides. Requests for accommodations regarding emotional support 
animals should be submitted to the Office of Disability Resources. 
• Service animals are permitted inside university housing facilities but may be prohibited 
from accessing certain environments where the presence of an animal presents a 
health or safety risk (e.g. kitchens, laboratories, sterile facilities, etc.). Service animals 
are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for 
people with disabilities. Student residents who wish to maintain a service animal in 
their dormitory must first contact the Office of Disability Resources for more 
information. 
For more information regarding service animals and emotional support animals please 
visit the special accommodations page. 
 
In addition, the following standards apply to service animals and/or emotional support 
animals maintained in university residence facilities: 
 

182 
 
 
1. Any emotional support animal or service animal must be healthy and free of 
communicable disease. If appropriate for the animal, documentation of all 
veterinarian recommended vaccination must be provided to the Office of Disability 
Resources. New proof of vaccination must be provided before the previous proof of 
vaccination expires. 
2. Dogs must be properly registered with the City of Pittsburgh. Registration 
documentation must be submitted annually to the Office of Disability Resources. 
3. Emotional support animals are only permitted in the approved student’s private living 
space. Animals are not permitted in any public or common spaces within the 
residence facility, except as necessary to bring the animal into and out of the building 
as needed. Housing Services or the Office of Student Life may establish reasonable 
restrictions on how an emotional support animal is transported into and out of the 
building. 
4. Emotional support animals approved by the Office of Disability Resources for 
university residence facilities are not permitted inside other campus buildings. 
See The Word. 
5. Emotional support animals are not permitted in the private living spaces of other 
residents of the facility. 
6. The student is responsible for any damages caused by the service animal or 
emotional support animal in the student’s private living space or elsewhere. 
7. The student is responsible for the behavior of the service animal or emotional 
support animals, even when the student is not present in the living space. 
8. The student is responsible for providing appropriate care for the service animal or 
emotional support animal at all times, including the clean-up and disposal of any 
waste. Animal waste or bags containing animal waste cannot be placed in garbage 
chutes or common area trash cans. 
9. The service animal or emotional support animal may not be disruptive to the 
community. Disruptive animals may be removed. 
10. Emotional support animals must wear collars and identification tags at all times. 
11. Carnegie Mellon reserves the right to remove any animal that is not appropriately 
cared for. To ensure that appropriate care is available at all times, students are 

183 
 
 
encouraged to establish a plan to care for the animal in the event the student is 
unable to do so (e.g. due to illness or emergency). 
12. Carnegie Mellon reserves the right to establish other reasonable expectations or 
restrictions at any time to ensure the health or safety of the community. 
Individuals with concerns or complaints regarding animals in residence facilities should 
contact a Resident Assistant or University Police. 
Personal Property and Insurance 
Students are responsible for insuring their own personal property, including for losses 
due to fire, smoke, water and theft. The University is not responsible or liable for any loss 
or damage to the students' personal property and does not provide any property or 
liability insurance coverage for students' benefit. The University reserves the right to store 
at no liability for a limited period of time (for a period not to exceed 30 days), discard or 
donate personal property or any other belongings remaining in an accommodation after 
the accommodation has been assigned to another student or has not been vacated by a 
prescribed time. The University reserves the right to charge the student a fee for any 
storage of personal property or other belongings provided by it. 
Privacy and Behavior Standards 
All residents have the right to determine the private activity that takes place in their 
assigned rooms. Members of the floor also have the right to determine community 
standards for the floor. Roommates have equal voice in determining the private activities 
of the room, and one roommate's rights must not infringe upon another roommate's 
rights. 
Public Lounge Facilities 
At the beginning of each academic year, a layout of each lounge area and its contents will 
be inventoried and may be posted in the lounge. The furniture and contents of the lounge 
facilities should not be removed from the lounges under any circumstances without the 
expressed authorization of the building's Facility Coordinator. In addition to disciplinary 
action, student(s) found with common area furniture will be charged the standard hourly 
labor rate to return each piece to its proper location. 
Quiet Hours 
Quiet hours for all residential areas are 8 pm - 8 am on Sunday through Thursday nights, 
and Midnight - 9 am on Friday and Saturday nights. During finals week or reading days, 
24-hour quiet hours will be in effect. For long vacation weekends, weekend hours will be 

184 
 
 
in effect until the night before classes resume. Courtesy hours exist at all other times, 
during which the right of residents to live in an environment free from bothersome noise 
should be respected. 
"Quiet" is defined as being unable to hear any noise at a distance of 10 feet from a room 
with a closed door. During "courtesy" hours, noise can be considered bothersome if it can 
be heard at a distance of 50 feet. 
The notion of "courtesy" more broadly involves structuring your activities so that other 
people in your living unit are not adversely affected by noise. In particular, all residents 
are encouraged to carefully plan their use of sound equipment (such as stereos and TVs) 
or their social gatherings so that the noise produced by them does not infringe upon the 
rights of others. 
The established quiet hours stated above are the minimums for every residential area. If 
you or anyone in your living unit believes that quiet hours should be extended, contact 
your Resident Assistant (RA) or Student Dormitory Council representative. That person 
has the authority to conduct a vote of the people living in your area and, pending 
unanimous approval, extended quiet hours will be implemented. 
If you have concerns in relation to quiet hours or courtesy hours in your living area, please 
feel free to consult your RA. The RA is your primary advocate in situations involving noise 
violations and can assist you by addressing any questions or concerns you may have. 
Quiet Living Areas 
Welch and designated first-year housing areas offer quiet living, a particularly desirable 
alternative to traditional on-campus housing for undergraduate students. This 
designation provides an assurance to all residents in these buildings, and to all residents 
in the surrounding area, that resident students will act with the highest degree of 
common courtesy and respect for others in maintaining a particularly quiet and 
unobtrusive environment. 
This designation includes a provision for an extension of the university’s current quiet 
hours policy to 24 hours. As such, residents will be responsible for ensuring that the noise 
generated within their apartments or residence hall room is not audible at a distance of 
ten feet from their apartment or residence hall room. Common courtesy will be expected; 
residents should respond to any request from a fellow resident to reduce the noise level 
from their apartment or residence hall room, even if already within this guideline.  
The following specific guidelines will also exist: 
 

185 
 
 
• Stereos, televisions and radios will be permitted but must be used only in accordance 
with the general policy.   
• Use of musical instruments will not be permitted. 
• Social events and private gatherings will be permitted; however, they must be very 
small and are subject to the above standards. 
It is hoped that this designation of a quiet living area will allow students choosing this area 
to maintain a residential environment which will enhance the academic atmosphere and 
support the important goal of maintaining these special living environments offered on-
campus. 
Refrigerators 
Residents may bring their own mini-refrigerators to campus as long as they are smaller 
than 4.3 cubic feet and operate on 110/120 VAC. Residents who do not remove personal 
mini-refrigerators upon checking out will have their student accounts charged $40 per 
hour for removal and $160 for refrigerator disposal/recycling. Refrigerators are limited to 
one per student. 
Right to Housing Privileges 
In signing a Housing License Agreement, each resident agrees to abide by whatever 
regulations may be established by the university, Housing Services, the Residential Life 
staff, the Student Dormitory Council or the individual living units. Any resident student 
whose conduct does not meet the standards established for the university community 
may be denied the privilege of campus residency. 
Room Condition Responsibility 
All residents of a room or apartment are equally responsible for the accommodation and 
its furnishings. At the end of each academic year, any damages to a student's room will be 
charged to the occupants of that room. 
Room Alterations 
Students are not permitted to make permanent alterations to the furniture or structure of 
rooms or other residential areas. Prohibited actions include (but are not limited to) 
painting, drilling or nailing into the walls, and construction or renovations. Housing 
Services maintains a rotation schedule that allows for all residential areas to be painted 
and maintained on a regular basis. Students who make alterations to their room without 
authorization will be charged the cost of having the room professionally repaired. All 

186 
 
 
decorations should be hung using removable temporary adhesives such as Command 
strips or painters tape and any additions to the room must be free standing and not 
blocking exits. 
Security Camera Policy 
Housing Services is committed to safety, security and our residential community's quality 
of life. All building entry doors are locked 24 hours a day and right of entry is granted 
through access on an individual’s CMU ID card. Additionally, security cameras are located 
at the main entrances and high pedestrian traffic locations on building perimeters. The 
security cameras are not monitored live unless deemed necessary by CMU Police and 
recordings obtained with the use of the cameras will be exclusively accessed by CMU 
Police for safety and law enforcement purposes. 
Recorded images will be stored for 30 days and will be erased unless retained as part of a 
criminal investigation, court procedure, or other necessary safety practice. 
A list of camera locations may be available by written request to the Director of Housing 
Services or his/her designee. 
Smoking 
All residential areas within the university housing system including Fairfax Apartments 
and Webster Hall are smoke-free living environments. This policy prohibits the smoking of 
tobacco or any other substance in residential areas. In accordance with Housing Services 
policies, residents must also abide by policies prohibiting the use of any open flame for 
any reason, including but not limited to the burning of candles, incense, etc. This 
designation not only includes the actual residents of the area, but also extends to their 
guests. As such residents will be responsible for ensuring that any violation of this policy 
will be reported to the proper authorities and any violations of this policy will be 
appropriately enforced. The Smoke-free Living Policy was developed through the efforts 
of students, faculty and staff to assist residents and their guests to maintain a residential 
environment, which minimizes their exposure to second hand smoke and its impact on 
the health of others. 
Solicitation and Sales 
Unauthorized sales and/or solicitation are expressly prohibited in any residence area. 
"Solicitation" is defined to mean any effort to ask for donations or contributions of money, 
goods or services. "Sales" are defined to mean any activity of offering a product or service 
in exchange for money, goods or other services. In exceptional cases, an individual or 
group seeking permission to be in the residential areas for the purpose of soliciting or 

187 
 
 
selling must receive written authorization from the Director of Housing Services or his/her 
designee. In most cases, those recognized groups or individuals that receive permission to 
be in the residence halls will be restricted to tables reserved for such purposes in public 
areas or lobbies.  
Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs 
Swimming pools, hot tubs, and any other item containing large amounts of water are 
prohibited because of the hazards associated with drowning, electrocution, water damage 
and the weight of large volumes of water. Because we cannot guarantee that all necessary 
safety precautions will be taken, students are not permitted to have or use items such as 
swimming pools, hot tubs, dunk tanks, or slip n slides in or around residential buildings. 
Reducing the size of the pool or tank does not remove the hazard.  
University Furniture 
Unwanted room furniture cannot be stored during the academic year. Closet doors in 
rooms and apartments also may not be removed. Do not, under any circumstances, leave 
furniture in the hallway corridors. Rooms with missing furniture at the end of the 
academic year will be charged the full replacement cost for each missing item. This also 
applies to summer housing residents. 
Waterbeds 
Waterbeds are prohibited in university housing because of the potential for significant 
damage to the residence halls and to students' personal property if a waterbed breaks or 
is vandalized. 
Weapons Policy 
In accordance with the University Deadly Weapons policy, deadly weapons are not 
permitted on any property owned or controlled by the university. Additionally paintball 
guns, pellet guns, airsoft guns and realistic replica weapons are prohibited in and around 
residential buildings. Residents and guests who qualify for an exemption as outlined in 
the University Deadly Weapons policy must also receive written approval from the 
Director of Housing services or his/her designee. 
Window Screens 
Students are not permitted to remove screens from their windows. Missing screens or 
screens that have been removed from windows will be reinstalled at the student's 
expense.  

188 
 
 
Wires and Utility Lines 
No wire may be strung outside any living unit or any alterations made to any university 
residential building without the express permission of Housing Services. This includes 
satellite dishes, radio and television aerials. 
In addition, no student or student organization may alter or tap into university utility lines, 
television antenna wires or cable lines without the express permission of Housing 
Services (in the case of resident facilities) or Facilities Management Services (in the case of 
other campus buildings). 
Information Security Policy

the purpose of inspection of facilities or for the purpose of planning or carrying out repairs 
and maintenance. Such inspections will normally be conducted according to announced 
schedules, but the university reserves the right to enter the space without prior 
announcement. The university may authorize entrance to an accommodation if convinced 
that a clear and present danger or a violation of the university's regulations requires such 
entrance. (This regulation applies to campus housing as well as other university space).

Missing Student Protocol and Confidential Contact 
In accordance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (20 U.S.C. § 1092(j)), 
Carnegie Mellon has adopted this Missing Student Notification Protocol. Each student has the 
option to register a Confidential Contact person who will be notified by Carnegie Mellon if the 
student is determined to be missing. 
Confidential Contact information will be kept confidential and will only be accessible by 
authorized personnel in furtherance of a missing person investigation. Students who wish to 
register a Confidential Contact for notification through the missing student protocol may do 
so by logging into Student Information Online (SIO) on The HUB website and updating their 
“Manage Family & Friends” information under the “My Info” tab. 
Missing Student Procedures 
Any community member may contact the University Police or Office of the Dean of 
Student Affairs to report concern that a student may be missing. If the report did not 
originate through University Police, the information will be immediately conveyed to 
University Police to begin an investigation. 
If the University Police investigation determines that the student is missing, the university 
will notify the student's Confidential Contact no later than 24 hours after the 
determination that the student is missing. If the missing student is under the age of 18 
and not emancipated, the university will contact a custodial parent or guardian, in 
addition to the Confidential Contact. The university will also notify the appropriate local 
law enforcement agency within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing. 
In addition to notifying the Confidential Contact, the University is required to notify a 
custodial parent or guardian of the missing status of any student under the age of 18, and 
not emancipated. 
No Contact Agreements/No Contact Orders 
Carnegie Mellon is committed to providing support and resources to any student who may 
be the recipient of persistent unwanted or harassing contact by another student.  In certain 
circumstances, it may become necessary for the university to formalize an arrangement 
between two students to no longer have contact with each other (direct or indirect) other 
than that which is necessary for either party to continue their academic pursuits. Such an 
arrangement is designed as a protective measure to help mitigate the potential for future 
problematic interactions between the two students.  The arrangement may take the form of 
either a No Contact Agreement or No Contact Order, as follows: 

191 
 
 
A No Contact Agreement (NCA) is a mutual agreement between two students who voluntarily 
affirm that they will not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect contact through 
third parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. An NCA does not 
constitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it preclude the 
possibility of future review of any past interactions through the community standards 
process. Following discussion and agreement to enter into the NCA, the two students will 
receive a letter confirming the terms of the agreement. In the event that a student declines to 
enter into a requested NCA, an associate vice president of student affairs may elect to review 
the matter to determine whether a No Contact Order is warranted. Please see a sample No 
Contact Agreement (pdf). 
A No Contact Order (NCO) is a directive from an associate vice president of student affairs 
indicating that two students may not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect 
contact through third parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. 
An NCO may be issued: 
• when, upon careful review, the associate vice president deems there is sufficient 
information presented that doing so will safeguard students’ abilities to pursue their 
education in an environment free from unwanted contact. In such an instance, the NCO 
does not constitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it 
preclude the possibility of future review of any past interactions through the community 
standards process; or 
• in connection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure during 
the pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of responsibility 
from the process. 
No Contact Orders issued after a finding of responsibility are most often binding only on the 
responding party.  However, in limited circumstances, they may be mutual. Carnegie Mellon 
will carefully consider the individual circumstances of the situation, including the burden 
placed on the reporting party by issuing a mutual No Contact Order. 
Please see a sample No Contact Order (pdf). A student who receives an NCO may appeal the 
decision in writing to the dean of students (a NCO received as a sanction through the 
community standards process may be appealed via the appeal procedures set forth in the 
Community Standards section of The Word). 
Once implemented, any violation of an NCA or an NCO will be vigorously pursued as an 
alleged violation of community standards through the community standards process. An NCA 
or NCO remains in effect until it has been terminated, in writing, by the Office of the Dean of 

192 
 
 
Student Affairs following a determination that the arrangement is no longer warranted or 
necessary. 
A student considering request of an NCA or NCO may discuss the situation with a 
Housefellow, a College Liaison, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Office for 
Institutional Equity and Title IX, the Office of Community Standards & Integrity, the Office of 
Residential Education, or University Police. 
Noise 
Members of the university community have a right to work, study, practice and live in an 
environment free from disruptive noise. Acknowledging our desire to foster a vibrant campus 
culture, which will necessarily involve some noise associated with campus activities, the 
following expectations are intended to guide thoughtful planning and decision-making by 
students and student groups: 
Activity occurring on Carnegie Mellon-owned or managed property that disrupts the normal 
course of business or is otherwise disruptive to the university or surrounding communities is 
restricted during the following hours: 
• Monday - Thursday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 6:50 p.m. 
• Friday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 10:00 p.m. 
• Saturday and Sunday: before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. 
To fully support our vision for campus life, it is necessarily the case that some organized 
activities will merit consideration for exception to these articulated hours. Such requests are 
encouraged and should be submitted via this form to the Director of Student Leadership, 
Involvement, and Civic Engagement for review and approval. 
Any time that excessive noise results in a reasonable complaint from individuals within or 
beyond the campus, the responsible party is expected to reduce the volume immediately. 
Failure to meet such a request from a university official will be referred for disciplinary 
review, separate and apart from any citations or other actions that may be taken by law 
enforcement authorities. 
Any individual who would like to make a complaint about excessive noise is encouraged to 
immediately direct it to University Police, (412) 268-2323, who will maintain a record of the 
complaint in connection with their response. 

193 
 
 
On-Campus Emergencies 
University Police Emergency Phone Number: (412) 268-2323 
If You Discover a Fire 
1. 
If you can, quickly put out the fire using a proper fire extinguisher. Report the 
incident promptly to University Police at (412) 268-2323. 
2. 
If you see that a fire cannot be quickly extinguished, activate the nearest fire alarm 
station and evacuate the area. 
Basic Evacuation Instructions 
1. 
Whenever an alarm sounds, evacuate immediately. If you can safely close all 
windows in your area before leaving, do so. 
2. 
Close your door as you leave, making certain that you have your keys with you (heavy 
concentrations of smoke may make your return necessary). In dormitory buildings at 
night, turn the room lights on as you leave to signal your evacuation. 
3. 
Help retard the spread of smoke and flames by closing fire doors behind you as you 
pass through the building. Fire doors should never be obstructed or blocked open.  
4. 
Move quickly to the nearest building exit, but refrain from running. 
5. 
Do not attempt to use elevators for evacuation purposes. 
6. 
If you encounter heavy smoke, change your exit route to the next available exit. Help 
guide others if you appear to be more familiar with the building. 
7. 
As you exit, move well away from the building exterior to assure your safety and to 
provide ample room for responding firefighters and emergency equipment. 
No one is to re-enter an evacuated building until it has been determined safe to do so by 
the ranking fire department officer at the scene. 
Aid to the Physically Challenged 
Blind and mobile persons should first be moved out of the rush of traffic, and then 
promptly assisted to the nearest exit. Deaf and mobile persons may be unaware of the 
need to evacuate, and should be calmly advised and guided to the nearest available exit. 

194 
 
 
Immobilized persons 
To reduce the risk of personal injury, attempts to carry immobilized persons are 
discouraged. Wherever stairs are a part of the evacuation route, the following procedures 
are to be applied: 
1. 
As soon as a fire alarm sounds, the physically impaired person is to be quickly moved 
to reasonable safety, preferably to an enclosed room or space that smoke or flames 
cannot easily enter. This action needs to be accompanied by a verbal explanation so 
that the person being assisted understands what is happening and why these actions 
are being taken. Again, elevators cannot be used safely for evacuation purposes. 
2. 
If a telephone is available, University Police (412-268-2323) should immediately be 
contacted and advised of the individual's name and location within the building and 
the phone number from which the call is being made. If alone, the disabled person 
may wish to remain on the phone with University Police. 
3. 
If available, a companion, or other responsible person may stand by to remain with 
and assist the physically challenged individual. 
4. 
Upon clearing the building, a floor marshal or other designated person from the 
same floor area should alert responding firefighters and/or University Police to the 
exact location of the person or persons. If it becomes necessary for removal from the 
building, this can then be carried out by trained, equipped, emergency personnel. 
Additional information can be found on the Environmental Health & Safety website. 
CMU Alert Emergency Notification Service 
CMU-Alert is Carnegie Mellon's emergency notification service, which sends voice and/or 
text messages to your registered phone in the event of a campus emergency. 
All students are pre-registered for CMU-Alert. Faculty and staff are encouraged to register 
for the service (login required) if they have not already done so. You can register by 
clicking on the link in the box to the right.  
Your contact information will be treated confidentially. You will be contacted by the CMU-
Alert service only if there is an incident/event that threatens public safety or during tests 
of the system in the spring and fall semesters. 
Note that the text and voice options may carry a nominal fee for recipients, depending on 
your mobile phone carrier and mobile phone plan. Questions or concerns about the 
service can be emailed.  

195

Notification System website. 
Personal Wheeled Vehicle Transportation Policy 
Definitions 
Personal Wheeled Vehicles: Refers to vehicles used for personal transportation, human-
powered or powered by an electric or other non-internal combustion motor. Bicycles are 
the prime example. Personal wheeled vehicles also include skateboards, in-line skates, 
scooters, electric bicycles, Segways, and other vehicles. For the purposes of this Policy, this 
definition does not include any vehicles which require a Pennsylvania driver’s license to 
operate, such as gasoline-powered scooters and two-wheeled, seated vehicles which fall 
outside the PennDOT definition of a “pedalcycle”. (See Pennsylvania Consolidated 
Statutes, Title 75, § 102. at Definitions.) 
Operation 
• In any circumstances, anyone using a wheeled vehicle of any type must yield the right 
of way to pedestrians. 
o Walk or carry your vehicle when campus traffic is congested. 
o Pass with caution on the left and alert the people around you before doing so. 
• Operators are required to operate at speeds that are prudent and reasonable under 
existing conditions. Speed limit of five (5) miles per hour shall be observed while on 
shared paths with pedestrian traffic. 
• No person is allowed to operate any wheeled vehicle: 
o Inside any building; 
o On any pedestrian building access ramp; 
o On, across or through landscaped or grass areas. 
• The university strongly encourages bicycle and other wheeled vehicle operators to 
wear a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission approved helmet or equivalent 
protective device. 
• Operators traveling in a manner that is deemed unsafe by a University Police Officer 
may be issued the appropriate citation. 
• Any type of wheeled vehicle that requires a driver’s license is prohibited from 
operation on shared-use paths on campus. These vehicles are only authorized for use 
on public streets and are subject to the regulations of the City of Pittsburgh and of the 
Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. 

196 
 
 
Registration 
The university's Transportation Services department allows you to register your bicycle or 
other personal wheeled vehicle. There is no fee for registering. Registering can greatly 
help in retrieving a bicycle or other vehicle in case of theft. It also allows the university to 
contact the owner for retrieval if the vehicle is parked improperly or abandoned. 
Parking 
A personal wheeled vehicle is parked/stored on campus at the risk of its owner. For 
operators' convenience, bicycle racks are provided at various campus locations. These 
racks are appropriate for bicycles and other two-wheeled vehicles. Information 
about using bicycles and wheeled vehicles on campus, including a list of rack locations, 
can be found on the Transportation Services website. In order to maintain campus 
accessibility for all users, no wheeled vehicle shall be parked, stored, or left standing in 
such a manner as to: 
• Block entrance to or exit from any building or structure on campus; 
• Block outdoor walkways or stairs; 
• Impede the movement of persons with disabilities; 
• Inhibit the full use of campus infrastructure, such as benches, handrails, ramps, 
railings, and other such furniture; 
• Damage or potentially damage trees, artworks or landscaping; 
• Impact any other location in a way that violates federal, state or local fire and safety 
regulations. 
Personal wheeled vehicles left in such areas will be removed immediately and 
impounded. 
Finally, the use of any indoor area for wheeled vehicle parking is restricted when, in the 
best judgment of the person(s) responsible for that area, storage therein interferes with 
the routine activities normally conducted in that area. When accessing an indoor parking 
area (i.e. designated indoor parking rooms, personal offices, etc.), vehicle owners should 
use the most direct path to avoid impedance of indoor pedestrian traffic. 
Removal and Impoundment of Wheeled Vehicles 
Any University Police Officer, Transportation officer, or official authorized by the university 
may remove and impound any wheeled vehicle which: 
• Is parked in violation of any of the sections of this policy; 
• Appears to have been abandoned as evidenced by signs of disuse or neglect. 
The university's Transportation Services department allows you to register your bicycle or	other personal wheeled vehicle.	There is no fee for registering. Registering can greatlyracks are appropriate for bicycles and other two-wheeled vehicles.		Information	about using bicycles and wheeled vehicles on campus, including a list of rack locations,			can be found on the Transportation Services website.	In order to maintain campus		
197 
 
 
Bicycles or other wheeled vehicles impounded may be recovered only upon proof of 
ownership and after required fees are paid. Owners are responsible for all costs involved 
in removal and storage of impounded items.  
Unclaimed wheeled vehicles shall be held for a minimum of six months by Transportation 
Services, at which time the owner shall be presumed to have relinquished legal title. Such 
bicycles shall be disposed of through proper legal procedure. 
The CMU Police Department, Facilities Management Services, Transportation Services, or 
other university departments are not responsible for any alleged damage or loss of 
accessories or equipment of an impounded vehicle. 
Pets 
Pets are permitted outside on campus grounds when leashed and properly attended. No 
animal may be left tied to trees or other objects on campus. In all cases the owner of the 
animal is responsible for the animal’s behavior and any damage caused by the animal.   
Except as noted below, students and their guests are not permitted to bring dogs, cats or 
other pets inside any university buildings, including residence facilities, fraternities and 
sororities, classrooms, and other academic or administrative facilities.  
More information regarding service and emotional support animals can be found through 
the Office of Disability Resources. 
More information regarding pets and housing policies can be found on the Housing Policies 
website. 
Students or student organizations that would like to host an on-campus activity or event that 
involves animals (such as a petting zoo) must receive prior permission. Such requests are 
encouraged and should be submitted via this form. 
Students are expected to properly respect, attend to, care for and treat any pets or animals 
that they maintain or interact with in any capacity. 
Community members should contact University Police if a problem arises with any animal. 
Any unattended animal(s) will be picked up and impounded by University Police or Animal 
Control officers. Guidelines for how impounded animals are handled in the City of Pittsburgh, 
which can include adoption or euthanasia. 

198 
 
 
Policy Against Retaliation 
It is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to protect from retaliation any individual who 
makes a good faith report of a suspected violation of any applicable law or regulation, 
university Policy or procedure, any contractual obligation of the university, and any report 
made pursuant to Section 9 of the Carnegie Mellon University Code of Business Ethics and 
Conduct. 
Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students shall not in any way intimidate, reprimand or take 
retaliatory action against any individual who makes a good faith report of a suspected 
violation.  Individuals who violate this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary 
action, up to and including dismissal from the university. 
An individual who knowingly or intentionally makes a false report of a violation may also be 
subject to disciplinary action. 
Reporting Violations 
Individuals are encouraged to report suspected violations of this policy or any other legal, 
policy or contractual obligation through standard management channels, such as to their 
immediate supervisor or other appropriate University officials. However, an individual 
who for any reason feels uncomfortable reporting a suspected violation through 
established channels may file a report through the University's Ethics Reporting Hotline: 
 
CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY ETHICS REPORTING HOTLINE 
TOLL FREE: 844-587-0793  
Via the Internet: cmu.ethicspoint.com 
Reports of suspected violations submitted to this hotline may be made confidentially, 
and even anonymously, although the more information that is given, the easier it is to 
investigate the reports. 
Policy for Use of Carnegie Mellon University Trademarks 
Policy for the Use of Carnegie Mellon University Trademarks 
Carnegie Mellon University owns and controls its name(s), logos, insignias, seals, crests, 
designs, symbols and any other marks associated with the university (hereafter “Carnegie 
Mellon trademarks” or “trademarks”). The purpose of this policy is to provide information 
and guidelines to the university community regarding the use of Carnegie Mellon's 

199 
 
 
trademarks. Carnegie Mellon operates a licensing program through the Trademark 
Licensing Office, which controls the use of Carnegie Mellon trademarks. The overall 
purpose of the licensing program is to protect Carnegie Mellon University's trademarks 
and to ensure such trademarks are used in an appropriate manner for the benefit and 
promotion of the university. 
In order to comply with and assure protection under federal, state, and international 
trademark law, Carnegie Mellon University is required to monitor all uses of its 
trademarks. Unauthorized use of Carnegie Mellon trademarks is subject to civil and 
criminal penalties.  
A license is required for any individual, organization, or company to reproduce or 
otherwise use Carnegie Mellon’s name or trademarks for a commercial or non-
commercial venture. All uses of Carnegie Mellon trademarks on commercial or non-
commercial products require prior approval from the Trademark Licensing Office or 
another university official authorized to sign license agreements under the Policy for 
Authority to Commit the University. All licensees of Carnegie Mellon trademarks must 
comply with the Carnegie Mellon Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees. 
Approval of trademark licenses is also subject to the Guidelines for Carnegie Mellon Code 
of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees using Trademarks as set forth in this 
Policy. 
Members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including faculty, staff, students, student 
organizations, and colleges, schools, departments, centers, etc., should seek written 
approval from the Trademark Licensing Office prior to the production of any product 
bearing Carnegie Mellon’s name or trademarks. 
Overview of Carnegie Mellon Trademarks 
Carnegie Mellon University owns and controls its name(s), logos, insignias, seals, crests, 
designs, symbols and any other marks associated with the university (hereafter “Carnegie 
Mellon trademarks” or “trademarks”). These trademarks include both registered and 
unregistered marks. Carnegie Mellon trademarks include, but are not limited to the 
words: Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon; CMU; Carnegie Institute of 
Technology; Carnegie Tech; Tartans; and the phrase “My Heart is in the Work.”  Carnegie 
Mellon trademarks also include, but are not limited to, designs and logos, such as the 
official seals of Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Institute of Technology; the 
stylized acronym CMU; the Scottie Dog logo and the Scottie Dog mascot.  
The Trademark Licensing Office and Marketing and Communications protect the use of 
the official tartan(s) associated with Andrew Carnegie and Carnegie Mellon. 

200 
 
 
Carnegie Mellon University has registered many of its trademarks in the United States and 
in foreign countries. For questions concerning whether a particular mark is a Carnegie 
Mellon trademark, please contact the Trademark Licensing Office. 
Using Carnegie Mellon Trademarks 
Carnegie Mellon's trademarks are intended to present a positive image of the university. 
All trademarks should be used in an appropriate manner for the benefit and promotion of 
the university. Carnegie Mellon trademarks may not be altered in any way. 
The university's trademarks may not be used in any manner that suggests or implies an 
endorsement of other organizations, companies, products, services, political parties, or 
religious organizations.  
The university's trademarks may not be used in any way that will discriminate against any 
persons or groups based on age, ancestry, belief, color, creed, disability, national origin, 
race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or veteran status, or in any other way that would be 
a violation of the university's anti-discrimination policies. 
Internal Use of Carnegie Mellon Trademarks 
Subject to the paragraph immediately following, members of the university community, 
including faculty, staff, students, student organizations, and academic colleges, schools, 
departments, centers, etc., should seek written approval from the Trademark Licensing 
Office prior to producing or having produced any products bearing Carnegie Mellon 
trademarks. Items include, but are not limited to, apparel, headwear, binders, coffee 
mugs, glassware, and cell phone covers. Approval may be subject to the Product and Art 
Approval Guidelines below. 
When Carnegie Mellon University trademarks are used on print items e.g., business cards, 
external publications, display items, or on university-owned websites by faculty, staff or 
students for university business or educational purposes, such uses of Carnegie Mellon 
trademarks should comply with the Brand Standards established by the Marketing and 
Communications Division. No approval from the Trademark Licensing Office is required 
for such uses. 
Class Projects 
Any item/artwork/project produced as part of a course and which uses Carnegie Mellon's 
trademarks for non-commercial purposes does not require a license and is royalty 
exempt. For the purpose of monitoring use to assure protection of the trademark. 
However, the student or team leader should notify the Trademark Licensing Office of the 

201 
 
 
use of a trademark prior to the start of the project. Faculty and staff members should 
direct students to notify the Trademark Licensing Office when necessary under this policy. 
Third-Party Use of Carnegie Mellon Trademarks 
A license is required for any individual, organization, or company to reproduce or 
otherwise use Carnegie Mellon’s name or trademarks for a commercial or non-
commercial venture. Each specific use of a Carnegie Mellon trademark requires written 
approval from the Trademark Licensing Office. All licensees must comply with the 
Carnegie Mellon Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees. Approval of 
licenses is also subject to the Product and Art Approval Guidelines below.  
Approval for a specific use or design for one application does not grant permission to 
alter the design in any way or to use the same design for another purpose, without 
seeking additional written approval from the Trademark Licensing Office. For example, 
approval to use a particular design on a T-Shirt does not automatically grant approval to 
use the same design on a coffee mug. 
Third-party organizations that need to use Carnegie Mellon University’s trademarks in 
relation to verifiable partnerships or non-commercial or promotional activities should 
request permission to do so from the Marketing and Communications Division. Any 
permission granted would be documented in an agreement signed by both parties. Third-
party promotional products co-branded with Carnegie Mellon University trademarks 
requires dual art review from the Trademark Licensing Office and the Marketing and 
Communications Division. 
Product and Art Approval Guidelines 
All products bearing Carnegie Mellon trademarks should follow the Merchandise 
Guidelines established under the Brand Standards established by the Marketing and 
Communications Division. 
Carnegie Mellon will not license products that do not meet minimum standards of quality 
and/or good taste in university’s sole opinion, or products that are judged to be 
dangerous or carry high product liability risks. The following products normally will not be 
approved by the Trademark Licensing Office: 
• products that could be used to injure or kill; 
• products that could present a high-liability exposure; 
• alcoholic beverage products; 
• tobacco-related products; 

202 
 
 
• sexually suggestive products; 
• obscene, disparaging, or discriminatory products; 
• products that are inimical to the mission or image of the university.

• art depicting sexual acts; 
• art depicting statements impugning other universities; 
• art or a design incorporating trademarks or copyrights not owned by the university, 
unless written permission for such use is obtained from the mark holder or copyright 
owner. 
Carnegie Mellon reserves the right to approve or disapprove any use of trademarks, even 
if not explicitly prohibited by these guidelines. 
Product and Art Approval Panel 
The Trademark Licensing Office reserves the right to interpret the Product and Art 
Approval Guidelines and decline to grant licenses for uses that violate the guidelines. The 
Trademark Licensing Office may also refer any questionable or potentially controversial 
licensing requests to the Vice President and General Counsel and the Vice President for 
Marketing and Communications, or their designees. Appeals of decisions made by the 
Trademark Licensing Office may also be referred to the Vice President and General 
Counsel and the Vice President for Marketing and Communications, or their designees. 
Selecting Suppliers 
The Trademark Licensing Office has established licensing agreements with a number of 
suppliers who provide a variety of products. A complete list of all current licensees is 
available at http://www.cmu.edu/trademark/suppliers/index.html. Individuals or groups 

203 
 
 
seeking a supplier should first review this list to determine if the required items may be 
obtained from one of the current licensees. If it is necessary to use a supplier that is not 
licensed, consult the Trademark Licensing Office. 
Royalties 
Royalties are collected from a licensee for the use of Carnegie Mellon's trademarks. The 
net income from the licensing program benefits the overall mission of Carnegie Mellon; 
after expenses are covered, net income is used for the university's Education & General 
Operating (E&GO) budget. Contact the Trademark Licensing Office for information on 
royalty-exempt products.

Policy on the Protection of Children in Carnegie Mellon University 
Programs, Activities and Facilities 
Policy Statement 
The mission of Carnegie Mellon University includes creating and disseminating knowledge 
and art through research, creative inquiry, teaching and learning and transferring our 
intellectual and artistic product to enhance society in meaningful and sustainable ways. 
Pursuing this mission includes engagement, outreach, and service to the community. In 
particular, Carnegie Mellon endeavors to support improvements in early childhood 
education, primary and secondary education, including pre-college, through research, 
education, recreation, and community service. These endeavors also enhance the 
professional and personal growth of Carnegie Mellon students. This engagement with the 
broader community necessarily involves interaction with minor children (under the age of 
18). Carnegie Mellon is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all 
minors involved in any programs or activities conducted on university premises, as well as 
any off-campus programs or activities sponsored by the university. This Policy sets forth 
the university’s legal obligations, requirements for and expectations of faculty, staff, 
students, contractors, and volunteers who operate and/or participate in such programs. 
The purpose of this Policy is to ensure the safety and well-being of minors while setting 
high standards to encourage the pursuit of excellence in our engagement, outreach, and 

204 
 
 
service to the community. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including 
faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers, are expected to act in accordance with 
this policy. 
This policy describes three separate and independent requirements:  
• First, in Section II, it describes a “Program Registration” requirement which will allow 
the university to ensure that programs involving minors satisfy the requirements of 
the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, 
as well as other best practices related to health, safety, program operation, parental 
permission, risk management, etc. 
• Second, in Section III, the Policy sets forth the requirements for background 
certifications that are required by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law when 
working with minors. These requirements are independent of the program registration 
requirements in Section II. Before working with minors, please make sure of your 
obligations under both Sections II and III. 
• Third, in Section IV, the Policy sets forth the requirements for the mandatory reporting 
of suspected child abuse under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. 
I. Definitions 
• The terms “child,” “minor” and “minor child” are defined as any individual less than 
eighteen (18) years of age.* 
• “Matriculated Student” is defined as a student who is enrolled at Carnegie Mellon and 
pursuing a program of study that results in a postsecondary credential, such as a 
certificate, diploma or degree.*  
• “School Employee” is defined as an individual who is employed by Carnegie Mellon or 
who provides a program, activity or service sponsored by Carnegie Mellon. This 
includes any faculty member, staff member or student-employee.* 
• "Responsible Individual" is defined as the individual designated by a program or 
activity involving minors who is responsible for the administration of the program and 
compliance with this Policy. Depending on the nature of the program or activity 
involving minors, the responsible individual may be a faculty member, staff member, 
student, contractor, volunteer or a third-party. 

205 
 
 
• For purpose of Section II of this Policy, "Programs and Activities Involving Minors" is 
defined as any program, event, or activity involving one or more individuals under the 
age of 18 that is either: 
o Sponsored, funded and/or operated by any Carnegie Mellon administrative unit, 
academic unit, or student organization, regardless of location. This includes 
programs and activities conducted on-campus, off-campus, or remotely via the 
internet or other means of communication; or 
o Sponsored, funded and/or operated by a third-party entity and conducted on 
university property. 
The definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not include: [20] 
• Academic courses and related programs or activities, where the only minors involved 
are Matriculated Students, visiting prospective students and visiting / non-degree 
students. (Note: The University Registrar’s Office monitors non-degree students who 
are minor children and such students are only permitted to register for a class if the 
instructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain appropriate 
background certifications under Pennsylvania law.) 
• Any program or activity conducted on University property where the only minors 
involved are Matriculated Students and/or visiting prospective students. 
• Intercollegiate events where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students or 
students enrolled at another institution of higher education. 
• Events open to the general public where parents/guardians are required or expected 
to provide supervision for their children (e.g. a sporting event or a theater production). 
• Minors who are employees of Carnegie Mellon and are paid at least a minimum wage 
(note: co-workers of employees who are under the age of 18 may be required to 
obtain background certifications under Pennsylvania Law).[21] 
 
20 Exclusion from the definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not necessarily exempt individual faculty, staff, 
students, contractors, volunteers, or other third parties from compliance with the requirements of Section III regarding 
background certifications. Rather, exclusion from this definition exempts the activity from the registration requirements in 
Section II. 
 
* These definitions are based on the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. 
21 Unpaid internships (where permitted by applicable government regulations and HR guidelines) are not exempt from the 
definition of Programs & Activities Involving Minors. 

206 
 
 
• Human subjects research studies involving minor children that have been approved by 
the Institutional Review Board (note: the Office of Research Integrity Compliance will 
notify Child Protection Operations of any human subjects research studies involving 
minors so that there will be no need to separately register). 
• Routine interactions between family and friends. 
II. Requirements for Programs and Activities Involving Minors 
All programs and activities involving minors must satisfy the following requirements: 
1. 
All programs must register with Child Protection Operations, within the Office of 
Human Resources, and receive approval prior to engaging in any interactions with 
minors. Child Protection Operations will coordinate with each program or activity to 
develop appropriate procedures and training to ensure the welfare and security of 
minors who participate in the program. 
2. 
The review process conducted by Child Protection Operations will be based on the 
unique circumstances of each program and include consideration of the following 
key factors, among others: the nature of the program; the duration of the program; 
the entity sponsoring the program; the responsible individual(s); the number of 
participants and age ranges; the number of supervising adults; the facilities to be 
used; use of overnight accommodations; potential health and safety concerns (e.g., 
laboratory use, machinery, swimming pools, motor vehicles); transportation; 
protocols for accidents, injuries and emergencies; health and wellness plans; 
protocols for drop-off and pick-up; and one-on-one private interactions with minors. 
3. 
Written permission must be obtained from each minor's parent/guardian prior to the 
minor's participation in any program administered by Carnegie Mellon and/or any 
program administered by a third party on Carnegie Mellon property. 
4. 
Each program must identify a responsible individual who will be responsible for the 
administration of the program and compliance with this policy. Notwithstanding the 
requirements of and/or exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law 
or similar laws of other jurisdictions, the responsible individual must have valid 
background certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or 
similar laws of the applicable jurisdiction. 
5. 
In addition to background certifications required by law as described in Section III 
below, each program must ensure that at least one individual who has received 

207 
 
 
certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law and appropriate 
training is on site during the program or activity. That is, even if applicable law does 
not require any individual in a program to obtain background certifications, at least 
one individual on site during the program or activity must have a background 
certification and appropriate training. 
6. 
The college, department, unit, or student organization sponsoring the program may 
adopt background certification standards more stringent than the minimum required 
by law, such that any individuals participating in a program may be required to 
obtain background certifications even where such certification is not required by the 
Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or other applicable laws. 
III. Background Certification 
All faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers must satisfy the background 
certification requirements for interacting with minors in the applicable jurisdiction. 
Specifically, it is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to comply with the background 
certification provisions of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (23 Pa C.S.A. § 
6303 et. seq.), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153 of 2014. Detailed information 
regarding the requirements of and exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective 
Services Law is available on the Human Resources website.[22] 
These background certification requirements are separate from the program registration 
requirements set forth in Section II. Even though a position, activity, or program does not 
meet the definition of program or activity involving minors requiring registration under 
Section II, the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (or similar laws in other 
jurisdictions) may still require background certifications.  
As noted above, the University Registrar’s Office monitors non-degree students who are 
minor children and such students are only permitted to register for an undergraduate or 
graduate class if the instructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain 
appropriate background certifications under Pennsylvania law. 
 
22 The Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, requires any University employee 
who has Direct Contact (as that term is defined under the CPSL) with children under the age of 18 to obtain certain background 
certifications. However, the CPSL does not apply to University employees whose only interactions with children under the age of 
18 are limited to matriculated students and/or visiting prospective students. As such, most employees of Carnegie Mellon are not 
required to obtain background certifications in order to perform their job duties. But if an employee’s duties include direct 
contact with children under the age of 18 who are not matriculated students or visiting prospective students, the employee may 
be required to obtain background certifications under the CPSL. For more information see https://www.cmu.edu/hr/career/new-
employees/first-day/act-153.html. 

208 
 
 
Every employee and volunteer who is subject to the background certification 
requirements of this section has an obligation to notify the university if he/she is arrested 
for, or convicted of, any offense prohibited by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services 
Law. Notice of arrests or convictions must be provided within 72 hours. Notice should be 
submitted to Child Protection Clearances within the Office of Human Resources. 
If the university receives notice of an arrest or conviction for a prohibited offense or has 
reasonable cause to believe that an employee or volunteer has been arrested or 
convicted of a prohibited offense, the university will require the employee or volunteer to 
immediately obtain new background certifications. In such cases, the university may 
prohibit the individual from working with minor children pending receipt of new 
background certification.  
IV. Mandatory Reporting 
Under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law all school employees are mandatory 
reporters of child abuse. Volunteers who are responsible for the welfare of a minor or 
who have direct contact with minors are also Mandatory Reporters.  
Reports of child abuse must be immediately submitted to both: 
a) The Pennsylvania Department of Human Resources. Reports may be submitted: 
a. Orally via the Child Hotline at 1-800-932-0313; or 
b. Electronically via the website https://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis/public/home. 
b) Carnegie Mellon University Officials. Reports may be submitted to: 
a. Your supervisor, or 
b. University Police, or 
c. Office of General Counsel 
By law a mandatory report must be immediately filed if there is reasonable cause to 
suspect that a minor is the victim of child abuse in the following circumstances: 
• The Mandatory Reporter comes into contact with the minor in the course of 
employment, occupation and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled 
program, activity, or service; 
• The Mandatory Reporter is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance, or 
training of the minor, or is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, 
regularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly 
responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of a minor; 

209 
 
 
• A person makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory Reporter that an identifiable 
minor is the victim of child abuse; 
• An individual 14 years of age or older makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory 
Reporter that the individual has committed child abuse. 
Members of the university community located outside of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania are expected to comply with any mandatory reporting laws of the applicable 
jurisdiction. Questions regarding mandatory reporting requirements in other jurisdictions 
should be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel.  
Additional information about mandatory reporting laws in Pennsylvania as well as other 
jurisdictions is available at https://www.cmu.edu/ogc/Guidance/act_153/. 
Prematriculation Immunization Policy 
Policy Rationale 
The university values personal and community health and recognizes the critical role that 
each individual plays in contributing to community health by participating in personal 
health care practices that prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Participation in a 
vaccination program represents one such highly effective personal health practice. 
Vaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant threat to the public health of the campus 
community, impose a significant cost to infected individuals in terms of mortality and 
morbidity and impose a cost to other community members by disrupting university life 
and academic activities.  Therefore, the university expects that all individuals will value the 
importance of protecting themselves and others by obtaining vaccinations against 
vaccine-preventable diseases and acknowledges the institution’s role in supporting public 
health by monitoring the vaccination status of incoming students through its policy on 
immunization requirements. 
Policy Statement 
The goal of the university is to provide adequate protection of the campus community 
against vaccine-preventable diseases. This goal can best be achieved through a 
prematriculation immunization requirement that is administered by University Health 
Services (UHS). All students are required to comply with the immunization requirements 
and the screening protocol for tuberculosis. 

210 
 
 
Implementation Guidelines 
Immunization Requirements for Students 
• Required vaccinations shall be determined by UHS and shall be consistent with 
Pennsylvania State Law and informed by the recommendations of the American 
College Health Association and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 
• Vaccination requirements will be reviewed annually by UHS.  Any changes in the 
requirements effective  in the upcoming school year will be communicated to 
incoming students and the university community in the spring term prior to 
implementation that fall. 
• Application or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be 
determined by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with 
relevant colleagues in those locations. 
Additional Requirements for Students Residing in University Housing 
• Because vaccine preventable diseases spread more readily in a residential 
environment, UHS may set additional requirements for students who elect to live in 
university housing.  
Request for Waiver 
• A student may request a waiver from any vaccination for medical reasons or if 
vaccination conflicts with personal or religious beliefs by contacting UHS. If an 
outbreak of contagious disease occurs, the university reserves the right to ask 
students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until 
the outbreak is over. 
Screening Protocol for Tuberculosis 
• Students with an increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis are expected to comply 
with screening requirements as set forth by UHS and informed by recommendations 
of the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control.  
Penalty for Noncompliance 
• If a student fails to comply with the immunization policy, UHS will notify the University 
Registrar who will change the student’s enrollment status to reflect that the student is not 
enrolled until the requirements are met. 

211 
 
 
• Additionally, if the student is a resident in university housing and fails to comply with the 
immunization requirements, he/she will be removed from housing. A fee may be assessed 
by Housing for reactivation of the room key if the student later complies with the policy. 
Related Policies and Procedures 
The university complies with OSHA regulations regarding occupational exposure to blood-
borne pathogens. Questions regarding these regulations should be directed to 
Environmental Health & Safety, 412-268-8182. 
Public Art Policy 
Policy Statement 
Public Art is permanent or long-term art in public spaces on campus. This policy 
addresses the review, acquisition, acceptance, siting, and deaccessioning of public 
art.  Accepted public art becomes the management responsibility of the Department of 
Campus Design and Facility Development in the Office of the Vice President for Finance 
and the Chief Financial Officer.  
Art enhances the quality of life for all people and should be a part of the daily life of the 
students, faculty, and staff at Carnegie Mellon.  Carnegie Mellon is a leader in education 
for the arts and creative research and practice, and art on the campus and in public 
building spaces should reflect this leadership status. Acquired public art should expand 
the educational mission of the university and the College of Fine Arts by providing 
interesting and challenging work of high quality, accompanied by an interpretive program 
to make the works accessible to the non-specialist. 
The Public Art Committee (PAC) is established to: 
1. 
Review specific proposals for public art with the purpose of recommending to the 
president approval, suggestions for modification, or rejection of the public art, and its 
siting.  
2. 
Clarify the need for public art on the Carnegie Mellon campus and target specific 
siting opportunities, including both indoor and outdoor public spaces.  This work 
builds on the campus master planning process. 
Public art is acquired through donations, solicitations, purchases, and loans.  It should be 
recognized that the advocacy and selection of public art can be controversial and, at 
times, technically difficult.  Public art selection must address such issues as: artistic 

212 
 
 
quality, appropriateness, site context, public sensibility, durability, maintainability, safety 
and cost. 
Given the world class stature of our College of Fine Arts and many of its graduates, the 
university would be particularly pleased to have the opportunity to consider works by 
prominent alumni and faculty to celebrate their leadership contribution to their discipline 
and the world of art. 
As the university's financial strength becomes more robust and such funds become 
available, it is the university's aspiration that major new campus facilities projects will 
allocate a percentage of project funds for the acquisition, commission and/or integration 
of public art that will enhance the contribution of the new facility to the quality of campus 
life. If acquisition funding can be raised, consideration must also be given to maintenance 
and the future maintenance of the art endowed. 
Definition 
Public Art at Carnegie Mellon is considered to be permanent or long-term art in public 
spaces on campus, including all outdoor campus space and interior public spaces such as 
lobbies, social spaces, etc.  The PAC does not presume any authority over works of art, 
photographs, etc. that faculty and staff place on view in their offices or that departments 
install in their offices and teaching spaces.  Art is considered permanent if it is installed 
with no anticipated time limit or duration.  This policy does not address student or faculty 
art installations with a defined time limit, and which are covered by separate guidelines 
and coordinated by the College of Fine Arts.  
Process 
The Public Art Committee is advisory to the president and all proposed public art and its 
proposed site must be reviewed by the Public Art Committee and approved by the 
president and the Property and Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees before it is 
accepted by the university.  The PAC meets on an ad hoc basis as public art proposals 
require review, or to address other public art planning issues.  Recommendations of the 
PAC shall be upon a vote of the majority of members convened.  The Design Review 
Committee must be consulted on proposals for outdoor sites that require integration into 
the campus master plan. 
In order to ensure that the PAC has the opportunity to receive input from all campus 
constituencies, prior to recommending acceptance of a piece of public art the PAC shall 
hold at least one public meeting which all interested members may attend for purposes of 
hearing about and offering comment on the proposed piece.  Representatives of the 
primary user(s) of the space where the public art is to be sited must also be consulted. 

213 
 
 
Carnegie Mellon welcomes temporary installations in public spaces organized by 
departments or individuals. There is no need for the PAC to monitor short exhibits (six 
weeks or less). Exhibits of the Miller Gallery are also exempted from review by the PAC. 
Public Art Committee Membership 
The PAC is chaired by the dean of the College of Fine Arts.  An appropriate staff member 
designated by the provost shall provide administrative support. The PAC is made up of 
campus representatives who provide necessary judgmental and technical 
expertise.  Members shall include: 
Ex officio  
• Dean, College of Fine Arts (Chair) 
• Head, School of Art 
• Director, Miller Art Gallery 
• Associate Vice President for Campus Design and Facility Development (non-voting) 
• Secretary of the Corporation; Chief of Staff, Office of the President (non-voting) 
• Vice President, Advancement (non-voting) 
Faculty 
The University recognizes that it is important for the PAC to have wide-ranging input, 
including from faculty of the university who are non-specialists in the field of art.  In 
order to ensure that the views of non-specialist faculty are represented, three faculty 
members shall be appointed on a staggered basis by the deans of the Mellon College of 
Science, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Institute of Technology, School of 
Computer Science, College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Heinz School of Public 
Policy, according to the process set forth below.

215 
 
 
alumnus/a, a Pittsburgh-based museum director, or the head of a regional arts 
organization), appointed for a term of two years. 
The PAC membership also shall include at least one member of the Design Review 
Committee (who can be one of the individuals named above) and the Artistic Properties 
Committee (who shall be the university librarian serving as the university archivist or 
other librarian designated by him/her).  The PAC may call on others in the campus 
community or outside consultants for their technical expertise as approved by the 
Provost. 
Criteria for Acceptance/Rejection of Public Art 
The PAC will use the following criteria in considering gifts or purchases of public art: 
• Proposed art shall display a high level of artistic quality and craftsmanship that 
supports and enhances the academic and creative missions of Carnegie Mellon. 
Distinctive works of art chosen or created for campus public space shall be of 
sufficiently high quality to merit inclusion into Carnegie Mellon's permanent collection. 
• The "message" of proposed art, if any, shall be acceptable to current standards and 
policies of the Carnegie Mellon community. 
• An appropriate site in campus public space shall be available. 
• Proposed art shall be structurally sound and present no environmental or safety 
hazard. 
• An external funding source to cover all costs of acquisition, purchase, shipping, 
installation, wall-to-wall insurance, appraisal, and maintenance shall be determined 
prior to acceptance. If sufficient funding is not immediately available, this criterion may 
be waived in exceptional circumstances by the president. 
• The donor's clear title to donated art and authenticity of the work shall be confirmed 
prior to acceptance. 
Ownership and Deaccessioning 
Ownership and acquisition terms will be determined by the standard gift agreement 
between the university and the donor of public art.  The university, with the approval of 
the PAC, reserves the right to sell or donate works of public art. 

216 
 
 
Criteria for Deaccessioning 
The PAC may consider the deaccessioning of artwork for one or more of the following 
reasons in the event that it cannot be resited: 
1. 
A work is not, or is only rarely, on display because of lack of a suitable site. 
2. 
The condition or security of the artwork cannot be reasonably guaranteed. 
3. 
The artwork has been damaged or has deteriorated and repair is impractical or 
unfeasible. 
4. 
The artwork endangers public safety. 
5. 
In the case of site specific artwork, the artwork’s relationship to the site is altered 
because of changes to the site. 
6. 
The artwork has been determined to be incompatible within the context of the 
collection. 
7. 
The university, with the concurrence of the PAC, wishes to replace the artwork with 
work of more significance by the same artist. 
8. 
The artwork requires excessive maintenance or has faults of design or workmanship. 
Publications 
Publications produced independently by students must clearly state that they do not carry 
the endorsement of Carnegie Mellon University. All university-sanctioned student 
publications must be approved by the Office of the Dean of Students, and they should 
include the official CMU wordmark and Statement of Assurance. Visit the brand guidelines for 
more information. 
Recycling Policy 
This is to announce the adoption of the following Recycling Policy for the university. 
Carnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing 
non-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to 
support these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and 
preserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus-wide recycling 
program is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for 
Carnegie Mellon. Recycling is just one part of a much larger program of activities through 
which Carnegie Mellon will take an increasingly active role to further understanding and 
preservation of our environment in the years to come. 

217 
 
 
Facilities Management Services is responsible for the implementation of Carnegie Mellon's 
recycling program. The Environmental Coordinator in this department will be responsible for 
the management of the recycling program and coordination of waste reduction efforts on 
campus. Each department will designate, in writing, an official Recycling Liaison who will 
coordinate departmental recycling efforts with the Carnegie Mellon Environmental 
Coordinator. 
The entire campus community is expected to actively participate in Carnegie Mellon's 
Recycling Program and waste reduction efforts. This involves three distinct activities. 
1. 
Recycling of paper, cardboard and beverage cans (aluminum and bimetal). 
2. 
Source Reduction: This includes but is not limited to making double-sided copies, 
increased use of electronic mail instead of memos, reuse/resale of surplus furniture, etc. 
3. 
Purchasing products made from recycled materials. The long-term success of recycling 
programs in this country depends on the creation of markets for recycled materials. All 
departments should purchase recycled products wherever economically feasible. 
Recycling programs already functioning on campus are encouraged to continue and expand 
provided that they do not hinder the campus-wide recycling program. Individuals responsible 
for such programs must provide recycling volume data to the Carnegie Mellon University 
Environmental Coordinator to permit the university to comply with Pennsylvania Act 101 
(Pennsylvania Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 101 of 1988). 
Safety Intervention Protocol 
Carnegie Mellon is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for students, 
faculty, staff and visitors and may intervene in circumstances that seriously affect the health 
or well-being of any student, where physical safety is seriously threatened, or where the 
operations of the university are seriously disrupted. In keeping with this commitment, this 
protocol describes the procedures for assessing potential risk presented by students and 
interventions the university may enact. 
If safety is an immediate concern, an associate vice president of student affairs (or their 
designee), may determine the need to issue a mandate that: 
1. specifies the conditions for a student to maintain (or resume) her/his status as an enrolled 
student; and/or: 
2. requires a student to absent herself/himself from campus until specified conditions have 
been satisfactorily engaged or completed. 

218 
 
 
Any and all conditions of a mandate will be specified in a written letter from the associate 
vice president of student affairs to the student. Such conditions may include: 
• A behavioral contract; 
• A no contact agreement/order; 
• Transferring rooms within university housing; 
• Removal from university housing; 
• Completion of a pending community standards proceeding and/or investigation by the 
Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX; 
• Engagement in an appropriate care or treatment plan; 
• Temporary withdrawal from the university; 
• Signed releases of information or communication with support sources such as parents or 
treatment providers; and/or 
• Other conditions deemed reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. 
A mandate will only be issued when, in the professional judgment of an associate vice 
president of student affairs (or their designee), after considering all reasonably available 
information, it is determined that the student: 
• Poses a credible substantial risk of harm to individuals within the University or to the 
University community as a whole; or 
• Substantially impedes the lawful activities, the educational process, or the proper 
activities or functions of members of the University community.  
The decision to issue a mandate will be predicated on an individualized assessment of the 
student’s behaviors. The primary considerations in making this assessment will be the 
severity of the safety risk presented by the student, the impact of the student’s behaviors on 
the university community and the broader community, the student’s willingness or 
unwillingness to voluntarily engage in a level of care that is clinically indicated; and whether 
reasonable modifications of the university’s polices, practices or procedures significantly 
mitigate the risk.  Should a mandate be deemed appropriate, the university will identify the 
student affairs staff member(s) who will support and assist the student in meeting specific 
requirements and associated timelines for completion, which will be outlined in writing by 
the associate vice president of student affairs. If necessary, the student may be placed on an 
administrative leave of absence while completing these requirements. 

219 
 
 
A student who receives a mandate under this protocol may appeal the decision in writing to 
the dean of students. In connection with an appeal, a student may submit whatever 
additional evidence the student believes may be relevant to the decision. 
Safety Hazards 
The occupation, alteration, or use of university facilities that creates a fire or safety hazard 
(potential or actual), creates danger to individuals or others, or creates a threat to university 
property is a violation of university regulations and the individual responsible is subject to 
appropriate disciplinary action. 
No use of explosive or incendiary materials on university property in connection with 
programs or activities may take place without the explicit permission of the dean of students 
and the director of environmental health and safety or their designated representatives. 
Failure to abide by this regulation will result in suspension of social and competitive 
privileges of the organization and/or individual violating the regulation. 
Scheduling of University Facilities 
Scheduling of Space 
Any Student Senate recognized organization is entitled to reserve available meeting space 
on the campus without rental fee. Charges for special services may be made if deemed 
necessary. Any student organization holding a function, dance, or social event in the 
Cohon University Center with 100 or more people in attendance must employ a campus 
police officer for the event. If there are more than 200 people in attendance two officers 
must be present. The following procedures should be followed in making requests for 
space and special services: 
1. 
Requests for space should be made through the online space request system 
through the Cohon University Center. 
2. 
Arrangements for food service should be made by calling Dining Services at 412-268-
2129 or email. 
3. 
Arrangements for media technology needs should be made by calling 412-268-8855 
or email. 

220 
 
 
Rules Governing Rental of Space by Non-University Organization 
A non-university organization is one in which the membership and leadership consist 
primarily of individuals who are not members of the Carnegie Mellon community. The 
mere presence of Carnegie Mellon students and/or faculty in the general membership or 
even in positions of leadership of an organization does not make it a university 
organization, nor does the fact that the request for facilities is made either by a faculty 
member or a student. Where student organizations “sponsor” non-university 
organizations as defined above, the request will be treated as if the non-university 
organization itself had made the request. 
Non-university organizations may be allowed to use Carnegie Mellon facilities under the 
following conditions: 
1. 
They are organized primarily for professional or educational purposes. 
2. 
The request for facilities is submitted in writing at least 30 days prior to the event. 
3. 
The presence of the function on campus will not interfere with the normal activities 
of the university. 
4. 
Where there is a question in the mind of the authorizing officer about the 
appropriateness of the request, it will be referred immediately to the dean of 
students and the appropriate campus administrators. 
5. 
When a university group requests facilities for a meeting at which substantial off-
campus attendance would be expected and notice of the meeting would be 
disseminated beyond the campus, the request must be reviewed with the dean of 
students and the appropriate campus administrators. 
6. 
If an event is to be approved that will substantially reduce the facilities available for 
student use during periods when students are in residence, the request will be 
discussed with the Student Government before final approval is given. 
7. 
All requests for the use of Carnegie Mellon facilities by non-university organizations 
shall be made originally with the Office of Conference and Event Services at 412-268-
1125 or via email. Permission to use facilities may not be assumed until a room 
reservation form has been signed by the Office of Conference and Event Services or 
the dean of students. 

221 
 
 
Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) 
I. Policy Statement 
The mission of Carnegie Mellon University is to cultivate a transformative educational 
experience for its students that is committed to promoting and safeguarding their 
personal health and well-being. In addition, the mission is to create a collaborative 
environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, 
and entrepreneurship can flourish and where individuals can achieve their full potential. It 
is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to maintain an academic and work 
environment that promotes the confidence to work, study, innovate and perform without 
fear of sexual misconduct. Such misconduct diminishes individual dignity, is contrary to 
the values of the university and is a barrier to fulfilling the university’s mission. It will not 
be tolerated at Carnegie Mellon University. 
It is the responsibility of every member of the University Community to foster an 
environment free of sexual misconduct. All members of the University Community are 
encouraged to take reasonable and prudent actions to prevent or stop such behavior. 
The Interim Sexual Misconduct Policy (“Policy”) prohibits the types of misconduct listed 
below and defined in Section IX (also referred to collectively as “Prohibited Conduct”): 
• 
Sexual Assault; 
• 
Sexual Exploitation; 
• 
Sexual Harassment; 
• 
Stalking; 
• 
Dating Violence; 
• 
Domestic Violence; 
• 
Retaliation; and 
• 
Violation of Protective Measures. 
This Policy is intended to: (1) prevent, eliminate and remedy the effects of Prohibited 
Conduct; (2) foster an environment where all individuals are well-informed and supported 
in reporting Prohibited Conduct; and (3) provide a prompt, fair and impartial process for 
all parties once the university is made aware of possible Prohibited Conduct. While these 
principles are clear and straightforward, the detailed procedures set forth in this Policy 
are necessary to assure that these matters are handled in an impartial, thoughtful and 

222 
 
 
thorough manner, consistent with the university’s dedication to the integrity of its 
process. 
Furthermore, on May 19, 2020, the Department of Education issued a Final Rule under 
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with an effective date of August 14, 2020. 
The Final Rule governs how certain acts of sexual misconduct are defined under Title IX 
and sets forth the procedures and other requirements for adjudicating claims of such 
conduct (the “Final Rule”).  For purposes of this Policy, the conduct described in the Final 
Rule shall be referred to as “Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct.” Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct is defined as follows: 
• 
Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct — A subset of Prohibited Conduct that rises to a level 
of severity and pervasiveness such that it is prohibited expressly by the Final 
Rule. Prohibited Conduct meets the definition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct 
when:  
o A Faculty member or Staff member conditions the provision of an aid, a benefit, 
or a service on another Faculty member, Staff member, Student, or third party’s 
participation in unwelcome sexual conduct (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); 
o A Faculty member, Staff member, Student or third party engages in unwelcome 
conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive 
that it effectively denies another person equal access to the University’s Programs 
or Activities (commonly known as Sexual Harassment); or 
o A Faculty member, Staff member, Student or third party engages in Sexual 
Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence or Stalking. 
• 
Alleged conduct is Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (though it may still be Prohibited 
Conduct) only if: 
o The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and 
o The conduct took place within the University’s Programs or Activities. 
• 
Conduct that does not meet this strict definition for Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct is still prohibited by this Policy if it otherwise constitutes Prohibited 
Conduct (also referred to as “Other Prohibited Conduct”). 
Faculty, Staff, Students, or third parties who violate this Policy may face, as appropriate, 
disciplinary action up to and including termination, expulsion, or other actions. 

223 
 
 
Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to abridge the free expression of ideas that is 
essential to the university’s mission. The discourse conducted in accordance with the 
university's Freedom of Expression Policy and with the statement on Academic Freedom 
and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment and Tenure Policy, whether in written, 
spoken, or electronic forms, shall be consistent with this Policy. 
This Policy is intended to meet the university’s obligations under Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 (“Title VII”); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”); the 
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery 
Act”), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (“VAWA”), 
with respect to its application to sexual misconduct; and other applicable law and 
regulations. 
II. Jurisdiction 
This Policy applies to Faculty, Staff, Students, and third parties. This Policy covers acts of 
Prohibited Conduct committed by or against Students, Faculty, Staff, and third parties 
when the Prohibited Conduct occurs: 
• 
In a University Program or Activity, including, but not limited to,  
o conduct that occurs on a university campus or other property owned or 
controlled by the university; 
o in the context of university employment; or 
o in the context of university-sponsored study abroad, research, field work, practice, 
or internship programs; or 
• 
Outside of a University Program or Activity,  
o but poses a serious threat of harm, 
o has a continuing adverse effect on, or impedes equal access to educational 
programs or activities, or 
o creates a hostile environment for Students, Faculty, Staff, or third parties. 
The university retains discretion to determine whether out-of-program conduct is within 
its jurisdiction. In making this determination, including off-campus or online conduct that 
is not part of a University Program or Activity, the university will consider the severity of 
the alleged conduct, the risk of ongoing harm, whether both parties are members of the 
University Community, impact on University Programs or Activities, and whether off-
campus conduct is part of a series of actions that occurred both on and off campus. 

224 
 
 
This Policy supersedes any conflicting information in any other university policies with 
respect to the definitions or procedures relating to Prohibited Conduct. 
III. Prohibited Conduct 
Prohibited Conduct under this Policy includes the following specifically defined forms of 
behavior: Sexual Assault, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Harassment, Stalking, Dating 
Violence, Domestic Violence, Retaliation, and Violation of Protective Measures. Whether 
someone has engaged in Prohibited Conduct under this Policy will be assessed under a 
Reasonable Person standard. 
Some Prohibited Conduct, like certain sex based crimes, unwelcome conduct that is 
sufficiently severe and pervasive, and conduct that conditions an aid or benefit on 
unwelcome sexual activity, may also constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. 
Some forms of conduct which may be considered inappropriate or unacceptable within 
the Carnegie Mellon community, such as incivility or bullying, may not meet the definition 
of Prohibited Conduct under this Policy. However, the university retains discretion to 
report the conduct to an internal university department or authority such as Human 
Resources, Office of Community Standards and Integrity, or relevant academic 
department or dean to determine and implement appropriate responsive action, 
including review for possible misconduct under other university policies. 
IV. Reporting 
The university strives to create an environment where all members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community are aware of options for informing the university about instances of 
suspected Prohibited Conduct, how to seek assistance and support, and how to pursue 
university action for their own protection and that of the entire campus community. This 
Policy distinguishes the action of reporting from filing a Formal Complaint. Thus, 
information shared about suspected Prohibited Conduct does not automatically trigger 
formal action or an investigation, as discussed below in Section VI.B. This section outlines 
the mechanisms for reporting and how the university will respond to information it 
receives. 
Some forms of Prohibited Conduct may also constitute crimes. The university also 
strongly encourages any individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible 
criminal conduct to report them to the University Police Department or local law 
enforcement. Prompt reporting allows law enforcement to collect and preserve evidence.

The university maintains a Resource Guide for individuals who file reports of Prohibited 
Conduct that provides information for community members about filing reports 
of Prohibited Conduct through the university’s policies, support resources, community 
resources, and how to support a friend or family member who has been impacted by such 
conduct. Individuals who report Prohibited Conduct in Pennsylvania will also be informed 
of their rights as a victim of a crime under Pennsylvania law. 
A. How to Make a Report 
Any individual, including Complainants, Students, Faculty, Staff, or third parties are 
encouraged to submit reports of suspected Prohibited Conduct directly to the Office for 
Institutional Equity and Title IX in-person, via email, phone call, or online. Reports can also be 
made to the university officials listed in Section VIII who are designated with the authority to 
institute corrective measures. 
The university encourages all members of the Carnegie Mellon community to report to the 
Title IX Coordinator any information they learn about Prohibited Conduct. Sharing 
information of concern enables the university to offer support to impacted parties and 
protects the community from continuance of the alleged misconduct. Third parties should 
note that a report about possible Prohibited Conduct, including Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct, does not alone trigger a formal resolution process. Instead, as further explained 

226 
 
 
in Section VI.A, a Formal Complaint must be filed in order for the formal investigation and 
resolution process to commence. 
Certain employees identified as Responsible Employees must report information to the Title 
IX Coordinator so that the university can offer support and resolution options to the 
Complainant. These individuals are listed in Section VIII along with additional information 
regarding their obligations. 
Upon receipt of a report, the university will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss 
appropriate Supportive Measures (see Section V.A) and to explain the process for filing 
a Formal Complaint (see Section VI.A). Complainants are not obligated to respond to 
outreach from the university and the university will respect this decision, with limited 
exceptions where it is obligated by law or to act in the safety interest of the community. 
B. Anonymous Reporting 
An individual who is not a Responsible Employee may make a report of Prohibited Conduct to 
the Title IX Coordinator, and if preferred, may do so without disclosing one’s name using the 
online reporting form listed above and here: 
• cmu.ethicspoint.com 
Depending on the level of information available about the incident or the individuals 
involved, the university’s ability to respond to an anonymous report may be limited. The 
university will, however, take whatever steps it deems appropriate and in the best interests 
of the overall University Community, consistent with the information available. The university 
will never refuse to respond a report solely on the grounds that it was made anonymously. 
Information collected through the anonymous reporting line will be shared only with 
necessary university officials in order to respond to the reported concern. Information is kept 
confidential and no personally identifiable information is shared, except as necessary to 
follow this Policy, without the party’s consent. 
C. Reports to Law Enforcement 
An individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible criminal conduct may contact 
law enforcement directly by calling: 
• 911 (for emergencies off-campus) 
• University Police Department 
300 South Craig Street 
Pittsburgh, PA 15213

V. How the University Responds to Reports 
A. Supportive Measures 
The university is committed to helping Complainants continue their education and 
employment after experiencing Prohibited Conduct. Regardless of whether a person 
chooses to pursue an investigation, alternative resolution, a formal resolution, or chooses 
not to pursue any further process, the Title IX Coordinator or a designated university 
official conducts an initial assessment to determine next steps and will initiate contact to 
discuss the availability of Supportive Measures. 
Supportive Measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services, 
accommodations, and other assistance that the university offers and may put in place, 
without fee or charge, after receiving notice of possible Prohibited Conduct. Supportive 
Measures are designed to restore or preserve access to the University’s Programs and 
Activities, protect the safety of all parties and the university’s educational environment, or 
deter Prohibited Conduct, while not being punitive in nature or unreasonably burdening 
either party. 
Supportive Measures are available regardless of whether the matter is reported to the 
university for the purpose of initiating a formal resolution under this Policy and before, 
after, and regardless of whether a Formal Complaint is filed. A Complainant who requests 
Supportive Measures retains the right to file a Formal Complaint, either at the time the 
Supportive Measure is offered or requested or at a later date. Any Complainant that 
requests Supportive Measures will be informed in writing of their right to simultaneously 
or subsequently file a Formal Complaint pursuant to this Policy. 
Upon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact 
the Complainant (1) to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures and (2) to explain 
that Supportive Measures are available with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint. 
The Title IX Case Manager helps determine the appropriate Supportive Measure(s) to be 
implemented. The Title IX Case Manager will assess with the Complainant the unique facts 
and circumstances of their situation and identify steps to help the individual meet their 
educational or employment expectations. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will 
serve as the point of contact for implementing any identified measures to ensure the 
burden of implementation does not fall on the recipient of the Supportive Measures. 

228 
 
 
Supportive Measures will not be disciplinary or punitive in nature and will not 
unreasonably burden, or unreasonably interfere with the educational pursuits of, either 
party. Whether a possible Supportive Measure would unreasonably burden either party is 
a fact-specific determination that takes into account the nature of the educational 
programs, activities, opportunities and benefits in which an individual is participating. 
Supportive Measures may also be requested by and made equally available 
to Respondents, witnesses, and other impacted members of the University Community. 
Examples of Supportive Measures include: 
• Academic support services and accommodations, including the ability to reschedule 
classes, exams and assignments, transfer course sections, or withdraw from courses; 
• Academic schedule modifications (typically to separate Complainant and Respondent); 
• Work schedule or job assignment modifications (for university employment); 
• Changes in on-campus work or university housing location; 
• On-campus counseling services and/or assistance in connecting to community-based 
counseling services; 
• Assistance in connecting to community-based medical services; 
• No contact agreements (agreements between parties to stop all attempts at 
communication or other interaction with one another); 
• Temporarily limiting an individual's access to certain university facilities or activities; 
• Work schedule or job assignment modifications; 
• Information about and/or assistance with obtaining personal protection orders; 
• Leaves of absences; 
• Increased monitoring and security of certain areas of the campus; 
• Individualized limitations on the parties’ communications and interactions with each 
other; or 
• A combination of any of these measures. 
The university will maintain Supportive Measures provided to 
the Complainant or Respondent as confidential to the extent that maintaining such 
confidentiality would not impair the university’s ability to provide the Supportive 
Measures. 

229 
 
 
B. Support and Resources 
All members of the Carnegie Mellon community may seek support and access resources 
on and off-campus that are available at no cost. The Office for Institutional Equity and 
Title IX can assist individuals in accessing these resources or individuals may contact the 
departments or organizations directly. 
Some of these resources are designated as confidential. Other resources provide support, 
but may need to involve the Title IX Coordinator and/or the University Police Department. 
Regardless of whether the university determines that Prohibited Conduct occurred, the 
university will offer resources or assistance to Complainants, Respondents, witnesses, and 
other impacted community members after receiving notice of alleged Prohibited Conduct. 
The university will also assist those individuals in identifying and contacting external law 
enforcement agencies and community resources, when desired by the individual. 
1. Confidential Resources 
Carnegie Mellon understands that some individuals impacted by Prohibited Conduct, 
particularly conduct involving sexual violence, may not be ready or may not be willing 
to report through a channel that may lead to an investigation or other university 
action, no matter how discreet. For such individuals, Carnegie Mellon maintains several 
confidential reporting options. 
These resources can provide individuals with assistance, support, and additional 
information. Confidential Resources are prohibited from disclosing confidential 
information unless (1) given permission by the person who disclosed the information; 
(2) there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others; (3) the conduct involves 
suspected abuse of a minor under the age of 18; or (4) as otherwise required or 
permitted by law or court order. Confidential Resources may be required to report 
non-identifying information to CMUPD for crime reporting purposes. 
2. Campus Resources

VI. How a Complaint is Resolved 
A. Filing a Formal Complaint 
A Complainant who chooses to pursue an alternative or formal resolution to address any 
reported Prohibited Conduct must begin by filing a Formal Complaint with the Office for 
Institutional Equity and Title IX. Filing a Formal Complaint will initiate an investigation 
pursuant to the university’s process outlined in Section VI.B below. The university will not 
commence a formal investigation or its resolution process without the Complainant or the 
Title IX Coordinator filing a Formal Complaint. 
A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, 
or by email with submission of a Formal Complaint Form. The Formal Complaint must 
contain the Complainant’s physical or digital signature or otherwise indicate that 
the Complainant is the person filing (if the Complainant is under the age of 18 and not 
enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the University will ordinarily also contact 
the Complainant’s parent or guardian, as permitted by law, to explain the process for filing 
a Formal Complaint). A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint at any time, but significant 
delays between the time an incident occurs and conducting an investigation may impede or 
limit the availability of relevant material and/or availability of witnesses. 
In certain circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may file a Formal Complaint. Whether 
the university will begin an investigation in response to a report under these 
circumstances depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the wishes of 
the Complainant, the nature and scope of the alleged Prohibited Conduct, the risk posed 
to any individual or to the campus community by not proceeding, and/or the University’s 
determination about whether its legal obligations compel it to pursue the resolution of a 
report. 
After a Formal Complaint has been filed, or signed by the Title IX Coordinator, the 
university will commence its investigation and resolution process. In order for the 
allegations set forth in a Formal Complaint to constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, 
at the time of filing a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in or 
attempting to participate in the University’s Programs or Activities. If the Complainant is 
not participating in or attempting to participate in the University’s Programs or 
Activities at the time the Formal Complaint is filed, the Title IX Coordinator will review 

231 
 
 
the Formal Complaint and determine whether to initiate an investigation of Other 
Prohibited Conduct, as specified in Section VI.B below. 
B. Investigation Procedures 
Upon the filing of a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator (or designee) will review 
the Formal Complaint to determine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal 
Rule Sexual Misconduct. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in 
the Formal Complaint, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, the Title IX 
Coordinator must commence an investigation as set forth below. 
If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in the Formal Complaint, if true, 
would not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct but would constitute Other Prohibited 
Conduct, the Title IX Coordinator will review the Formal Complaint to determine whether the 
allegations, if true, significantly impact the University Community, represent a potential 
threat to members of the University Community, or have some other significant connection 
to the University Community. Based on this review, the Title IX Coordinator will have 
discretion to commence an investigation as set forth below. 
Throughout the investigation and adjudication of the Formal Complaint, both the 
Complainant and the Respondent may select an Advisor of their choice. Details 
concerning the role of the Advisor are set forth in the applicable adjudication procedures 
under Section VI.C and Section VI.E of this Policy. The role of an Advisor in any hearing 
may vary based on the applicable adjudication procedures. 
After deciding to commence an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will appoint an 
investigator to review, assess and investigate the Formal Complaint (the “Investigator”). 
The Investigator may be a staff member in the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX, a 
staff member in Human Resources, a staff member in another department at the 
university, or an external professional. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for ensuring 
that the Investigator has been appropriately trained and is free of conflicts of interest or 
bias that would impair the investigation. 
The Title IX Coordinator will send the Complainant, Respondent and their 
respective Advisors a written notice of investigation. The Investigator will conduct an 
investigation and prepare a preliminary investigative report that fairly summarizes the 
relevant evidence gathered during the investigation. Prior to preparing any report the 
Investigator will request relevant information from the parties as well as work to gather 
other relevant available evidence. Although the ultimate responsibility for gathering 
available evidence rests with the University, the University is unable to compel any person 
to participate in its grievance process. The university cannot access, consider, disclose, or 

232 
 
 
otherwise use a party's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, 
psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the 
professional's or paraprofessional's capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are 
made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party, unless 
the university obtains that party's voluntary, written consent. Throughout the 
investigation the university will provide both parties equal opportunity for the parties to 
present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and 
exculpatory evidence. The parties may offer testimony from an expert witness, as 
specified in Appendix B to this policy. The preliminary investigative report will be made 
available to the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors in electronic or 
hard-copy format. Any evidence collected during the investigation will also be made 
available to the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors for inspection and 
review in electronic or hard-copy format. The Complainant and Respondent will have at 
least ten (10) business days to review and respond to the preliminary investigative report. 
The Investigator will consider any responses submitted by 
the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors and prepare a final 
investigative report (“Investigative Report”). 
The Title IX Coordinator will review the Investigative Report and all relevant evidence to 
determine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct and/or Other Prohibited Conduct. Allegations that would constitute Federal 
Rule Sexual Misconduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.C regarding Adjudication 
Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. Allegations that would constitute Other 
Prohibited Conduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.E regarding Adjudication 
Procedures for Other Prohibited Misconduct. In cases involving multiple allegations which 
include Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other Prohibited Conduct, the university 
reserves the right to decide whether to adjudicate all allegations in a single process under 
the Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct or to separately adjudicate the 
allegations under separate applicable procedures. 
When the university receives a report of alleged conduct that could constitute Prohibited 
Conduct other than Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct) under 
this Policy and could violate other university policies, the university, in its discretion, will 
determine which policy/ies and procedures apply and whether action will be taken under 
multiple policies. 
With regard to Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other Prohibited Conduct, in the 
event that at the time of a report or the conclusion of an investigation it becomes 
apparent that the alleged conduct, if true, would not constitute Federal Rule Sexual 

233 
 
 
Misconduct or Other Prohibited Conduct as defined in this Policy, the matter may be 
adjudicated under another applicable policy or procedure at the university’s discretion. 
For any allegation of Prohibited Conduct that allegedly occurred before the effective date 
of this Policy, the university will use the sexual harassment and/or sexual assault policy 
that was in effect at the time the Prohibited Conduct allegedly occurred for the purpose of 
defining conduct that constitutes a violation of policy. However the matter will be 
investigated and adjudicated using the current procedures as set forth in Section VI of this 
Policy. Complaints where all of the alleged Prohibited Conduct occurred before the 
effective date of this Policy will be adjudicated using the procedures for Other Prohibited 
Conduct set forth in Section VI.E of this Policy. 
C. Adjudication Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct 
Appointment of Hearing Officer 
After reviewing the Investigative Report prepared under Section VI.B above, if the Title IX 
Coordinator determines that the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct, the university will conduct a formal hearing. The Title IX Coordinator will appoint 
a hearing officer (“Hearing Officer”) who will be responsible for presiding over a live hearing 
and making findings of fact and a determination of responsibility with respect to each 
allegation in the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Coordinator and/or Investigator are not 
eligible to serve as the Hearing Officer. 
Conduct of the Hearing & Written Determination 
The Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing in accordance with the Hearing Procedures for 
the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct [pdf]. The hearing will take place no 
sooner than ten days after the parties are provided with the Investigative Report. 
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will make findings of fact and a 
determination of responsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of 
responsibility will be made using the preponderance of evidence standard. 
If the Hearing Officer determines that the Respondent is responsible for any allegation, 
the Hearing Officer will contact the appropriate sanctioning officer, as specified below, to 
review the findings of findings of fact and determination(s) regarding responsibility 
(“Sanctioning Officer”). The Sanctioning Officer will have sole responsibility for 
determining the appropriate sanctions and remedies related to any finding of 
responsibility made by the Hearing Officer. The Sanctioning Officer will provide a written 
determination regarding sanctions to the Hearing Officer. If the Hearing Officer 

234 
 
 
determines that the Respondent is not responsible for any of the allegations, the 
Sanctioning Officer will not be contacted. 
The applicable Sanctioning Officer is based on the nature of the Respondent’s relationship 
to the university: 
• Sanctioning Officer for Students: Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for 
Community Life or designee 
• Sanctioning Officer for Staff: Associate Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer 
or designee 
• Sanctioning Officer for Faculty: Provost or designee 
The Hearing Officer will prepare a written determination regarding the findings of fact and 
the determination regarding responsibility for each allegation. Where applicable, the 
written decision of the Sanctioning Officer regarding sanctions and remedies will be 
attached to or incorporated into the written determination prepared by the Hearing 
Officer. The required content of the written determination of the Hearing Officer is set 
forth in the Hearing Procedures for the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct 
[pdf]. 
Notice of Written Determination 
The written determination will be provided to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX 
Coordinator or designee is responsible for providing the Complainant and Respondent with a 
copy of the written determination. Both parties must be provided the written determination 
simultaneously. 
Additional Procedures for Sanctions Against Faculty Respondents 
In the case of sanctions against a Faculty Respondent, the sanctions determined by the 
Sanctioning Officer for Faculty will be provided to the President as recommended sanctions. 
The President will take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the 
completion of any appeal filed by any party under Section VI.D of this Policy or (ii) the 
deadline to file an appeal under Section VI.D of this Policy passes without any appeal being 
filed. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President’s designee will render a decision on 
the appeal consistent with the procedures in Section VI.D of this Policy. If any sanctions 
remain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed by the appeal deadline, 
the President will thereafter render a decision based on both the recommendation of the 
Sanctioning Officer for Faculty as well as the underlying findings of fact and determination(s) 
of responsibility by the Hearing Officer (or Appeal Officer, if applicable). If the President 
decides to initiate the procedure for dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another 

235 
 
 
sanction against a Faculty Respondent, the matter will then follow the process set forth in the 
subsection "Procedure" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie 
Mellon University titled, "Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions", but will be subject to the 
"Exceptions" provision of that subsection such that no Ad-Hoc Committee will be required. 
D. Appeal Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct 
Both the Complainant and Respondent have the right to file an appeal regarding (i) the 
determination under Section VI.C of this Policy or (ii) the dismissal of a Formal Complaint 
and/or determination that a Formal Complaint does not constitute Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct. An appeal must be submitted in writing to the Office of the President (with a 
copy to the Title IX Coordinator) within seven (7) calendar days of the official notification 
of the determination under Section VI.C. The written appeal request must state the basis 
for the appeal. The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: 
• Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; 
• New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination 
regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the 
matter; 
• The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Sanctioning Officer had a 
conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the 
individual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; and 
• The sanctions imposed are disproportionate to the finding of responsibility. 
The President or the President’s designee will serve as the Appeal Officer. The Appeal 
Officer will inform the other party or parties that an appeal has been filed and provide 
such party or parties with a copy of the written appeal. The non-appealing party will have 
a reasonable, equal opportunity to submit a responsive written statement for 
consideration by the Appeal Officer. 
The Appeal Officer will review the written appeal and any response and determine 
whether, in the judgment of the Appeal Officer, sufficient grounds exist for at least one 
basis of appeal. An appeal that does not meet at least one of the acceptable bases for 
appeal may be dismissed without further review. 
Appeals will be decided by the Appeal Officer in a timely manner as circumstances 
warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the Respondent(s) 
and Complainant(s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline. 

236 
 
 
The Appeal Officer has the authority to modify the decision as they deem appropriate for 
resolution of the matter being appealed, which could entail (i) sending the matter back to 
an Investigator, the Hearing Officer, or a new Hearing Officer, as necessary to remedy the 
error or (ii) a decrease or change to the nature of the sanction(s). The Appeal Officer may 
also remand the matter for a new live hearing under Section VI.C of this Policy. 
The Appeal Officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the 
rationale for the result. The Appeal Officer will provide the written decision 
simultaneously to both the Complainant and Respondent. The Title IX Coordinator will 
also receive a copy of the decision. 
E. Adjudication Procedures for Other Prohibited Conduct 
The specific procedures for adjudicating allegations of Prohibited Conduct that, if true, 
would not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct) are 
based upon the nature of the Respondent’s relationship to the university. 
• Where the Respondent is a Student — the matter will be handled in accordance with 
the university’s Student Community Standards Process, which is set forth in the 
Community Standards section of The Word. Appeals will also be handled in accordance 
with the Student Community Standards Process. 
• Where the Respondent is a Staff member— the Title IX Coordinator will send the 
Investigative Report to the Assistant Vice President, People and Organization 
Effectiveness, in Human Resources and the matter will be handled in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in the Staff Handbook, Volume II, Section 10c. 
• Where the Respondent is a Faculty member — the Title IX Coordinator will send the 
Investigative Report to the Provost who will appoint a Hearing Officer to adjudicate the 
matter. The Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing using the Procedures for Other 
Prohibited Conduct [pdf]. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will 
prepare a written report regarding findings of fact and a determination of 
responsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of responsibility will 
be made using the preponderance of evidence standard. 
The written report of the Hearing Officer will be provided to the Provost. If the report 
of the Hearing Officer includes a determination that the Respondent is responsible for 
any of the allegations, the Provost will make a recommendation to the President 
regarding applicable sanctions and remedies. The report of the Hearing Officer and, if 
applicable, the recommendation of the Provost regarding sanctions will be provided to 
the Complainant, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator. 

237 
 
 
The Complainant and Respondent may appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer 
and/or the sanctions recommended by the Provost to the President. An appeal must 
be submitted in writing to the Office of the President within seven (7) calendar days of 
the notification of the decision of the Hearing Officer to the Complainant and 
Respondent. The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: 
• Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;  
• New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination 
regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of 
the matter;  
• The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Provost had a conflict 
of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the 
individual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; 
and 
• The sanctions recommended by the Provost are disproportionate to the finding of 
responsibility. 
Appeals will be adjudicated by the President or the President’s designee. The President 
or the President’s designee will issue a written decision describing the result of the 
appeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the 
Complainant, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator.  
Where the Provost recommends sanctions against a Faculty member, the President 
will take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the completion of any 
appeal filed by any party (ii) the deadline to file an appeal passes without any appeal 
being filed. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President’s designee will render a 
decision on the appeal and will issue a written decision describing the result of the 
appeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the 
Formal Complaint, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator. 
If any sanctions remain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed 
by the appeal deadline, the President will thereafter render a decision based on both 
the recommendation of the Provost as well as the underlying findings of fact and 
determination(s) of responsibility. If the President decides to initiate the procedure for 
dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction against a Faculty 
Respondent, the matter will then follow the process set forth in the subsection 
"Procedure" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon 

238 
 
 
University titled, "Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions", but will be subject to the 
"Exceptions" provision of that subsection such that no Ad-Hoc Committee will be 
required. 
• Where the Respondent has dual-status (e.g. more than one status as Faculty, Staff or 
Student) — the university has discretion to determine which process to use under 
Section VI.E depending on the circumstances of the case. 
• Where the Respondent is a third party — The university’s ability to take appropriate 
corrective action against a third party will be determined by the nature of the third 
party’s relationship to the university. The Title IX Coordinator will determine the 
appropriate manner of resolution in accordance with the university’s commitment to a 
prompt and equitable process and consistent with state and federal law, regulations, 
guidance, and this Policy. 
F. Possible Outcomes & Sanctions from Adjudication 
Possible outcomes from a violation of this Policy range from educational outcomes to 
separation from the university. A detailed list of the possible remedies and sanctions is 
available in Appendix A to this Policy. 
G. Alternative Resolutions 
This Policy describes two procedures for the formal resolution of Prohibited Misconduct – 
a procedure for the adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct in Section VI.C and a 
procedure for Other Prohibited Conduct in Section VI.E. Separate from these formal 
resolution procedures, the university offers several forms of alternative resolution 
(“Alternative Resolution”) procedures that may be available on a voluntary basis to resolve 
a Formal Complaint under this Policy. 
Individuals interested in an Alternative Resolution should contact the Office for 
Institutional Equity and Title IX to discuss options. For information regarding the types of 
Alternate Resolution procedures that may be available please see Office for Institutional 
Equity and Title IX website. 
Either party may request to pursue an Alternative Resolution at any time after the filing of 
the Formal Complaint and before a finding of responsibility under Section VI.C or Section 
VI.E. The Title IX Coordinator has discretion to determine whether the parties will be 
permitted to pursue an Alternative Resolution. Alternative Resolutions are not available in 
cases involving a Student Complainant and a Faculty or Staff Respondent. In general, 

239 
 
 
mediation and other Alternative Resolution procedures that are similar to mediation will 
not be used to resolve matters involving an allegation of sexual violence (i.e. Sexual 
Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence or any other form of Prohibited Conduct that 
involves the use of violence). 
After receiving a request to pursue an Alternative Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator will 
contact both parties to assess mutual interest in the Alternative Resolution. If both parties 
wish to pursue Alternative Resolution, and the Title IX Coordinator agrees that Alternative 
Resolution is appropriate under the specific facts and circumstances of the case, the Title 
IX Coordinator will provide the Complainant and Respondent with a written notice 
providing (i) the allegations in the Formal Complaint; (ii) the specific Alternative Resolution 
method desired by the parties; (iii) details of the procedures for the Alternative 
Resolution; (iv) a summary of the possible consequences and outcomes of the Alternative 
Resolution, and (v) information regarding the confidentiality and/or accessibility of the 
records of the Alternative Resolution. After receiving this notice, both 
the Complainant and Respondent must provide written consent to the Title IX Coordinator 
in order to proceed with the Alternative Resolution. 
During any Alternative Resolution process, either party has the right to withdraw from the 
process at any time prior to the conclusion of the process. If either party withdraws from 
the Alternative Resolution process or if the parties are unable to successfully resolve the 
matter at the conclusion of the Alternative Resolution process, the matter will proceed to 
investigation under Section VI.B or to adjudication under Section VI.C or Section VI.E, as 
appropriate. 
H. Student Emergency Removal 
Where there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any Students or 
other individuals arising from alleged Prohibited Conduct, the university may remove an 
individual from the University’s Program or Activity and issue any necessary related no-
trespass and no-contact orders during the pendency of the investigation. The university 
will make the decision to remove an individual from the University’s Program or 
Activity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis. 
For Students, an emergency removal decision will be made in accordance with the Safety 
Intervention Protocol set forth in The Word. In the event the university removes any 
person on this basis, the university will provide an opportunity for the affected individual 

240 
 
 
to challenge the removal promptly thereafter, as specified in the Safety Intervention 
Protocol. 
VII. Additional Information about Reporting 
A. How the Title IX Coordinator and University Police Share Information about Prohibited 
Conduct with Each Other 
The university’s process for addressing Prohibited Conduct is separate from the law 
enforcement process for addressing crimes.  
The university strongly believes that the decision as to whether to report a crime should 
be left to the individual(s) impacted by the crime, except in very limited circumstances 
where there may be an immediate threat to the University Community. The Title IX 
Coordinator will share de-identified information about reports with University Police for 
the purpose of complying with the university’s federal reporting obligations to facilitate 
accurate compilation of crime statistics, and to ensure that other public safety 
responsibilities are addressed. In extremely limited circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator 
may share identifying information with University Police, for example, where the 
university is obligated to report a “Timely Warning” pursuant to Jeanne Clery Disclosure of 
Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (e.g., when a crime has been 
committed on or near University Property which represents a serious, ongoing threat 
and/or is part of an ongoing pattern). The report does not constitute a criminal complaint 
to law enforcement, although the University Police Department may contact individuals to 
offer assistance, inquire about their willingness to preserve evidence, or file a criminal 
complaint.  
Making a report to the University Police means that information will be shared with others 
as is necessary and appropriate. For example, if an individual makes a report 
of Prohibited Conduct to the University Police Department that has not already been 
reported to the Title IX Coordinator, the University Police Department will report the 
matter to the Title IX Coordinator. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the 
university can take appropriate actions to seek to eliminate Prohibited Conduct, prevent 
its recurrence, and remedy its effects. The Complainant or others may be contacted by 
the Title IX Coordinator to follow up on the information received from the University 
Police Department to offer supportive measures, including filing a Formal Complaint with 
the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX.  

241 
 
 
B. Time Frame for Reporting an Incident to the University 
The university strongly encourages individuals to report possible Prohibited 
Conduct promptly. Although the university does not limit the time frame for 
reporting Prohibited Conduct, it may be more difficult for the university to gather relevant 
and reliable evidence or to take corrective action regarding conduct that is reported to have 
occurred relatively long ago. 
If the Respondent is no longer a Student, Staff member, Faculty member, or participant in 
any university program or activity at the time of the report, or if the conduct does not fall 
within the scope of the Policy, the university’s ability to take action against the Respondent 
under the Policy may be limited. The university will, however, also help 
a Complainant identify other options outside the university, such as local law 
enforcement, and provide support and resources. 
C. Information on Amnesty to Students When Reporting Prohibited Conduct to the 
University 
The university will not pursue university Prohibited Conduct charges against any Student 
in an investigation under this Policy for potential violations of university policy for 
personal consumption of alcohol or other drugs identified during an investigation, as long 
as any such violations did not and do not place the health or safety of any other person at 
risk. The university may, however, initiate an assessment, educational discussion, or 
pursue other developmental interventions (non-disciplinary options) to address the 
alcohol or other drug use. 
VIII. Obligations of University Employees 
All Carnegie Mellon community members are strongly encouraged to report information 
about potential violations of this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator. Sharing information 
with the Title IX Coordinator does not initiate a formal investigation or impose any 
obligations on the Complainant. However, disclosing information to the Title IX 
Coordinator enables the university to offer supportive measures to the party so that they 
may maintain equal access to their education and work environments. 
Responsible Employees have a heightened obligation to report information of potential 
policy violations. All Staff and Faculty who are Responsible Employees are required to 
promptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all details they receive in the scope of their 
employment about Prohibited Conduct. Responsible Employees can make a report to the 
Title IX Coordinator by contacting the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX. 

242 
 
 
Failure by a Responsible Employees to promptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all 
details they receive, including names of involved parties, in the scope of their employment 
about Prohibited Conduct may subject them to appropriate discipline, up to and including 
removal from their position. 
The following positions are Responsible Employees: 
• University administrators and supervisors; and 
• Employees holding any of the roles or titles list below, including those serving in an 
interim or acting basis: 
Faculty or Staff Administrators 
• President; 
• Provost; 
• Vice-Presidents (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); 
• Vice-Provosts (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); 
• Deans (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); 
• Department Chairs (including those serving in associate and assistant roles, graduate 
chairs, and undergraduate chairs); 
• Directors; and 
• Supervisors (i.e., employees who have authority to hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, 
recall, promote, discharge, reward, or discipline other employees). 
Student Affairs 
• All Staff members (including any individual, whether an employee or not, who serves 
as a coach of a club sports team), excluding administrative assistants, custodial, 
maintenance, and dining employees; and 
• Community Advisors and Resident Assistants in Residential Education. 
Athletics 
• All Staff members, excluding administrative assistants, custodial, maintenance, and 
dining employees. 
University Police 
• All Staff members. 

243 
 
 
Other 
• All Human Resources Staff members (central, school, college, division, and/or unit) who 
are responsible for handling employment issues, excluding clerical and transactional 
employees; 
• All Staff members and Faculty members who provide oversight to or travel with 
Students on university-related travel abroad, including university-sponsored study 
abroad, research, fieldwork, or internship programs. Unless designated as 
a Responsible Employees in another role at the university, staff and Faculty 
members who provide oversight to or travel with Students on university related travel 
abroad, are only considered Responsible Employees with respect to concerns they 
become aware of connected to the program with which they provide oversight or 
travel abroad with Students; and 
• Faculty and Staff members serving as identified advisers to student organizations. 
Confidential Resources, such as individuals employed at CaPS and the University Health 
Center, acting in that capacity, are not Responsible Employees. Nevertheless, these 
individuals can serve as connection points to Supportive Measures through the Office for 
Institutional Equity and Title IX if desired by a party. 
Responsible Employees are not required to report when incidents of Prohibited Conduct 
are communicated/disclosed during a classroom discussion, in an assignment for a class 
(and in discussions outside of class time (e.g., during office hours) related to the 
assignment), or as part of a research project directly associated with the class. 
Responsible Employees also are not required to report information disclosed at sexual 
misconduct public awareness events (e.g., Take Back the Night, candlelight vigils, protests, 
or survivor speak-outs in which participants may disclose incidents of Prohibited 
Conduct). 
If you are unsure of whether you are a Responsible Employee, please contact the Title IX 
Coordinator in order to help clarify your role and responsibilities. 
IX. Definitions 
A. Sexual Misconduct Definitions 
PROHIBITED CONDUCT means one or more categories of prohibited behavior including: 
• Sexual Assault; 

244 
 
 
• Sexual Exploitation; 
• Sexual Harassment; 
• Dating Violence; 
• Domestic Violence; 
• Stalking; 
• Retaliation; and 
• Violation of Protective Measures. 
Definitions for each of the types of Prohibited Conduct are provided below. 
SEXUAL HARASSMENT means any unwelcome conduct or cues of a sexual nature, whether 
verbal/aural (sounds), visual/graphic (e.g. pictures and videos), physical, or otherwise, when: 
• Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition 
of a person’s employment, education, living environment, or participation in any 
University Program or Activity (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); 
• Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for or a 
factor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment, education, living 
environment, or participation in a University Program or Activity (commonly known as 
Quid Pro Quo); and/or 
• Such conduct creates a hostile environment. A hostile environment exists when the 
unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive 
that it unreasonably interferes with an individual’s participation in a university 
program or activity or creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive 
environment for that individual’s participation in a University Program or Activity 
(commonly known as Hostile Environment). 
Examples of conduct that may constitute Sexual Harassment include but are not limited to: 
o Unwanted intentional touching that otherwise does not typically constitute Sexual 
Assault, defined in this Policy; 
o Unwanted sexual advances, including repeated unwanted requests for dates, or 
repeated unwanted requests for sexual contact; 
o Unwanted written, verbal, or electronic statements of a sexual nature, including 
sexually suggestive comments, jokes, videos or innuendos; 

245 
 
 
o Exposing one’s genitalia, breasts, or buttocks, to another; and/or 
o Touching oneself sexually for others to view. 
This definition addresses intentional conduct. It also includes conduct that results in 
negative effects even though such negative effects were unintended. Unwelcome conduct 
of a sexual nature constitutes Sexual Harassment if a Reasonable Person would consider 
it sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive as to interfere unreasonably with academic, 
other educational, or employment performance or participation in a university activity or 
living environment. 
SEXUAL ASSAULT means a physical, sexual act directed against another person without their 
Consent, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving Consent. Sexual Assault 
can occur between two individual of the same or different sexes and/or genders. This 
includes the following: 
I. 
RAPE means the carnal knowledge of a person, without the Consent of the victim, 
including instances where the victim does not have the Capacity to give Consent; 
II. 
SODOMY means oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the 
Consent of the victim, including instances where the victim does not have the 
Capacity to give Consent; 
III. 
SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH AN OBJECT means to use an object or instrument to 
unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of 
another person, without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the 
victim does not have the Capacity to give Consent; 
IV. 
FONDLING means the touching of the private body parts of another person for the 
purpose of sexual gratification, where the victim does not have the Capacity to give 
Consent; 
V. 
INCEST means sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other 
within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law; or 
VI. 
STATUTORY RAPE means sexual intercourse with a person who is under the 
statutory age of Consent in the applicable jurisdiction.  
In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16. 
Minors aged 16 years of age or older can legally consent to sexual activity with 
anyone they choose, as long as the other person does not have authority over them 
as defined in Pennsylvania’s institutional sexual assault statute. Minors under the 
age of 13 cannot consent to sexual activity. Minors aged 13-15 years old cannot 

246 
 
 
consent to sexual activity with anyone who is 4 or more years older than they are at 
the time of the activity. 
DATING VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, or 
the threat of such violence, committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship 
of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim and where the existence of such a 
relationship is determined based on a consideration of the length, type, and frequency of 
interactions between the persons involved in the relationship. 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, 
or the threat of such violence, committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner 
of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is 
cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a 
person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws 
of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth 
victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of 
the jurisdiction. 
STALKING means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would 
cause a Reasonable Person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or suffer 
substantial emotional distress. 
SEXUAL EXPLOITATION  
means intentionally or knowingly taking sexual advantage of another person or violating the 
sexual privacy of another when Consent is not present. This includes, but is not limited to, 
the following actions (including when they are done via electronic means, methods or 
devices): 
• engaging in sexual voyeurism including observing or permitting others to witness or 
observe the sexual or intimate activity (e.g., disrobing, bathing, toileting) of another 
person without that person’s Consent; 
• engaging in indecent exposure, or exposing intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, 
breasts and/or buttocks), or causing another to expose intimate parts when Consent is 
not present; 
• recording or distributing information, images or recordings of any person engaged in 
sexual or intimate activity in a private space without that person’s Consent; 
• prostituting another individual; 

247 
 
 
• causing Incapacitation of another person (through alcohol, drugs or other means) for 
the purpose of compromising that person’s ability to give Consent to non-consensual 
sexual activity; or 
• actively aiding or assisting another person in committing an act of Prohibited Conduct. 
RETALIATION means an adverse (negative) action taken against a person for making a 
good faith report of Prohibited Conduct, being alleged to have committed Prohibited 
Conduct, participating, or refusing to participate, in any proceeding under this Policy. 
• Retaliation may include intimidation, threats, coercion, harassment, or discrimination 
(including charging a Respondent under a different university policy instead of this 
Policy for the purpose of interfering with any right or privileged secured by Title IX or 
its implementing regulations). 
• Retaliation may also include adverse employment or educational actions that would 
discourage a Reasonable Person from engaging in a Protected Activity protected under 
this Policy. 
A finding of retaliation under this Policy is not dependent on a finding that the underlying 
sexual misconduct occurred. Retaliation is also prohibited by the university’s Policy Against 
Retaliation. 
Supportive Measures and other actions taken in accordance with this or other university 
policies generally do not constitute Retaliation. Similarly, charging an individual with a code of 
conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a 
grievance proceeding under this Policy does not constitute prohibited Retaliation, provided, 
however, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that 
any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. Retaliation also does not include 
pursuit of civil, criminal, or other legal action, internal or external to the university. 
PROTECTED ACTIVITY means participating in the university’s processes related to this 
Policy, including but not limited to reporting Prohibited Conduct; pursuing a resolution of 
Prohibited Conduct; providing evidence in any investigation or hearing; or intervening to 
protect others who may have suffered Prohibited Conduct. 
B. Definitions Relating to Consent 
CONSENT means a knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity at the 
time of the activity. In order to be valid, consent must be knowing, voluntary, active, 

248 
 
 
present and ongoing. Consent should be demonstrated through mutually understandable 
words or actions. 
• Silence, remaining still or inactive (passive), or not actively resisting sexual activity does 
not imply consent. 
• Consent to engage in one sexual activity does not mean consent to engage in another 
sexual activity. Consent must be obtained each time, at each step of sexual activity. 
• Prior consent does not mean future consent. Consent must be obtained each time, at 
each step of sexual activity, even for those in an ongoing sexual relationship. 
• Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If one individual withdraws consent through 
clear words or actions, the other person must cease sexual activity immediately. 
• Consent cannot be obtained through Force, Incapacitation or Coercion (as defined 
here in). 
FORCE means using physical control (such as restraining a person), physical violence (such 
as hitting, choking or displaying a weapon), or threats of either to cause a person to 
submit to unwanted sexual activity. 
COERCION means using an unreasonable amount of pressure or threats that would 
overcome the will of a Reasonable Person and cause them to submit to unwanted sexual 
activity. Coercion requires more than an attempt to persuade someone to engage in 
sexual activity. Coercion can include threats, such as threats to cause academic, 
employment, reputational or economic harm. When one person expresses that they do 
not consent to sexual activity or are withdrawing consent for sexual activity, applying 
continued pressure in order to get the person to submit to unwanted sexual activity can 
be considered Coercion. 
INCAPACITATION means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, deliberate 
choices about whether or not to engage in sexual activity. A person is Incapacitated — 
unable to give consent — because they are: 
• under the age of consent (generally 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see definition of 
Statutory Rape for additional information); 
• physically or mentally helpless; 
• asleep or unconscious; or 
• unaware that sexual activity was requested, suggested, initiated and/or is taking place. 

249 
 
 
A person may be Incapacitated by the use of alcohol or other drugs. Incapacitation is a state 
beyond intoxication or drunkenness. A person is not necessarily Incapacitated solely as a result 
of drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the 
person unable to give Consent. 
For example, a person who is Incapacitated may not be able to answer some or all of the 
following questions: 
o Do you know where you are?  
o Do you know how you got here?  
o Do you know what is happening?  
o Do you know whom you are with? 
A person who is Incapacitated may also demonstrate physical signs including but not limited to: 
o slurred or incomprehensible speech; 
o unsteady manner of walking or inability to walk; 
o vomiting or incontinence (a lack of voluntary control over urination and/or defecation). 
If a person under the influence of alcohol or drugs decides to participate in sexual activity that 
they would not participate in while sober, it does not necessarily mean that the person was 
Incapacitated or that the Consent was not valid. 
Importantly, being impaired by alcohol or other drugs is not a defense to a failure to obtain 
Consent. 
CAPACITY means that the person has the ability under the law to give Consent to engage 
in sexual activity. This means that the person must be: 
• Of legal age to give Consent (generally at least 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see 
definition of Statutory Rape for additional information); and 
• Able to make informed, deliberate choices about whether or not to engage in sexual 
activity. 
A person who is not able to give consent is considered to be Incapacitated. 
C. Policy Definitions 
ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE means that the university has notice of alleged Sexual Misconduct 
because the alleged misconduct has been reported to the Title IX Coordinator or any 
official of the university who has the authority to institute corrective measures on behalf 

250 
 
 
of the university. These are individuals whose “actual knowledge” may be imputed to the 
university. 
ADVISOR: An individual who provides support and advice for the Complainant or 
Respondent. The Complainant and Respondent may have an Advisor of their choice, who 
may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. 
If either party does not have an Advisor present at the live hearing conducted under 
Section VI.C, the university will provide, without fee or charge to that party, a substitute 
Advisor of the university’s choice who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. In 
this event, the role of the Advisor provided by the university will be limited to the 
conducting of cross examination on behalf of the party that did not have an Advisor. 
COMPLAINANT: In most circumstances, Complainant means a person who is reported to 
have experienced Prohibited Conduct. The term Complainant also includes such 
individuals who file a Formal Complaint and who participates in a process undertaken by 
the university to address the report of Prohibited Conduct (including Federal Rule Sexual 
Misconduct). In some cases, a Complainant may be different than the person who initially 
reports information to the university. 
EMPLOYEE: person who is employed by the university to perform one or more of the 
following roles: regular instructional faculty, supplemental instructional faculty, research 
track faculty, visiting faculty, librarians, archivists, curators, graduate student instructors, 
graduate student staff assistants, graduate student research assistants, postdoctoral 
research fellows, and all regular and temporary staff. 
FACULTY/FACULTY MEMBER means all individuals who hold appointments on the tenure-
track, research-track, teaching-track, librarian/archivist-track and special faculty track of 
the university, as well as individuals holding Emeritus Faculty status. 
FEDERAL RULE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT is a subset of Prohibited Conduct which meets the 
definition of Sexual Harassment in the Title IX Regulations at 34 CFR Part 106.30. 
Something which meets the definition of category of Prohibited Conduct (defined above) 
rises to the level of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct when it meets ALL of the following 
three conditions: 
• The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and 
• The conduct took place within the University’s Programs or Activities. 
PLUS one or more of the following conditions: 

251 
 
 
i. An Employee engages in Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment against a Student; and/or 
ii. An individual engages in hostile environment Sexual Harassment that is so severe, 
pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies another person equal access to 
the University’s Programs or Activities; and/or 
iii. An individual engages in Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or 
Stalking. 
FORMAL COMPLAINT means a written or typed document, signed by the Complainant or 
the Title IX Coordinator (electronically or otherwise), which requests that the university 
initiate the procedures outlined in Section VI. If the Complainant is under the age of 18 
and not enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the Complainant’s parent or 
guardian must sign the Formal Complaint. 
OTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT means any Prohibited Conduct that does not meet the 
definition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. 
REASONABLE PERSON a person using average care, intelligence, and judgment in the 
known circumstances. 
REPORT means information shared with the university’s Title IX Coordinator about one or 
more incidents of Prohibited Conduct which have occurred (or is continuing to occur) and 
which: 
• has impacted (or continues to impact) one or more members of the University 
Community; and/or 
• was or is committed by one or more members of the University Community; and/or 
• occurred or is occurring on property owned or controlled by the University or within 
the University’s Programs or Activities.  
RESPONDENT: an individual who is reported to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct 
(including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct). 
RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEE: an individual who is required to report information of alleged 
Prohibited Misconduct (including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct) to the university’s Title 
IX Coordinator. The categories of “Responsible Employee” includes: 
1. University administrators and supervisors; and 
2. Employees in certain designated positions and units or departments. 
A Responsible Employee is required to share all relevant information about the alleged 
Prohibited Conduct, of which they are aware, with the Title IX Coordinator within 48 

252 
 
 
hours of learning them. Relevant information includes (to the extent known by the 
Responsible Employee):  
a. Name (or names) of the Complainant(s); 
b. Name (or names) of Respondent(s); 
c. Details about the nature of the alleged Prohibited Conduct; and 
d. Any information available about location(s), date(s), and/or time(s). 
A full list of Responsible Employees and more information about a Responsible 
Employee’s obligations can be found in Section VIII. 
A Responsible Employee’s receipt of information about alleged Prohibited Conduct (including 
Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct) will not automatically trigger a formal resolution under this 
Policy. The university will only commence Formal Resolution upon receipt of a Formal 
Complaint signed by the Complainant or the Title IX Coordinator. 
STAFF/STAFF MEMBER means all Employees of the university who do not hold faculty 
appointments. Staff does not include individuals whose primary relationship with the 
university is as a Student. 
STUDENT a person who was selected by the university for part-time, full-time, special, 
associate, transfer, exchange, or any other enrollment, membership, or matriculation in 
or at any of the University’s Programs or Activities. 
UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY refers to university Students, Faculty and Staff. 
UNIVERSITY'S PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES: Conduct takes place in the “University’s 
Programs or Activities” when that conduct occurs: (1) in a location, at an event, or in a 
circumstance where the university exercises substantial control over both the Respondent 
and the context in which the conduct occurs; or (2) in any building owned or controlled by 
a student organization recognized by the university. 
Examples: Conduct that occurs on-campus occurs within the University’s Programs or 
Activities. Conduct that occurs off campus in locations or at events with no connection to 
the university is unlikely to occur in a program or activity of the university. 
VIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES 
Any violation of an agreement or order that limits an individual’s contact or interactions 
with another individual. Such agreement or order may have been issued under the 
authority of the university, another institution, or a local, state or federal government or 
court. 

253

Smoke-less Campus Policy 
Policy Rationale 
The university is committed to promoting a safe, healthy working and learning 
environment. This commitment extends to encouraging and supporting the reduction of 
significant health risks to members of the community. Smoking of tobacco products is one 
such risk. This Policy is intended not only to relieve community members from negative 
effects of tobacco smoking by others, but also to promote and assist smoking cessation 
by existing users and discourage new addictions. 
Policies that strictly regulate smoking have been demonstrated to reduce exposure to 
second-hand smoke, tobacco-related death and disease, and attendant healthcare costs. 
In addition, several systematic reviews of studies have demonstrated effectiveness of 
such policies in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use, increasing the number of tobacco 
users who quit, and reducing the initiation of tobacco use among young people. These 
positive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke-free 
policy intervention. Benchmarking suggests that a “smoke-less” approach, an alternative 
to prohibition that honors our campus geography and is grounded in sustained and 
visible efforts to reduce smoking and promote cessation, can also have positive effects. 
The effects of exposure to smoke from tobacco were documented in the 2006, 2010, and 
2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Reports. Further research is needed to determine the public 
health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and other novel nicotine products. Although 
harmful consequences of e-cigarette vapor have not been demonstrated to the standards 

257 
 
 
used for conventional cigarettes, the practice of using these products may have social 
impact. In addition, some state and local governments, including Allegheny County, have 
passed laws regulating the use of e-cigarettes. Therefore, this Policy addresses both the 
smoking of tobacco products and the use of e-cigarettes. As evidence becomes more 
conclusive, this Policy may be amended to further address novel nicotine products. 
Policy Statement 
Smoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all university buildings and facilities owned, 
leased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus vehicles. Smoking of 
tobacco products is also prohibited on all grounds and outside areas except for limited 
designated outdoor areas where the negative effects of second-hand exposure is deemed 
sufficiently low. As such, major campus thoroughfares, gathering spaces and entrances to 
buildings are not designated areas. The number, nature and location of designated areas 
was determined by an oversight committee convened by the university’s Environmental 
Health & Safety department and comprised of representatives from Faculty Senate, 
Graduate Student Assembly, Staff Council and Student Senate. 
• Designated Smoking Areas [pdf] 
• Tobacco Cessation Resources [pdf] 
Use of e-cigarettes and vaporizers is prohibited inside all university buildings and inside all 
property owned, leased or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, but is not prohibited 
outside on campus grounds as of the adoption of this Policy. 
For the purpose of this Policy, a tobacco product is defined as any product made or 
derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption by smoking. Examples of 
tobacco products include, but are not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, and pipe 
tobacco. 
For the purpose of this Policy, an e-cigarette is defined as any electronic oral device, such 
as one composed of a heating element, battery or electronic circuit, which provides a 
vapor of nicotine or any other substances and the use or inhalation of which simulates 
smoking. The term shall include any such device, whether manufactured, distributed, 
marketed or sold as an e-cigarette, e-cigar or e-pipe or under any other product name or 
descriptor. 
This Policy does not apply to the use of tobacco products, e-cigarettes or vaporizers for 
official academic research so long as such use of these products complies with all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws. 

258 
 
 
Social Regulations 
Events that are in any way identified with Carnegie Mellon and are conducted by students 
or student organizations for purely social purposes are covered by the following 
regulations: 
• Any such event, whether on or off campus, must comply with city, state and federal 
laws. Carnegie Mellon accepts no responsibility for the direct supervision of the social 
activities engaged in by its students and student organizations. 
• Student organizations must submit this form to the Director of Student Leadership, 
Involvement and Civic Engagement for review and approval prior to any events being 
held during final examinations, during final examinations, on the night before any 
recess, or during any recess of more than three days duration. 
• It is expected that students will organize and conduct social activities in a responsible 
manner. 
• The university reserves the right to review the planning for social events requiring the 
use of university facilities and to establish special requirements as needed to ensure 
the well-being of all students. 
Last revised Spring 1998. 
Statement of Assurance Policy 
The Statement of Assurance must be placed in all graduate and undergraduate admissions 
publications and all other publications where such a statement is necessary or appropriate. 
Also, the Carnegie Mellon Writer's Style Guide gives detailed guidance on how to use the 
statement of assurance in campus-related publications.

Steam Tunnels 
Because of the danger to all who enter them, the steam tunnels are locked and anyone 
found in the tunnels will be subject to serious disciplinary action and/or criminal action. The 
University Police are responsible for keeping the tunnels locked and apprehending anyone 
who trespasses in them. 
Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures 
Please refer to the current Student Financial Obligation Statement. That statement is 
provided to all students through the Student Information Online (SIO). Questions about this 
statement may be directed to The HUB. 
Student Damage to Carnegie Mellon Property Policy 
Students will be charged with the cost of restoring to its proper condition any Carnegie 
Mellon property that, through their negligence or misuse, has been damaged. 
Responsible parties will be subject to disciplinary action if said damages are found to have 
been intentional or caused as a result of improper behavior. All such damages should be 
reported promptly to the Campus Police. 
When individual responsibility cannot be assigned, the members of the group to whom a 
space has been assigned or property supplied may be charged (as individuals) for the cost of 
repairs, and may be subject to disciplinary action. 
Student Enterprises 
Students who wish to form a student-run business or enterprise must submit a proposal in 
writing for approval by the dean of student affairs, the vice president for campus affairs and 
chief financial officer. Any approved enterprise will be required to pay a university overhead 
charge, which will be determined in negotiations with the Division of Finance. 
Student Health Insurance Policy 
Policy Rationale 
The cost of health care in the United States presents a potentially serious health risk and 
financial risk to students and their accompanying dependents. The absence of adequate 
health insurance coverage is a barrier to care that can result in temporary or permanent 

260 
 
 
interruption of a student’s education. The university is committed to offering student 
health insurance that provides access to quality health care and achieves a balance 
between premium cost and adequate coverage without overburdening students’ financial 
resources. This balance is best achieved through a student health insurance requirement 
that mitigates the effect of adverse selection while providing another option for coverage.  
Policy Statement 
All full-time students are required to carry health insurance that meets certain standards 
of coverage.  In the absence of adequate health insurance coverage, the student is 
required to enroll in the student health insurance plan. 
Implementation Guidelines 
The process for selection of vendors for the student health insurance plan shall adhere to 
institutional requirements relative to competitive vendor selection processes. The student 
health insurance program shall be reviewed annually by University Health Services (UHS) 
and student consumers including representatives from Student Senate and the Graduate 
Student Assembly to ensure that the program meets the needs of covered individuals, 
provides the desired level of benefit at the least possible cost and returns as much of the 
premium to covered individuals in the form of benefits as possible. 
The health insurance program shall be available to all eligible students without regard to 
race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, pre-existing medical or mental 
health condition or genetic information. 
All full-time students will be assessed a charge for the individual basic health insurance 
plan offered through the university student health insurance program. The charge will 
appear on the invoice of the first semester of attendance in the academic cycle.  The 
student is expected to actively enroll in the plan or apply for a waiver from the student 
insurance plan during the open enrollment. Failure to take action will result in automatic 
enrollment in the student health insurance plan. 
Application or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be determined 
by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with relevant colleagues in 
those locations. 
Requirements for Waiver 
Application for waiver from the university student health insurance plan must be 
submitted to UHS by the last day of the open enrollment period.  Students applying for 
waiver must provide documentation of: 

261 
 
 
• Coverage by a carrier that has offices based in the U.S. 
• Continuing coverage that verifies enrollment as the dependent, partner/spouse or 
principal in an employer, state or federally operated insurance Exchange or 
government sponsored insurance plan. 
• Enrollment in a plan that meets certain minimum standards for coverage as set forth 
by the university including but not limited to an adequate level of coverage for 
medical, mental health and substance abuse services at the primary, emergency, 
inpatient and outpatient level in the geographic location of study. 
Failure to maintain continuous coverage will result in automatic enrollment in the student 
health insurance standard plan. 
Unauthorized Possession of Keys 
Students found using or having in their possession key(s) or key card(s) to any university 
doors or facilities that they are unauthorized to use or possess will be subject to disciplinary 
action. 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)/Drones 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), including aircraft commonly known as drones, are used at 
Carnegie Mellon University in a variety of ways related to academics, research, business and 
recreation. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community and guests on university property 
are expected to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the 
operation of UAS. In particular, all outdoor UAS operations must comply with Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) regulations. Indoor UAS operation is not regulated by the FAA.

Any person who makes threats or engages in violent behavior while on property owned or 
controlled by the university may be removed from the premises as quickly as safety 
permits. They may be required to remain off university premises pending the outcome of 
an investigation. Any university student, faculty or staff member who violates this policy 
will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with university policies and procedures 
applicable to students, faculty and staff. 
It is recognized that there may be activities related to the educational mission of the 
university (e.g., physical fitness activities or theatrical productions) that may appear to 
violate the letter but not the intent of this Policy. In such cases, the department or 
organization coordinating the activity is responsible for obtaining written approval from 
the Chief of Police or his designee, in advance, to conduct the activity. Such approval may 
extend for up to one year at a time. 

264

Carnegie Mellon University is committed to cultivating an environment that supports the 
personal and intellectual growth of each student by promoting our traditions of innovation, 
leadership, responsibility to society, learning, dedication, commitment to quality and 
commitment to each other. We are a community with high expectations for those who choose to 
become members, including established community standards intended to foster behavior that 
is consistent with an educational setting where each member can achieve their full potential 
Community Standards Overview 
It is the responsibility of each community member to become familiar with the standards and 
expectations of the Carnegie Mellon community. In general, each member should: 
• Respect the rights of others; 
• Respect the property of individuals, groups and Carnegie Mellon; 
• Know, understand and abide by all Carnegie Mellon community standards, policies and 
regulations, as well as all local, state and federal laws; 
• Engage in behavior that does not interfere with individual, group or Carnegie Mellon regular 
activities and/or operation; 
• Ensure that guests behave in a manner consistent with and in accordance with the 
expectations of our community. 
At the core, our standards, policies and procedures are designed to: 
• promote and protect the rights of all members and guests of our community; 
• promote and protect the health and safety of all members and guests of our community; 
• promote the respect of and protect community members’ and University property; 
• promote and protect the academic integrity of our community. 
The Word provides a list of policies students are expected to uphold and the process by which 
violations will be addressed. Policies and procedures may be established or amended as 
necessary during the course of the academic year, which will become effective immediately 
upon notification by the dean of students. 
In all cases involving infractions of community standards (excluding the adjudication of Federal 
Rule Sexual Misconduct under Section VI.C of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) the 
following procedures will be used: 

268 
 
 
1. 
The Resolution Review Board will review the case and determine the appropriate venue for 
resolution.    
2. 
When appropriate, an Administrative Resolution Meeting will take place with a university 
adjudicator. If the student respondent and the university adjudicator can resolve the 
matter, the student will be notified in writing of the determined action once said action is 
approved by the Resolution Review Board. 
3. 
When the University Disciplinary Committee is assigned original jurisdiction or when 
Administrative Resolution has failed, the procedures outlined in the Conduct of University 
Disciplinary Committee Hearings will apply. 
A student who requires accommodations due to a disability in order to full participate in the 
community standards process should contact the Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability 
Resources which provides responsive and reasonable accommodations to students who self-
identify as having a disability, including physical, sensory, cognitive and emotional disabilities. 
The university’s policy on Student Accommodations is available at 
https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/policies-guidelines/. Additional information regarding 
the Office of Disability Resources, including how to request accommodations, is available at 
https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/. 
Community Standards Violations 
The following are groups of violations that constitute misconduct for which members of the 
student body may be held accountable. This list references policies that may be outlined in 
greater detail in this on-line handbook or other campus resources. The university is not limited 
by this list nor by other published policies when it initiates community standards actions since it 
is not possible to anticipate all of the behavior of a college population.  Additionally, University 
departments and units may maintain specific policies or guidelines enforceable by their 
respective procedures separate from community standards action (e.g. University Libraries, 
Transportation Services, Environmental Health and Safety, Office for Institutional Equity and Title 
IX, etc.).  
The university reserves the right to review off-campus incidents to determine if a violation of 
community standards has occurred and whether resolution through the appropriate process is 
warranted.     
 

269

reviewed through the university community standards process. Examples of violations of 
community standards in relation to health, safety and security include, but are not limited to: 
• Disorderly or disruptive behavior 
• Failure to comply with a reasonable request of a university official 
• Failure to comply with a request to produce identification 
• Failure to comply with university public health requirements or instructions 
• Failure to evacuate for fire drills and alarms 
• Harboring of an unauthorized animal(s) 
• Improper storage of chemicals, gases or hazardous materials 
• Installation of a private locking system 
• Possession or use of false identification 
• Tampering with or misuse of fire safety equipment 
• Unauthorized and/or unlawful recording 
• Unauthorized entry into secured spaces 
• Unauthorized use of appliances 
• Use of pyrotechnics, fireworks or hazardous devices 
• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Alcohol and Drug Policy 
• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Personal Wheeled Vehicle Transportation Policy 

272 
 
 
• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Housing Services Policies 
• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Deadly Weapons 
• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Freedom of Expression 
• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Smoke-Less Campus Policy 
Important Definitions 
• Adjudicator – University official authorized to resolve allegations or impose outcomes for 
students alleged to have violated community standards. This person is usually a housefellow 
or college liaison, but the dean of students or designee may also act as an adjudicator. 
• Complainant – The person(s) or group bringing allegations forward in the community 
standards process. In cases where there is no individual bringing forward an allegation, the 
university may act as complainant. Further, in cases where there is a community member 
bringing forward an allegation, a university official may serve as co-complainant where the 
university determines that a broader community interest exists to safeguard the welfare of 
the university community and when the potential outcome in such a case could include 
separation from the university. 
• Hearing Officer – The Hearing Officer is appointed by the dean of students or designee. A 
Hearing Officer may be an employee of Carnegie Mellon, or a third party engaged by the 
university, who has been trained to serve in this role. The Hearing Officer is responsible for 
conducting the hearing, making a determination regarding relevancy of information as well 
as responsibility for each allegation. If applicable, the Hearing Officer will recommend 
outcomes to the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for Community Life.  
• Moderator – The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates a University Disciplinary 
Committee hearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community 
Standards & Integrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines. 
• Process Advisor – As a member of the team in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity, 
the Process Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening a University Disciplinary 
Committee. The Process Advisor schedules the hearing, assembles the hearing board, 
informs the complainant(s) and respondent(s) of the procedures for the hearing, and 
manages other administrative tasks. 
• Resolution – Typically, the result of a complaint being adjudicated through the community 
standards process which may entail administrative resolution or the University Disciplinary 

273 
 
 
Committee. However, a complaint may be resolved informally outside of the community 
standards process at the discretion of the dean of students or designee and the individuals 
involved in the matter. 
• Resolution Review Board – The team of designated and trained staff that reviews and 
approves initial allegations and determines appropriate venues for resolution through the 
community standards process. The Resolution Review Board also reviews and approves 
proposed outcomes stemming from Administrative Resolution Meetings. 
• Respondent – The person(s), group, or student organization alleged to have violated 
community standards. 
• Student – Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon 
University at the time of the alleged violation. For community standards purposes, an 
individual is also considered to be a student if they have accepted their offer of admission 
and are not yet enrolled. Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled 
but not taking classes due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other 
personal leave; students who were enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who 
demonstrate an intent to enroll by registering for courses; and students participating in study 
abroad programs. 
• Support Person – A person of the student's choosing who accompanies the student to any 
meeting related to the community standards process, including a University Disciplinary 
Committee hearing. The role of the support person is limited to supporting the student in 
meetings or a hearing. Support persons may not actively participate in meetings, the hearing 
process or communicate on the student's behalf.  
• Witness – Individuals positioned to provide direct information related to the alleged 
violations being reviewed by the University Disciplinary Committee, such as direct 
observation of the incident in question and/or direct interaction with  
The Community Standards Process 
Staff members in the Division of Student Affairs adjudicate alleged violations of community 
standards by students through the community standards process. The following forums exist for 
formal resolution of alleged violations: 
• Administrative Resolution Meeting with a university adjudicator 
• University Disciplinary Committee (UDC) 

274 
 
 
• Hearing Officer 
• Academic Review Board (ARB) 
 For incidents that pose immediate concerns for the safety and welfare of the campus 
community, during the tendency of university community standards proceedings, the university 
may conduct a review per the Safety Intervention Protocol to determine whether it is necessary 
to take summary action or implement interim measures that limit a student's ability to be 
present on campus, engage in coursework, and/or interact with specific members of the 
university community until resolution is reached. 
Additionally, when circumstances warrant, the dean of students or designee may modify these 
procedures to ensure the safety and welfare of the campus community. 
Initiating the Community Standards Process 
In order to initiate the community standards process, the Office of Community Standards & 
Integrity must receive a complaint or report that substantiates the facts and circumstances 
associated with any alleged violation(s) of community standards by a Carnegie Mellon 
student. The initial information for the complaint or report may be provided by a student, 
faculty, staff member, or non-affiliate directly to the Office of Community Standards & 
Integrity or via the following: 
• Campus Security Authority (as defined in the university’s Annual Security and Fire Safety 
Report); 
• Carnegie Mellon University’s Ethics Reporting Hotline; 
• Carnegie Mellon University’s Bias Reporting Resources; 
• Carnegie Mellon University Police Department; 
• City of Pittsburgh Police and/or other law enforcement agency; 
• Information Security Office; or 
• Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX. 
The Office of Community Standards & Integrity has the authority to review and adjudicate all 
violations of university standards, policies and regulations that involve students. The 
university community standards process may not be used for the adjudication of cases 
involving the relationships or interactions between two parties that do not involve alleged 
violations of community standards. Additionally, a complaint may be resolved informally 

275 
 
 
outside of the community standards process at the discretion of the dean of students or 
designee and with the agreement of the individuals involved in the matter. 
As needed the Resolution Review Board (RRB) is empowered to review initial complaints and 
determine whether there is a reasonable basis for resolution via the community standards 
process.  When reviewing a complaint, the Resolution Review Board will consider if the 
described behavior could violate a University policy or community standard if shown to be 
true. The RRB may determine the described behavior does not constitute a violation of 
community standards or the complaint does not contain enough information to make such a 
determination and may request additional information or further investigation. The RRB may 
dismiss a complaint when it is determined there is no reasonable basis for resolution via the 
community standards process. Complaints that are dismissed may be resolved via an 
informal process including, but not limited to, conflict coaching, facilitating a dialogue, 
mediation, restorative practices, or shuttle diplomacy. 
Student organizations, as members of the academic community, are expected to uphold 
university policies and community standards. Alleged violations of community standards 
associated with student organization activities may be reviewed through the community 
standards process. Individual students may be held accountable through the community 
standards process separate from any sanctions imposed on an organization found 
responsible for violating community standards. 
Withdrawal of a Complaint 
Generally, when pending allegations are withdrawn by the complainant, the allegations 
may not be refiled unless new information becomes available that was not previously 
available. The refiled complaint will be reviewed by the Resolution Review Board to 
determine if the allegations should move forward based on the current 
circumstances.  For allegations of sexual misconduct involving student respondents under 
Section VI.E of the sexual misconduct policy (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct), this 
withdrawal of complaint rule applies only after the final investigative report is provided to 
the Office of Community Standards & Integrity for adjudication through the community 
standards process.   
Engagement Expectations 
It is an expectation that students involved in the community standards process make a 
good faith effort to participate and bring the matter to resolution. 
If a Complainant ceases to engage in the resolution process, the Resolution Review Board 
may elect to dismiss the allegations or the RRB may allow the allegations to proceed with 

276 
 
 
a university official serving as the Complainant.  Allegations dismissed by RRB may not be 
refiled by the Complainant unless new information is available that was not previously 
available. 
If a Respondent ceases to participate in the process, the university may proceed to make a 
determination via Administrative Resolution or schedule and conduct a University 
Disciplinary Committee without that student's participation. 
Overriding Community Interest in Community Standards Matters 
There are some circumstances in which an overriding community interest will necessitate 
engagement of the community standards process even if the impacted party does not 
wish to pursue it as a means of resolution. 
The Office of Community Standards & Integrity in consultation with the Resolution Review 
Board will determine if an overriding community interest exists. The Title IX Coordinator 
will play a key role in determining the existence of an overriding community interest in 
cases involving alleged violations of the Carnegie Mellon Sexual Misconduct Policy 
(Interim). 
In circumstances where an impacted party does not wish to pursue action through the 
community standards process and it is determined that an overriding community interest 
exists, the University will bring the matter for review via the community standards 
process. The impacted party will be informed of this decision as well as their options for 
participation in the resolution process. 
Administrative Resolution Meeting 
A student is expected to meet with a university adjudicator to attempt to resolve alleged 
violation(s) of university community standards. A successful administrative resolution 
meeting will include the following:  
1. 
The facts must be determined. The student must agree that essential facts related to the 
incident are undisputed. 
2. 
A violation of community standards must be determined. The student must agree that 
what occurred during the incident was a violation of the university's community 
standards. 
3. 
A proposed outcome or set of outcomes must be determined. The student and 
adjudicator must jointly agree about what outcome or set of outcomes will be proposed 

277 
 
 
for resolution of the matter, taking into account where appropriate the concerns of the 
reporting party. 
The aforementioned proposed outcome or set of outcomes will be reviewed by the 
Resolution Review Board. If approved, the student will receive notification in writing 
confirming the determined action, which then becomes final. If agreement on the 
appropriate action cannot be reached, the matter may be referred to the University 
Disciplinary Committee for review. 
 
Should a student be non-responsive to notification of an alleged violation of the university's 
community standards, after a reasonable period of time and having made reasonable 
attempts to contact the Respondent, the university adjudicator may make a determination 
regarding responsibility and assign restorative outcomes and/or a period of disciplinary 
probation based on the information available. Consistent with Administrative Resolution 
procedures, this determination will be forwarded to the Resolution Review Board for 
approval. Violations that may result in disciplinary suspension and where the student is non-
responsive will be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee for resolution. 
University Disciplinary Committee 
The University Disciplinary Committee has jurisdiction in the following cases: 
1. 
Any cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies that the Resolution 
Review Board deems sufficiently serious in nature or inappropriate for administrative 
resolution. 
2. 
Any cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies in which one 
student(s) is filing allegation against another student(s) that cannot be appropriately 
resolved through the administrative resolution process. 
3. 
Appeals referred by the dean of students or designee to review summary actions 
imposed by a university adjudicator or university staff member.  
4. 
Cases in which administrative resolution has not been successful. 
When circumstances warrant, at the discretion of the Dean of Students or designee, a case 
may be reviewed by a Hearing Officer in lieu of the University Disciplinary Committee. In such 
cases, the procedures outlined in Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings will 
be utilized. 

278 
 
 
Composition of the University Disciplinary Committee 
Each case presented to the University Disciplinary Committee is heard by two student 
board members, one staff board member, one faculty board member and one additional 
faculty or staff board member. In addition, a trained moderator will preside over the 
hearing. 
The faculty members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards & 
Integrity  in consultation with Faculty Senate. The staff members will be appointed by the 
Office of the Community Standards & Integrity in consultation with Staff Council. The 
student members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards & Integrity in 
consultation with Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly 
following a selection process coordinated by the Office of Community Standards & 
Integrity. All appointees must complete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible 
to serve as board members. Once trained, board members may complete up to three 
years of service. Board members may be reappointed to successive three year terms. 
Members participating in a given hearing will be selected from a list of eligible individuals 
based upon availability and disinterestedness in the case or parties following review by 
the parties who are appearing before the University Disciplinary Committee. The following 
circumstance would preclude participation as a board member in a given hearing: 
• Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or 
the event(s) leading to the allegations. 
• Individuals with a conflict of interest with the student(s), witnesses or other parties to 
the case.  
• Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case. 
Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings 
The university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all community 
standards reviews. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following 
procedural protections that govern the University Disciplinary Committee process: 
Hearing Preparation and Scheduling 
1. 
The logistics of hearing preparation and scheduling will be coordinated by a process 
advisor in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity. 
2. 
The student must be notified in writing of the specific policy, standard or regulation 
the student has allegedly violated. Such notification is normally made at least seven 
calendar days before the hearing. 

279 
 
 
3. 
Throughout the community standards process, the student respondent will receive 
full notification of complaint, notification of any hearing and notification of 
disposition of the charge and will have the opportunity to be present throughout the 
hearing process. 
4. 
The complainant will receive full notification of the complaint, notification of any 
hearing, and will have the opportunity to be present throughout the hearing process.  
5. 
Prior to the hearing, the individuals involved will be asked if they believe that the 
potential hearing board members are aware of any significant relationship or interaction 
that might impair their ability to render an objective recommendation for resolution of 
the matter under review. The process advisor will consider this in seating the board for 
the hearing. 
6. 
Written introductions are an opportunity for either party to offer their initial thoughts 
and general sentiments about the allegations under review by the University 
Disciplinary Committee.  
7. 
During process advisement, the complainant and respondent will be provided a 
hearing packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the initial 
complainant report; any investigation reports and/or witness statements; a written 
introduction from the complainant(s) to the board; and a written introduction from 
the respondent(s) to the board. This packet may be used for the purpose of 
preparing for or use during the hearing, consistent with the privacy rights of those 
involved. These materials are to be kept private and may be shared only with 
permission from the process advisor. These documents may not be duplicated nor 
utilized for any other purpose. 
8. 
In advance of the hearing, the members of the University Disciplinary Committee will 
be provided a hearing packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the 
initial complainant report; any investigation reports and/or witness statements; a 
written introduction from the complainant(s) to the board; and a written introduction 
from the respondent(s) to the board. Board members are expected to keep the 
information reviewed during a University Disciplinary Committee confidential. 
9. 
Complainant(s) and respondent(s) may submit up to three written letters of support 
at a date specified by the process advisor for consideration only during the outcomes 
phase of the proceeding in the event that the respondent is found responsible. 

280 
 
 
10. It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Standards & Integrity to ensure that 
times set for hearings are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have been 
offered to both the complainant and respondent whenever appropriate. In turn, both 
the complainant and respondent will be expected to demonstrate good faith efforts in 
their participation with this process, particularly in relation to the scheduling of the 
hearing. In a case involving exigent circumstances that prevent the complainant or 
respondent from participating in a scheduled hearing, the hearing will be rescheduled. 
11. Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts with a student's class schedule when 
identifying a hearing date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom 
attendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reasonable excuse for 
delaying a hearing. 
12. In the rare circumstance where a respondent fails to make a good faith effort to 
participate in the process, the university (having made reasonable attempts to 
accommodate the respondent) may elect to schedule and conduct a hearing without 
that student's participation. 
13. Review of incidents involving both community standards allegations and academic 
integrity allegations may be conducted by a University Disciplinary Committee at the 
discretion of the dean of students or designee. 
14. Allegations stemming from multiple incidents indicating an alleged pattern of behavior 
may be collectively reviewed by a single University Disciplinary Committee at the 
discretion of the Resolution Review Board. 
15. The respondent may file in writing counter-allegations against the complainant in 
connection with the incident(s) currently under review by the University Disciplinary 
Committee. In order to be considered for inclusion in the packet in the same hearing 
process, counter-allegations must be raised within a reasonable time (normally two 
business days) of the first University Disciplinary Committee process advisement 
meeting. The counter-allegations must detail the university regulation or policy that the 
respondent believes has been violated in connection with the incident(s) currently under 
review by the University Disciplinary Committee and provide information that 
substantiates the facts and circumstances. Counter-allegations cannot be based solely 
on the fact that a complaint was brought forward, nor can they be retaliatory in nature. 
The Resolution Review Board will determine if the counter-allegations will be reviewed 

281 
 
 
by the University Disciplinary Committee or resolved in a subsequent hearing, based on 
the connection of the counter- allegations to the incident(s) already under review. 
16. Both the complainant and respondent have the right to have one Support Person of 
their choosing present at the hearing. Both parties are required to notify the process 
advisor of their Support Person of choice at a date specified by the process advisor that 
will be at least three days in advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, a 
representative of the University’s Office of General Counsel will typically be present for 
the hearing to provide assistance to the University Disciplinary Committee, moderator, 
and/or process advisor as needed. Legal counsel or any other Support Person, if 
present, will not be permitted to participate in the proceedings but may advise the 
respondent or the complainant and/or be present at a hearing. In the event that one 
party to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance notice, a hearing may 
be postponed until all parties to the case have had an opportunity to have counsel 
present. Registered Support Persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the 
same hearing. 
17. Both the complainant and respondent have the opportunity to register witnesses. 
Witnesses should be able to provide direct information related to the alleged violations 
being reviewed by the University Disciplinary Committee, such as direct observation of 
the incident in question and/or direct interaction with any of the parties before, during 
or after the incident in question. Both parties are required to notify the process advisor 
of their registered witnesses at a date specified by the process advisor that will be at 
least three days in advance of the University Disciplinary Committee hearing. 
18. The university reserves the right to supplement the registered witness list at any time to 
ensure that the board has access to all potential witnesses with substantive information. 
Both the Complainant and Respondent will be promptly notified of any changes to the 
registered witness list. 
19. In scheduling a hearing, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses significant 
to the case being heard are available to the hearing group. If a witness is not available to 
be called by the hearing group in person or via telecommunication, they may submit a 
written statement to the process advisor to be reviewed if the board requests 
information from the witness. 

282 
 
 
Hearing Process and Procedures 
1. 
Information provided during a University Disciplinary Committee hearing should 
remain private. 
2. 
In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted on 
the day of the hearing, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other 
information as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Information offered as 
rebuttal will only be accepted at the discretion of the moderator. 
3. 
All proceedings before a hearing group, except the deliberation of the group, will be 
recorded. Recordings will be kept in accordance with community standards records 
retention practices. 
4. 
During the actual hearing, a student has the right to be present when 
information relative to the case is being presented. In the community standards process, 
a student who is charged with a violation has the right to remain silent. 
5. 
The moderator will remind all persons present at the opening of each community 
standards hearing that the purpose of a University Disciplinary Committee is to 
determine an appropriate response, through a deliberative process, when a violation 
of policy, standard or regulation is alleged. 
6. 
The complainant(s) and respondent(s) will each be limited to ten minutes for their 
introduction.  
7. 
The majority of the proceeding will consist of questioning from the board members for 
all parties as well as the registered witnesses that are called by the board. The 
complainant(s) and respondent(s) will also have the opportunity to present questions for 
the board’s consideration. 
8. 
It is within the discretion of the board to determine whether they wish to hear from 
the registered witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the hearing 
group and subsequently dismissed. They should only be present in the room when 
providing information to the board. Except in documented extenuating 
circumstances, students are expected to make a good faith effort to provide 
information to the University Disciplinary Committee when called as a witness. 
9. 
The complainant(s) and respondent(s) will each be limited to five minutes for their 
summary. 

283 
 
 
10. All materials provided to the complainant(s) and respondent(s) (including those provided 
electronically) must be returned to the process advisor at the conclusion of the hearing. 
Copies of these materials may not be retained or used for any other purpose. 
11. Following the complainant and respondent summary, the board will enter closed 
deliberations. A more likely than not standard (preponderance of the evidence) will 
be used to determine if a university policy, standard or regulation was violated. If 
responsibility is determined, the board will make a recommendation for appropriate 
outcomes. 
12. No information about a respondent's prior community standards record will be shared 
with the University Disciplinary Committee until a determination of responsibility has 
been made unless the case being reviewed stems from the prior incident for which a 
community standards record exists. If a respondent(s) has a prior community standards 
record and is found responsible by the University Disciplinary Committee, the following 
information will be shared with the board: community standards violation(s) for which 
they were found responsible, date of incident(s), brief summary, outcome(s), and status 
of the case(s). The student may be recalled before the board to discuss the prior 
violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary Committee making a 
recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case.  
Hearing Outcome Determination and Notifications 
16. A representative of the Office of Community Standards & Integrity will be responsible 
for notifying the associate vice president of student affairs for community life or 
designee in writing of the recommendation of the hearing group regarding 
responsibility and any outcomes deemed appropriate. 
17. The associate vice president of student affairs for community life or designee makes 
the decision in the case, informed by the recommendation of the University 
Disciplinary Committee. The associate vice president of student affairs for 
community life or designee may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation, or 
may remand the matter to a new University Disciplinary Committee for review. 
18. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs 
for community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter 
will typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor. 
19. In cases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by 
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating 

284 
 
 
violence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA), the complainant/ impacted party will receive notification of 
disposition of the allegation(s).  
20. Parents of a student normally will not be notified of any community standards action. 
21. Community standards actions will be recorded in the student's education record in the 
Office of Community Standards & Integrity in accordance with community standards 
records retention practices. When community standards actions affect eligibility for 
enrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Community standards 
records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the academic record of 
a student. 
Appeals 
A request for appeal of a decision delivered through the University Disciplinary 
Committee process must be submitted in writing to the president of the university by the 
respondent within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision. 
In cases where the disposition of the charge has been communicated to the complainant 
and/or impacted party (as described above), the complainant and/or impacted party may 
also submit a request for appeal in writing to the president of the university within seven 
calendar days of the official notification of the decision. 
The written appeal request should indicate whether the student is appealing the finding(s) 
of responsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The 
basis of an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases: 
• A gross procedural error that materially affected the outcome; 
• The outcome(s) imposed were not commensurate with the violation(s) of community 
standards for which the respondent(s) were found responsible; 
• The finding was not consistent with a preponderance of the evidence; 
• New information, which was unavailable at the time of the hearing, that merits re-
consideration of the final disposition. 
The appeal officer designated by the president will review the written appeal request and 
determine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, sufficient grounds exist for at 
least one basis of appeal to be further explored through review by the appeal officer. In 
hearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their discretion, may meet with individuals and 
review information relevant to the bases of the appeal. In the event of an appeal process, 

285 
 
 
outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the resolution of the appeal, except 
in cases where the university determines there may exist a threat to the safety and 
welfare of the campus community, in which case outcomes will take immediate effect. 
Interim measures put in place via the Safety Intervention Protocol are not outcomes and 
therefore remain in effect per their original terms during the pendency of the appeal. 
Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances 
warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the respondent(s) 
and complainant(s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline. 
The appeal officer has the authority to modify the decision as they deem appropriate for 
resolution of the matter being appealed, which could entail an increase, decrease or 
change to the nature of the outcome(s). The appeal officer may also reconvene the initial 
University Disciplinary Committee or remand the matter to a new University Disciplinary 
Committee for review. 
Cases Involving Prohibited Conduct Under Section VI.E of the Sexual Misconduct 
Policy (Interim) 
Alleged violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) that meet the definition of 
Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct will be resolved in accordance with the Hearing 
Procedures for the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct set forth in Section 
VI.C of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). Cases involving Other Prohibited Conduct 
with student respondents under section VI.E of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) will 
be resolved in accordance with the Community Standards process subject to the following 
additional procedures. 
1. 
In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may 
violate the university Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) and the impacted party 
chooses not to serve as a complainant in a community standards proceeding, the 
university may act as a complainant when there exists a broader or overriding 
community interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to 
serve as complainant, they may nevertheless act as a witness in a University 
Disciplinary Committee hearing. 
2. 
For all Prohibited Conduct, students may utilize alternative resolution options for 
their complaint as set forth in Section VI.G of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). 
3. 
In cases involving alleged violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim), the 
university will register the appropriate university investigator(s) to serve as potential 
witnesses during a University Disciplinary Committee hearing. 

286 
 
 
4. 
Expert witnesses may testify before the University Disciplinary Committee only as 
specified in Appendix B of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). 
5. 
In general, new information will not be added to the investigative report under VI.B of 
the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). The Process Advisor has discretion to allow 
new documentary evidence prior to a hearing or to remand the matter back to the 
investigator for further investigation. 
6. 
In cases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by 
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating 
violence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA), the complainant/impacted party will receive notification of 
disposition of the allegation(s) and has the right to submit an appeal following 
notification of the disposition of a complaint resolved by a University Disciplinary 
Committee. 
7. 
After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs 
for community life or designee will notify the respondent in writing of their decision 
as well as the process for appeal. Notifications to the complainant/impacted party in 
cases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by 
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating 
violence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA) will be made in writing by the process advisor and will include 
notification of the appeal process. 
8. 
Administrative resolution meetings and University Disciplinary Committee hearings 
will be conducted by officials who receive annual training on the issues related to all 
Prohibited Conduct on how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that 
protects the safety of all involved while promoting accountability and a fair process. 
Cases Involving Student Organizations 
Carnegie Mellon University is committed to managing all cases that involve alleged 
violations of university policy by student organizations with appropriate care and 
sensitivity. In these cases, the university may need to invoke additional procedural 
provisions to determine responsibility for alleged policy violation(s) by a student 
organization. Recognized student organizations include groups that are given recognition 
by a college, department or governing body on campus. Recognized student organizations 
have certain privileges and use of campus resources (e.g. funding (university or student 

287 
 
 
fees), use of designated spaces, participation in campus activities, ability to utilize 
university systems, etc).  
In cases of alleged policy violations in which the responding party is a student 
organization, the following procedures will supplement the procedures outlined in the 
Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings: 
1. 
In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may 
violate university policy and the impacted party chooses not to serve as a 
complainant in a community standards proceeding, the university may act as a 
complainant when there exists a broader or overriding community interest. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to serve as complainant, 
they may nevertheless act as a witness in a University Disciplinary Committee 
hearing. 
2. 
In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may 
violate university policy, the university reserves the right to temporarily restrict any 
and all activities and operations of the organization while the case is being 
investigated and/or resolved through the appropriate process. 
3. 
For purposes of organizational conduct, separation from the university may be 
defined as temporary or permanent loss of recognition along with associated 
privileges.  
4. 
No more than two student members may represent an organization in a community 
standards proceeding. 
5. 
The University Disciplinary Committee may review both individual member and 
organizational allegations concurrently. It is recommended that members 
responding to individual allegations do not also represent the organization in the 
same University Disciplinary Committee. 
6. 
A preponderance of the evidence standard (e.g., more likely than not) will be used to 
determine if a university policy, standard, or regulation has been violated. 
7. 
Administrative resolution meetings will be conducted by the SLICE representative or 
designee for alleged violations of community standards by an organization. Should 
administrative resolution fail, the matter will be remanded to the Office of 
Community Standards & Integrity for resolution. 
8. 
The complaining party and each designated student representative is entitled to a 
copy of the board packet before the hearing. 

288 
 
 
9. 
The university is committed to resolving cases related to organizational conduct in a 
timely manner. Complainants and respondents will receive periodic status updates 
related to the timeline for resolution of the case. 
10. The university reserves the right to share periodic updates related to process, 
timeline, findings, and resolution of the case with appropriate parties including 
organization advisors, the sponsoring academic unit, (inter)national organization 
headquarters, and/or recognizing body (e.g. Student Government or appropriate 
Governing Councils), etc. 
11. Unless a different timeline is set forth in this section, stated timelines for a University 
Disciplinary Committee hearing and notification of a decision will be followed in 
cases involving student organizations. 
12. Upon a finding of responsibility, the University Disciplinary Committee or 
adjudicator will be provided with the student organization’s prior community 
standards violations (four years prior) for consideration when determining outcomes. 
The student organization representatives may be recalled before the board to 
discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary 
Committee making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present 
case. The complainant may be recalled with the student organization 
representatives. 
13. The University Disciplinary Committee may recommend as an outcome of the 
organizational review, that an individual or individuals be charged with specific policy 
violations to be reviewed via a subsequent community standards process. 
14. In cases that involve student organizations, complaints will be considered for a 
period of four years following the date of the most recent allegation.  Complaints 
received more than two years following the date of the most recent allegation may 
be reviewed upon the approval of the Associate Vice President for Community 
Standards and Diversity Initiatives. 
15. In cases that involve student organizations, the complainant will receive notification 
of disposition of the allegation(s) to the degree that individual privacy is not 
impacted. 
16. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs 
for community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter 
will typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor. 

289 
 
 
17. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances 
warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the 
respondent and complainant as necessary about the anticipated timeline. The 
complainant and respondent will be notified in writing of the final decision. 
18. Consistent with Pennsylvania state law, the university will issue and electronically 
publish a biannual report of all reported hazing violations. Biannual hazing reports 
are retained for at least five years. 
19. Community standards records of student organizations are retained for a period of 
seven years following the conclusion of the resolution process. The record may 
be maintained indefinitely if a student organization has not fulfilled all outcomes or 
has not resolved pending community standards allegations. Records of community 
standards processes that result in the temporary loss of recognition from the 
university will be maintained for a period of seven years after the organization 
receives recognition once the suspension period has concluded. Records of 
community standards processes that result in the permanent loss of recognition 
from the university will be maintained indefinitely. 
Outcomes 
The community standards outcomes defined below comprise a range of official action that 
may be imposed by the University for violations of community standards. One or more of 
these actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, 
as other outcomes may be utilized as appropriate. 
When outcomes are decided as part of the community standards process, the educational 
and developmental needs of the involved student and the welfare of the community will be 
considered with utmost importance. The outcomes categories (i.e. student status, restorative 
and restrictive) are intended to clarify the role and purpose of the various actions. The 
determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of 
the community, the impact of the violation, documented community standards history, and 
any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.  
Non-compliance with imposed or agreed-upon outcomes may result in further action 
through the community standards process. Students with two (2) community standards 
violations within and academic year may immediately be placed in disciplinary probation. 
Student involved in three (3) violation within an academic year may be referred to the 
University Disciplinary Committee. 

290 
 
 
Outcomes Related to Student Standing 
These outcomes clarify the student’s standing with the University. Additional violations of 
community standards may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the 
University. 
• Warning: For minor infractions, a student may be issued a written warning. The 
warning will be noted in the event of any further infractions of community standards 
and may justify consideration of more severe outcomes. While a warning may 
influence future actions related to student standing, a warning alone does not affect 
student standing.  
• Residential Probation: An official notice to a residential student that conduct with 
regard to university housing regulations or policies has been unacceptable and that 
future violation of university regulations may result in more serious community 
standards action, including the possible loss of campus residency. Probation lasts for a 
stated period of time. 
• Disciplinary Probation: For a second infraction or for a single offense of a more serious 
nature, a student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a designated period of 
time, during which subsequent community standards violations may result in 
suspension or expulsion.  A student on probation is still considered to be in good 
standing with the university. 
• Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated 
period of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves 
from the campus (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or sorority 
houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and 
to remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the 
Policy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on disciplinary 
suspension is not eligible to register for courses, attend classes, live in university 
housing, use campus facilities, be on university property, participate in student 
activities, be an active member of a student organization, or be employed by the 
university during the period of suspension. 
• Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the 
university. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from 
university property (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or 
sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the 

291 
 
 
action and to remain off the campus permanently. Students who have been expelled 
from the university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the 
university. 
Restorative Outcomes 
These outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior 
caused or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the 
community.  Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in 
additional community standards action. 
• Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The University may require a student 
to meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a 
specified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any 
relevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent 
recommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The 
student is expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to 
confirm compliance with this outcome. 
• Community Service: The University may require uncompensated service (a specified 
number of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an 
outcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre- approved through the 
appropriate university adjudicator. Students must provide appropriate documentation 
verifying their completed community service. Failure to complete the service 
satisfactorily within the specified period of time may result in further action through 
the community standards process. 
• Educational/Developmental Assignment: The University may require a student to 
complete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and 
development. These assignments are at the discretion of the university adjudicator or 
University Disciplinary Committee. Assignments may include but are not limited to: 
reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an 
individual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. 
• Restitution: In cases where a student is found responsible for damaging or 
misappropriating physical property, the student may be responsible for reimbursing 
the property owner for all or some of the cost. 
In limited circumstances when a complaint was filed prior to the respondent’s degree 
conferral, the dean of students or designee may consider the following outcomes: 

292 
 
 
• Suspension of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being suspended and 
the transcript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The degree will remain 
suspended until the time specified and any pending outcomes are completed. During the 
duration of the degree suspension, the individual is prohibited from: representing that 
they have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling at Carnegie 
Mellon University; being present on University property; or participating in any Carnegie 
Mellon University sponsored events or activities, including alumni events. 
• Revocation of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being revoked and the 
transcript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The individual is prohibited from: 
representing that they have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling 
at Carnegie Mellon University in the future; being present on University property; or 
participating in any Carnegie Mellon University sponsored events or activities, including 
alumni events.  
Restrictive Outcomes 
These outcomes prevent a student from engaging in certain activities, being present in 
certain spaces or engaging with individuals during a specific time period. Violation of a 
restriction may lead to additional community standards action. 
• Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to 
facilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. 
• Loss of Residency in University Housing: An action that excludes a student or student 
group from residence in university housing for a stated period of time. A student who 
loses residency in university housing shall be considered for future housing 
accommodations once the period of debarment is concluded and as space permits. 
• No Contact Order: A No Contact Order is a directive from an associate vice president of 
student affairs or designee indicating that two students may not have direct contact 
with each other, or make indirect contact through third parties, except for that which is 
necessary for their academic pursuits. A No Contact Order may be issued in 
connection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure 
during the pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of 
responsibility from the process. 
• Room Reassignment: An action where a student is assigned to either another room in 
the same house community or a room in another house community. When a student 
is assigned to another house community, specific restrictions concerning the previous 
community may be invoked.  

293 
 
 
Withholding a Degree 
Because a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic 
requirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a 
member of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a 
degree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the 
resolution of community standards proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. 
Citations 
State citations are issued by University Police for violations of state law. While these 
citations are handled through the criminal justice system, students may also be expected to 
meet with a university adjudicator to determine whether a violation of community standards 
has also occurred. 
Withdrawal with Pending Allegations 
Students who withdraw from the university with unresolved community standards 
allegations should expect the university to adjudicate the matter to bring the case to 
resolution and uphold the university’s obligation to expressly articulate eligibility to return to 
the university. If a good faith effort to participate in the appropriate process is not exhibited 
by the respondent, the university may elect to resolve the matter through the community 
standards process without that student's participation. 
Review After a Charge or Conviction of a Crime 
In circumstances that constitute a potential threat to the safety and security of the university 
community and/or to the university’s ability to function in whole or in part, the university may 
review a case when a student has been charged with or convicted of any felony or 
misdemeanor crime(s) in federal, state, or local court or an equivalent foreign court. The 
review will be conducted utilizing the university's community standards process and/or 
Safety Intervention Protocol. 
Examples of crimes that may trigger such review include but are not limited to: 
• Aggravated assault 
• Arson 
• Burglary 

294 
 
 
• Child abuse 
• Criminal mischief 
• Hazing 
• Murder or manslaughter 
• Rape 
• Robbery 
• Sexual assault 
• Theft 
• The manufacturing, selling or possessing with intent to sell any drug on the prescribed 
list subject to the criminal code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
Community Standards Records Retention and Reporting 
Records of community standards proceedings are confidential and are not released without the 
consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court 
order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of community standards proceedings are 
retained for either the period of time required under the federal Clery Act (which in most cases 
is six to seven years after the date the incident was reported to the university), or three years 
after final separation of the student from the university, whichever is longer. For purposes of 
determining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three 
continuous years. If a student re-enrolls in any student program within three years, the 
calculation of the final separation date will reset. 
Consistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of community standards record 
checks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as 
necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) provided 
the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. 
The file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student 
separates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a 
pending Community Standards violation. 
Records of community standards proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a 
student from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. 

295 
 
 
Case-specific questions regarding timeframes for community standards records retention and 
reporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity.
