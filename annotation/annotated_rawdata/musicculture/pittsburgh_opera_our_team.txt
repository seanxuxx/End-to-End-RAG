Pittsburgh Opera: Auditions | Pittsburgh Opera
Pittsburgh Opera holds auditions for principal roles, chorus, orchestra, supernumeraries, and the Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Training Program on a regular basis.
MADAMA BUTTERFLY CHILD SUPERNUMERARY
Download the full casting call here.
Pittsburgh Opera is seeking a child to play the role of “Trouble” in our production ofMadama Butterfly, to be performed at the Benedum Center in March 2025. This part is a simple but crucial role in the narrative of this wrenching story.
Seeking an Asian, Pacific Islander identifying child, no gender preference (however, please note, they will be costumed as a male/boy-presenting character).  Though the story specifies a boy three years old, we expect to cast a child of five (5) or six (6) years, ideally small in stature.
We are looking to cast two children. Specific performances TBD, but you must be available for all rehearsals and performances. We may choose one child, with a second one as an alternate in case of illness. If auditioning, you must be available for all scheduled calls (rehearsals and performances).
The child appears in the latter half of the opera and is on stage at the very end. As such, some rehearsals and performances will end as late as 11pm.
The tentative schedule is subject to change. We will also have additional times needed for costume fittings; typically, one to two sessions lasting 30-60 minutes.
Auditions will be held onWednesday, February 12 starting at 4:00pmand may involve basic theater games, following basic instructions and working with adult actors. There is no singing or speaking requirement.
Sign up for an audition here!

Pittsburgh Opera’s Supernumeraries are enthusiastic and dependable. Supers are required to attend approximately 10-15 rehearsals, generally nights and weekends, as well as all performances. The occasional daytime rehearsal may be scheduled.
Supers are paid a small honorarium of $100 and receive two (2) complimentary tickets, subject to availability. We are not able to offer housing or union credit for these roles.
