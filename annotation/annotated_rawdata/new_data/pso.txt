She is also grateful to her other teachers — Sarah Young, Robert Sorton, Elaine Douvas, John Mack, H. Robert Reynolds and Max Rudolf. DeAlmeida proudly plays on F. Loree oboes of Paris, France.
In November 2002, DeAlmeida’s first solo CD was released on the Boston Records label. Classic Discoveries for Oboe was hailed by American Record Guide as “a masterly recording… Cynthia Koledo DeAlmeida is simply one of the finest exponents of the instrument anywhere.” Her second solo CD, entitled Mist Over the Lakeon the Crystal Record label, was released in 2006 to rave reviews: “Ms. DeAlmeida is hands down one of the best players in the world…” In 2015, her third CD Silver and Gold was released on the Crystal Records label. Gramophone magazine called her “a poetic artist” and Fanfare magazine wrote “she is a soloist of immense technique and considerable charm…”  DeAlmeida can also be heard on Crystal Records’ recording of Sir Andre Previn’s Sonata for Oboe, Bassoon, and Piano with Sir Andre Previn, as well as all the Pittsburgh Symphony recordings since 1991 under Lorin Maazel, Mariss Jansons, Marek Janowski and Manfred Honeck. In 2009, DeAlmeida travelled to Berlin to perform and record the German Requiem of Brahms with Marek Janowski and the Radio Orchestra of Berlin (RSB) on the Pentatone label.
DeAlmeida has been featured with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in concertos by J.S.Bach, Leonardo Balada, Alan Fletcher, Francaix, Haydn, Mozart, Lucas Richman, Richard Strauss and Vaughan Williams.

DeAlmeida is an avid chamber musician, having performed 10 recitals at Carnegie Mellon University since 1993. For one of these recitals, she commissioned, published and recorded a piece for Oboe, Horn, Cello, and Piano by Michael Moricz, entitled “Three Consequences for Four Players.” Each summer since 2002, she performs and teaches as a faculty member of the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California. Several of her performances there have been featured on NPR’s Performance Today. DeAlmeida has also performed at the Strings Festival in Steamboat Springs, Colorado; the La Jolla Festival in La Jolla, California; and the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont as well as several “Music from Marlboro” tours.

In 2003, DeAlmeida was featured on national television on the CBS Early Show in a story relating to the oboe and its remarkable health benefits for asthma sufferers, which led to her work as an ambassador for the American Respiratory Alliance in Pittsburgh.
DeAlmeida volunteers at Pittsburgh’s classical radio station WQED in their fundraising pledge drives. She participates in the Pittsburgh Symphony’s Education and Community Engagement department playing and speaking to young people in various venues throughout the Pittsburgh area.

Violist Tatjana Mead Chamis has distinguished her career with successes as a principal violist, chamber musician, soloist, Latin Grammy-nominated recording artist, teacher and lecturer, as well as advocating for underheard or suppressed music and experimenting with new music.
Principal Violist of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for the 2018-2024 seasons, Mead Chamis has held the title of Associate Principal Viola of the PSO since 2003.  Mead Chamis joined the orchestra in 1993, under the directorship of Lorin Maazel, while still a student of the Curtis Institute of Music, at age 22.  She has since been featured on numerous performances as soloist with the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Pittsburgh Symphony Chamber Orchestra, often premiering or introducing pieces not yet heard in Pittsburgh, such as the Lionel Tertis transcription of Elgar's Cello Concerto, Boris Pigovat’s Requiem for the Holocaust, and Alan Shulman’s Theme and Variations.  This coming season, she will perform the viola transcription of Fratres, by Arvo Pärt, with the Pittsburgh Symphony.
In 2015, Mead Chamis formed a string quartet of fellow Pittsburgh Symphony members, the Clarion Quartet, an ensemble dedicated to performing the many works of suppressed and forgotten composers. The Clarion Quartet’s debut album, Breaking the Silence , was released in February of 2018 on the TYE/Naxos label. The quartet has played at the site of the Theresienstadt concentration camp in the Czech Republic, at the Berlin American Academy, on tour in Canada, joined the great baritone Matthias Goerne in concert, and appeared on the Chamber Music Pittsburgh Series with pianist Roman Rabinovich.  The quartet began in 2023, a partnership with Pittsburgh’s City of Asylum, featuring a series of concerts over two years, which reach audiences across the globe.
After a year-long sabbatical in 2012, living and performing in Brazil, Mead Chamis returned to the US with Brazilian works for viola, which became the focus of a solo recording project, including a new viola sonata written for her by the great pianist/composer, André Mehmari, which garnered a 2017 Latin Grammy nomination.  The album, Viola Brasil , was released in 2022.  Mead Chamis and Mehmari will perform his sonata as well as other works from this album as invited artists of the 2024 International Viola Congress, in Brazil.
Mead Chamis performs chamber music and solo recitals in the U.S. and internationally, including various appearances at the Caramoor International Music Festival, Vail's Bravo Festival, Halcyon Chamber Music Festival, and Swananoa Chamber Festival.  Apart from her solo performances with the PSO, she has appeared as soloist with the Utah Symphony, Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo Symphony orchestras in Brazil.
American born, Mead Chamis began her musical studies on the violin at age 7 while living in Germany. It was in Salt Lake City, Utah, that she switched to the viola while studying with Mikhail Boguslavsky, co-founder of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra.  She continued her studies at the Curtis Institute of Music with Joseph dePasquale, former principal viola of the Philadelphia Orchestra, graduating in 1994.
Mead Chamis has been a frequent artist/lecturer and teaches orchestral repertoire at Carnegie Mellon University.

Since 2012, James Nova has found a new passion in multitrack recording, also known as "overdubbing." Overdubbing is a process by which a musician records all the parts of a piece of music one by one and layers the recordings on top of each other to create a full ensemble. Nova has released dozens of stunning and virtuosic tracks of his own challenging arrangements of exciting repertoire for trombone choir. The arrangements employ many different trombones: contra bass, bass, tenor, small tenor, alto, and even soprano trombones!
James Nova has had a lifelong love of John Williams’ film scores and in December of 2017, he released a new overdub album for trombone choir, A Fall from Light to Dark. Through the chosen moments of John Williams’ masterful scores, this album musically chronicles the rise and descent of Anakin Skywalker as he transforms into Darth Vader. Truly a one-man show, this album’s transcriptions, playing, recording, editing, mixing and mastering were all done by Nova himself.
James Nova has always been passionate about music education. When not on stage at Heinz Hall with the Pittsburgh Symphony, he can be found at the Mary Pappert School of Music at Duquesne University where he is brass coordinator and adjunct trombone faculty, as well as the brass coach of the Three Rivers Young Peoples Orchestras.

Jennifer Orchard
First Violin
“I can’t remember a time when I was not playing the violin,” says Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra violinist Jennifer Orchard. The statement reflects on her earliest memories of music, but it speaks to a larger truth about this gifted artist: Life and music have always been joined as she lives out her life passion every day.
Orchard’s biography spans all of the rites of passage that come with attaining the status of a world-class musician—the childhood successes the rigors of conservatory training, and the progress of a professional career. Yet the conventional narrative does not capture the more complete picture of Orchard, who has a heartfelt love for the beauty of music and a sense of purpose as she brings it to life.
Orchard came to the violin as a young child and grew rapidly. Her early success led to admission into the Curtis Institute of Music and The Juilliard School, where she honed the skills that would lead to a professional career.
She speaks with reverence of her teachers, including famed violinists Szymon Goldberg, Robert Mann and Lorand Fenyves, who helped her achieve both virtuosity and artistry.
From her conservatory studies, Orchard entered her first professional position as a member of the Lark Quartet. She played with Lark for eight years, from 1993-2001 and while there began a recording career that continues to this day.
Now a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony first violin section, Orchard channels her artistic endeavors through many avenues. In 2015, she and three other PSO musicians formed the Clarion Quartet which commits itself to performance and awareness of composers whose lives and careers were destroyed through the atrocities of WWII. These composers, deemed degenerate by the Nazi party have been neglected and largely forgotten since the war. The Clarion Quartet’s mission is to break the silence and restore this music to its rightful place on the stages of today. Their recording of three such composers came out in 2018 and is available on Naxos.
Orchard’s recording work also includes partnering with pianist Igor Kraevsky on the music of Paul Juon, a Russian composer whose works were also, though not through war, neglected and largely unknown. Orchard and Kraevsky’s work together has spanned fifteen plus years, performing the world premiere of Paul Juon’s Triple concerto in Moscow Conservatory Hall and producing many recordings including two world premieres entitled Weisse Nachte and Bagatellen.
Orchard expresses a sincere and humble gratitude for having had the opportunity in her life to play with great musicians and for appreciative audiences, which is the fulfillment of a life mission.
As for how she articulates that personal mission, she says without hesitation: “To always have passion about the music, and to never stop playing.”

Manfred Honeck
Music Director
Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s
          leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations
          receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the
          Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the
          2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home
          and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural
          ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include
          Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major
          venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg
          Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival,
          Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads
          the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour,
          starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the
          prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus.
Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively
          documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring
          works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss,
          Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding
          reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the
          orchestra won the GRAMMY® for "Best Orchestral Performance" in 2018.
          The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with
          Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical
          acclaim.
Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the
          University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a
          member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna
          State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a
          conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination
          to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his
          conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of
          the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the
          Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize
          in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of
          the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian
          National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic
          Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the
          Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he
          was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra,
          following decades of close collaboration.
Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his
          four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he
          conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss,
          Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses
          such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la
          Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg
          Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new
          staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In
          autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, 
          leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo . Beyond the
          podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites,
          including Janáček’s Jenůfa , Strauss’s Elektra , Dvořák’s Rusalka as
          well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the
          globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Salome , was premiered
          by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023.
As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading
          international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,
          Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig,
          Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw
          Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di
          Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States,
          he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York
          Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los
          Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony
          Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic
          Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty
          years.
In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging
          programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all
          four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will
          return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony,
          Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and
          Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's
          anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on
          the music of this composer.
Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in
          the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by
          the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International
          Classical Music Awards declared him "Artist of the Year".

President & CEO
Randi & L. Van V. Dauler, Jr. President & CEO Chair
Melia Tourangeau began her tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra when she was appointed President & CEO in May of 2015, the first woman and the youngest CEO in the Symphony’s 124-year history. Tourangeau’s personal and professional commitment to creating deep and meaningful connections between music, musicians and the community is a hallmark of her leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, one of America’s most distinguished orchestras.
Soon after her arrival, Tourangeau led the revival of a strategic planning process that has heightened the orchestra’s artistic excellence with innovative concerts, partnerships, premieres, and debuts; moved the organization toward financial stability, including growing the annual fund by 17%; fostered closer cooperation between the board, musicians, staff and volunteers; and deepened the orchestra’s community relationships and reach with new programming and digital technology. She is currently leading a new initiative to promote diversity and inclusion across the organization, with patrons, and with the community. Under Tourangeau’s leadership, the Pittsburgh Symphony has extended the contract of its Music Director, Manfred Honeck, welcomed ten new musicians to the Orchestra and brought new distinguished members of the community to the Board. She successfully led negotiations for a new contract with members of the Orchestra. Tourangeau has represented the orchestra on several highly acclaimed domestic and international tours, enhancing the orchestra’s international reputation. During her tenure, the orchestra’s illustrious recording history has been underscored with numerous GRAMMY Awards and nominations, including the award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2018.
Tourangeau came to the Pittsburgh Symphony from the Utah Symphony | Utah Opera (USUO) in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she served as President & CEO beginning April 2008. Prior to the USUO, Tourangeau worked for the Grand Rapids Symphony in Michigan, beginning as education director in January 1997, being promoted to director of operations in 1999, then vice president and general manager before being named CEO in 2005. Prior to that, she was the education coordinator at the Akron Symphony Orchestra.
She received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1994 from the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music with a major in piano performance and a minor in musicology. In April 2007, she received a master’s degree in public administration with an emphasis on nonprofit leadership from Grand Valley State University.
