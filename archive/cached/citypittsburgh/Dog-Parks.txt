Our Parks, Trails and Off-Leash Exercise Areas remain open during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pickleball, Tennis, Skate Parks, Frisbee Golf, Bocce and Fields, as well as the Bob O'Connor Golf Course have re-opened as we entered phase yellow. Organized sports are not permitted and large group gatherings are not allowed. Please adhere to social distancing guidelines while visiting, by staying 6 feet apart.
Citiparks cooperates with other city and county departments to provide many facilities and special interest areas to our residents. Please enjoy all of the parks that Pittsburgh and the surrounding region has to offer year round.
