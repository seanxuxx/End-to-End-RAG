Founded in part to remove sole financial burden from the City of Pittsburgh for regional attractions, in RAD's nearly 28 years of public support, the five regional parks have received over $150 million in operating and capital grants. RAD is proud to play such a significant role in ensuring that our regional parks are safe and vibrant places for our communities to gather, explore, and be inspired.
