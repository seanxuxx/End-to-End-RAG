Schenley Plaza comes aglow with different light-up sculptures and interactive artworks that fill this space with holiday cheer each year in the heart of Oakland . I took some of my favorite wintry photos at GLOWLAND in previous years, plus you're just a minute walk away from the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Chapel, both of which make stunning backdrops for photos when it snows!

Tunnels of illuminated stars. Moroccan lanterns hung from trees. Ponds filled with beacons of light. 2,000+ illuminated flowers. Pittsburgh Botanic Garden is a can't-miss for fantastic holiday photos with so many ideas for backgrounds, macro photos and beautiful bokeh guarantee you're going home with great content.
Shooting outdoors and in low light can be tricky, but a great way to get stellar indoor Christmas shots is to head to holiday pop-up bars throughout the city. Barcadia has a selfie station set up right in front of their Home Alone-inspired theme, the rooftop of Il Tetto is sparking with holiday lights, and Christmas ephemera fills Miracle on 6th. Turn on portrait mode and get those perfect shots.
Skip the photo in front of your tree this year and head to ours instead! Carnegie Museum of Art fills their Hall of Architecture with towering fir trees trimmed to perfection each year, each of which is perfect for a family photo op! And be sure to pause for a photo with Dippy the Dino right outside the Carnegie Museum of Natural History who is decked out in his wintry best.

One of the best parts of Pittsburgh is that you have 90 unique neighborhoods to choose from if you prefer to just grab some authentic shots from the sidewalks. The Mexican War Streets area of the NorthSide always has great decorations from the residents, the shops in Lawrenceville and Shadyside make the walk through them a winter wonderland or catch the buzz of holiday shopping with our vibrant Strip District of local merchants, fish markets and international grocers.
