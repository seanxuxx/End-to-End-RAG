TITLE: Crosby Adds Another Title to Legendary International Resume | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Ahead of the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game between the U.S. and Canada, Evgeni Malkin went into detail about why Mike Sullivan – behind the bench for Team USA – is such a good coach.
“Because he loves hockey,” Malkin said. “We know he cares about the team. He cares about every player. Six or 7 AM every day, he’s in the office. He’s watching video, he’s talking to other coaches. He’s trying to control everything. He loves hockey so much. He deserves everything. He wins two Cups. Maybe he wins and represents his country.”
But when deciding whether his coach or captain would emerge victorious, Malkin had to go with longtime teammate, best friend and brother, Sidney Crosby:
“I know Sid and Sully, it’s hard choice. But I think Canada will win.”
Malkin was right, as Canada defeated the United States in overtime, 3-2, at Boston’s TD Garden on Thursday. Connor McDavid scored the winner 8:18 in to cap off a tournament that’s had a tremendous impact on the sport of hockey.
“Every opportunity you get to wear the Canadian jersey and compete in this event, it’s something new, but I think you saw the hockey that was on display. It was pretty incredible,” Crosby said. “Just happy for this group. We came together in a short period of time, and found a way to get it done.”

Crosby, the oldest player in the tournament at 37 years old, finished tied for second in points among all players – picking up one goal and four assists in four games.
His passion for the game still burns strong as ever, “and getting an opportunity to play with these guys – how can you not be motivated by that?” Crosby said. “It’s a pretty special group, and happy for Connor to get that goal. He’s an incredible player, and stepped up big when we needed him.”
As did Crosby, who can now add 4 Nations Face-Off Champion to his Team Canada resume ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. The Golden Goal scorer in the 2010 Games, Crosby followed that up by wining gold in Sochi in 2014. He has also won gold medals in the World Cup of Hockey (2016), World Championship (2015) and World Junior Championship (2005). Crosby simply has not lost big games on the international stage, going 48-6 in his career wearing the maple leaf.

Penguins assistant general manager Jason Spezza was teammates with Crosby at that World Championship, and remembers how everyone wanted to be at their best, because they didn’t want to let him down, knowing he’d be at his best.
“I think it's a special quality that he has that not many people I've been around have,” said Spezza, who played 19 NHL seasons. “So, am I surprised? No, but in a way, yes, because he just always finds a way to surprise you and score in the big times and have the big moments.
“I'm sure he's really enjoying this. It's a bunch of younger guys that he hasn't played with, with just the nature of best on best for a long time. So, I'm sure they're all soaking it in, and he just wants to be one of the guys. But when you're around Sid in these tournaments, or even just day to day, as you guys see, he's a special person and extra special player.”
That's something Kyle Dubas has learned since taking over as Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM, and he got to witness in a new environment over the last couple of weeks, serving as Team Canada's director of player personnel at 4 Nations.
And no one knows that better than Sullivan, who greatly respects Crosby, what he’s accomplished in the game and what he represents for the sport. That didn’t diminish despite being on the opposite bench.
Sullivan led Team USA to a win in the first matchup with Canada during round-robin play, and the Americans outplayed their rival for much of the night tonight. While the result was disappointing, Sullivan understands the bigger picture when it comes to the excitement that’s been generated around the game of hockey in the U.S., North America, and even the world.
“These best-on-best tournaments, I think, bring out the best of the best,” Sullivan said. “And the commitment, the investment that all these teams have displayed every night, in my mind, has been an unbelievable celebration of hockey. From a hockey purist or a hockey fan in general, it's hard not to get excited about what we're witnessing.”

TITLE: Dewar, Timmins Embracing "Great Opportunity" in Pittsburgh | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
During Friday’s practice with the Maple Leafs in Denver, Connor Dewar got high-sticked and left early for treatment.
As he was getting “glued up” by the staff, teammate Conor Timmins came into the locker room, right around when the trade deadline hit at 3 PM Eastern time.
“We were on the speakerphone with our GM, and (found out) we were traded,” Dewar said.
Toronto had just played in Vegas on Wednesday, which is when the Penguins first arrived before playing the Golden Knights yesterday evening. So, the two of them hoofed it back to Sin City, meeting their new team last night and practicing there this morning.
Before the session, officially got underway, Dewar and Timmins spent a decent amount of time side-by-side taking in their new surroundings.
“Obviously, I'm great friends with Dew and we played together last year in Toronto and this year. So, to have him here and just have a familiar face in the room, it's really nice,” Timmins said.

Timmins speaks to the media.
Timmins has another familiar face in Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas, dating back to their time together with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League.
Dubas drafted Timmins there back in 2014, when he was the junior club’s GM. Timmins went on to get drafted by the Avalanche in the second round (32 nd overall) of the 2017 NHL Draft before representing Canada at the 2018 World Junior Championship.
The 26-year-old defenseman is now in his sixth NHL season from 2019-25, split between Colorado, Arizona, Toronto and now Pittsburgh.
“He’s a good size (6-foot-3, 213 pounds), incredibly intelligent defenseman. Excellent puck mover,” Dubas said. “We traded for him my last year in Toronto. He’s continued to assert himself there. We think at his age and his capability to move the puck and defend, we still think there’s a lot of potential there.”
Timmins feels like he took some decent strides with his game this year, playing a lot of minutes – averaging 16:19 a night for a contending Maple Leafs team. He has a great relationship with Dubas, which should help him continue along that path.
“I think he values my game, and that's exciting for me as a player, to have someone believe in you like that,” Timmins said. “I'm just excited to prove him right out there.”
Meanwhile, Dewar has played parts of four NHL seasons with Toronto and the Minnesota Wild from 2021-25, recording 19 goals, 27 assists and 46 points in 221 career NHL games. He has also spent parts of four seasons in the AHL with the Iowa Wild and Toronto Marlies, recording 61 points (27G-34A) in 104 career AHL games.
Dubas’ conversations with Head Coach Mike Sullivan about Dewar center around the forward’s energy and competitiveness. He reminds Dubas of Boko Imama in that sense, though they’re different types of players.

Dewar speaks to the media.
“He can come in and bring a certain life and spirit to the group,” Dubas said. “As we continue to work our way through this, it’s important to have those types of people here. Connor’s much younger. He’s under team control with his status. We’ll give him a good run. We’re excited about him.”
Dubas called the next few weeks a great opportunity for the new additions to assert themselves and get into a good spot for next season, with both players looking forward to the opportunity – and to play alongside the likes of Sidney Crosby, of course.
“Yeah, of course that’s the first thing that comes to mind. I think my phone probably blew up more about that than anything about myself. So, it’s exciting,” Dewar said with a grin. “It’s a franchise that’s been successful and has a track record of developing players. So, it’s a great opportunity."

TITLE: Emotional Nedeljkovic Inspires Penguins to Rally Past Flyers | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
After the Penguins went down 3-0 early in the second period of their matchup with the Flyers on Thursday at PPG Paints Arena, Mike Sullivan felt like pulling Alex Nedeljkovic could help change the momentum.
Once the goaltender realized what was happening, the raw emotion spilled over. He broke his stick over the crossbar and slammed the door on the bench while voicing his displeasure. But as Sullivan always says, the thing they love about Nedeljkovic is that he’s a fierce competitor who battles his heart out every single night.
“So, I have no problem with Ned's reaction,” Sullivan said. “For me, that's just an indication of how invested he is. He cares. He's competitive. He wants to win. That's raw emotion, and I have no problem with that. Quite honestly, I thought he inspired the group to want to compete for him. I thought our team responded. I thought Ned was a big part of it.”
The Penguins ended up winning in overtime, 5-4. Evgeni Malkin scored in extra time as part of a four-point night (2G-2A) for the 38-year-old forward, the 31st of his career.
“Ned’s reaction, we understand. We're not happy, too,” Malkin said before quipping in typical Geno fashion, “I'm glad I did not break my stick because I scored two goals after. But I'm mad too, because we understand we (don't give) help to him, for sure.
“I'm glad we (came) back. I mean, this is team. We fight, and score a couple goals, and we believe we can change momentum and win the game. Yeah, lots of emotion for me. I hope it gives me confidence, give confidence to the team.”

Malkin speaks to the media.
The Flyers carried play for much of the first period, building an 8-0 edge in shots, with Nedeljkovic making some key saves to keep the Penguins in it. They started tilting the ice after getting the game’s first power play. Kevin Hayes was denied on a Grade-A scoring chance; Sidney Crosby followed that up with another one at full strength; and the Penguins ended up outshooting Philly 6-0 to end the frame.
The Flyers took a 2-0 lead early in the second, a second deflection goal, before star rookie Matvei Michkov made it 3-0 and ended Nedeljkovic’s night. “The decision to pull Ned wasn't so much performance based as it was to try to change some momentum in the game,” Sullivan said. “You get a certain feeling behind the bench. That was a feeling I had. I thought we responded immediately after that. I think Ned had a lot to do with it, I really believe that. He's a very popular teammate, and nobody wants to be in that situation.”
After Joel Blomqvist entered the game in relief, the Penguins scored twice in a 1:20 span – starting when Phil Tomasino got Pittsburgh on the board with his second goal in as many games. The 23-year-old forward has been playing some good hockey coming out of the break and this month overall, with six points in his last eight games.
“Obviously, I think there’s still some aspects that I want to improve on but overall, I feel pretty good,” Tomasino said. “I’ve been getting some good looks and capitalizing on that.
Erik Karlsson followed that up with his first of the night on a shot from the point to get Pittsburgh within one.
“Ned kind of gave us a little bit of a wake-up call. It was needed,” Tomasino said. “I thought we left him out to dry a little bit. Blommer did a heck of a job coming in there. Once we started going, we played really well. Obviously, wanted to get that one back for Ned, for sure.”

Tomasino speaks to the media.
Boko Imama, who seems tailor-made for this type of rivalry game with his physical style of play, was initially assessed a five-minute major for a hit on Garnet Hathaway in the neutral zone. But after review, it was changed to a two-minute minor for interference. The Flyers did convert, with Michkov getting his second of the night to move him in front of 2024 first overall pick Macklin Celebrini for first place amongst first-year players with 19.
“Boko was just trying to create a little energy out there,” Ryan Graves said. “The guy plays with heart and soul. I’ve played against Boko for a long time. He plays the game hard. He plays the game the right way. He wants to compete. He plays for everybody else in the room. So when he’s out there, guys notice for sure.”
But to steal one of Sullivan’s favorite phrases, it’s a game of momentum – and the Penguins swung it back onto their side after going back to full strength, starting with a chance from Imama out of the box. They kept pushing and got rewarded with another goal from Karlsson, who won his third Norris Trophy as the NHL’s best defenseman in 2023 after scoring 101 points.
“Karl's an elite offensive player. He can really shoot the puck,” Sullivan said. “He did a great job with his decision making (on the offensive blue line), first and foremost, and then his execution.”

Sullivan speaks to the media.
Coming out of the second intermission, Malkin broke through for a big goal. He’s been so good coming out of the break after missing six games due to injury going in. After scoring the overtime winner, Malkin now has seven points in the three games Pittsburgh has played since returning to action.
“In my experience of coaching Geno for the last 10 years, he might be one in particular that can ride momentum. When he scores, when he produces offense, he becomes a confident guy,” Sullivan said. “Geno puts a lot of pressure on himself to produce, and when he doesn't, nobody feels it more than G. He's another guy that cares an awful lot about what's going on with the Penguins, and he wants to do his part to try to help us win. A night like tonight, he was a big part of the offense.”
Sullivan was complementary of Blomqvist’s play as well, saying it was a big step forward for the rookie goaltender. Both netminders will likely see action this weekend, with a back-to-back set on the weekend, and their teammates know they need to tighten up in front of them.
“We need to play right, because if we give them 2-on-1’s, 3-on-1’s, breakaways, not one goalie saves every shot,” Malkin said. “We need to block shots a little bit more. We need (to be) better in D-zone. Just help each one, Ned too. He’s trying to play hard, too. We need to help each goalie. Not a perfect night for everybody, but we take two points and just keep going. We play back-to-back against Boston, Toronto, it’s good teams. It's good challenge for us. Just play hard.”

TITLE: Fleury Plays Pittsburgh for the Final Time | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
After an emotional farewell game in Pittsburgh back in October, Marc-Andre Fleury played against the Penguins for the final time on Sunday in Minnesota.
In that first matchup, the beloved, fan-favorite netminder - who was drafted by Pittsburgh first overall in 2003 and won three Stanley Cups during his 14 years with the franchise - made 29 saves in a 5-3 Wild victory. Today, however, his oldest friends secured final bragging rights - with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin both scoring in a 3-1 win.
“I was waiting for Tanger (Kris Letang) to score!” Bryan Rust joked afterward. “But yeah, it’s cool. Sid and I were actually joking about it before the game. I was like, wouldn’t that be nice if you got the game-winner tonight? And here we are [laughs].”
Meanwhile, Fleury’s line of thinking had been, there's no way these guys will score on me!
"Oh my God. Anyone but these two,” Fleury said afterward. “I feel like I'm going to hear about this for a long time. Sid is still talking about his goal in junior against me.”
As he was making those remarks in the home dressing room, Crosby confirmed them from the visitors dressing room.
“To get one there in the last game against him, I will remind him of that many times,” the captain said with a grin.

Crosby speaks to the media
As always, Crosby and Malkin found a way to craft a great script. It felt so fitting that those two were the only players to find the back of the net against one of their all-time favorite teammates, considering how much they loved competing against each other in practices.
“He's probably saved a lot more than I've scored against him, but definitely a fun competition there,” Crosby said. “Having to go against him every day in practice, enjoyed that. That definitely made me better, and having him as a teammate did, too.”
Fleury called that his favorite part of their time together.
“Obviously, playing together, winning together, those are such good memories and a lot of fun and all the best,” Fleury said. “But to be with these guys every day, and the group of guys that we had all these years is awesome, you know? So, to battle with them and have some laughs in practice and yell at them when I stop them... though tonight, I couldn’t laugh at them.”
Crosby admitted that his goal was lucky, as it went off Wild defenseman Brock Faber before crossing the goal line. Malkin’s came on the power play before Crosby iced the win with an empty-netter. After the game, they caught up with Fleury in the hallway outside of the locker room.
“Sometimes, you make good friends, you see guys every day for 14 years with these guys, and I don't see them much anymore, right?” Fleury said. “So, it's hard. It's hard when that happens, right? But I still always keep such good memories, and when we see each other, it feels like no time’s passed, right? It's like, back to our time there together.”

Fleury speaks to the media
While Crosby said the most important thing was to compete and have fun with this day, he did do some reflecting coming into the contest. For him, what came to mind is how fast time goes.
“You feel like yesterday, you're coming into the league,” Crosby said. “I was so happy to be joining a young group of guys, including Flower, that had high expectations. We were all kind of growing up together in the league. So, I think you reflect on that. Just all the great moments that he was a part of, and just all the little things, not even hockey sometimes. Whether it's the road trips or the off-ice, that stuff, that’s the kind of stuff that sticks with you.”
Another fitting part of today was Fleury moving into second place for all-time starts among goaltenders in NHL history (1,015), against the team he spent more than half of them with.
“To play as long as he has at such a high level, you have to truly love what you do, and he does,” Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. “You can see it every day with how he goes about his business, how he carries himself. He loves being on the ice. He loves competing with his teammates, and I think that's why he's beloved, because of his joy and love for the game, and the position that he plays. That’s why he's been able to endure.
“I mean, he's a talented guy and all of that, and a fierce competitor, but there's a lot of talented guys. His passion for the game, I think, is what has allowed him to endure the career that he has for as long as he has.”
The plan is for Fleury to play the rest of this season, and then officially hang them up. With the Wild in the playoff mix and looking to make a run, Fleury couldn’t let himself get too caught up in the significance of this game. At least, not right now.
“Honestly, I tried to not make it too emotional... I just tried to stay in the moment, play the game,” Fleury said. “I think it's something I will think about and look back in the years to come.”

Lineup Notes
The break did Evgeni Malkin a lot of good, as he is good to go for this matchup after missing six straight contests with a lower-body injury going into the time off.
Bryan Rust, who was out for the last game before the break with a lower-body injury, said, "I think everything's going in the right way. I feel good out there."
Mike Sullivan said that Sidney Crosby, who was sidelined for the last two games before the break with an upper-body injury before playing in the 4 Nations Face-Off, will probably be a game-time decision. But they talked briefly on the plane ride back to Pittsburgh about the captain's status, and Sullivan said Crosby is feeling good.
Game Notes
4 NATIONS, FACING OFF
Sidney Crosby captained Canada to the 4 Nations Face-Off championship over Head Coach Mike Sullivan’s Team USA. Crosby recorded five points (1G-4A) in four games, including three assists in the opening game when he was named Player of the Game. His five points were the second most in the entire tournament.
Crosby joined Wayne Gretzky as the second player to captain two championship teams in NHL International Tournament play.
Penguins Rickard Rakell and Erik Karlsson represented Team Sweden and went 1-0-2-0 in three games, just barely missing out on the Championship Game as they tied Team Canada with five points apiece.
Karlsson recorded a goal and two assists in three games, while Rakell was a plus-1 in two outings. Karlsson’s three points led all Swedish players throughout the tournament.
SID VS. OVI
The 2024-25 season marks the 20th season that generational talents Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin face off. The two have taken part in 71 head-to-head matchups, where Crosby and the Penguins have gone 41-26-4 against Ovechkin and the Capitals. Crosby has 31 goals, 61 assists and 92 points, while Ovechkin has 37 goals, 30 assists and 67 points.
Not only is the Crosby/Ovechkin rivalry one of the NHL’s best, but it’s also the league’s longest-standing rivalry. Crosby and Ovechkin are the only two players in the NHL to play for the same team since the beginning of the 2005-06 season and are two of just five players that are still active that also played in 2005-06 (also Corey Perry, Brent Burns and Ryan Suter).
The 2024-25 season marks the 20th consecutive season that Crosby and Ovechkin have played one another. Only four forward-duos have played against each other in more consecutive campaigns: Ron Francis and Mark Messier (23 seasons), Alex Delvecchio and Doug Mohns (21 seasons), Dean Prentice and Ron Stewart (21 seasons) and Delvecchio and Stewart (21 seasons).
The two have combined to win four Stanley Cups, five Hart trophies (regular-season MVP) three Art Ross trophies (most points), 11 Rocket Richard trophies (most goals), three Conn Smythe awards (playoff MVP) and six Ted Lindsay awards (most outstanding player) among other awards
CLUB 17
Sidney Crosby is leading the charge for the Penguins with 58 points (17G-41A) on the season. The forward is just two points away from becoming the ninth player in NHL history to have 17 or more 60-point seasons, and only Washington’s Alex Ovechkin (17) has more 60-point seasons than Crosby among active players.
He is heating up with four goals in his last five games. With his next tally, he will tie Bobby Hull (610) for 18th place on the all-time goals list. The forward also has assists in three-straight games (3A) that he’s dressed in, and his 1,045 total career assists are four shy of tying Gordie Howe for 10th place on the all-time assists list.
PENS CLAIM KOLYACHONOK
On February 9, the Penguins claimed defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok (koh-lee-ah-CHOHN-ahk) off of waivers from the Utah Hockey Club. The 23-year-old defensemen is signed through the 2025-26 season and has posted five points (2G-3A) in 23 games this season. The native of Minsk, Belarus was originally a second-round pick (52nd overall) of the Florida Panthers in 2019 and has spent the past four seasons between the NHL and AHL.
In 62 career NHL games, he’s recorded 12 points (4G-8A) and one game-winning goal. Kolyachonok also has 150 games at the AHL level split between Tucson and Syracuse, where he’s picked up 48 points (13G-35A) and is plus-12.
CLIMBIN' AND STREAKIN'
Erik Karlsson is currently on a five-game point streak, registering six points (2G-4A) during this span. His point streak is currently tied for third in the NHL among defensemen behind Vancouver’s Quinn Hughes (8) and Washington’s John Carlson (6).
Karlsson leads all Pittsburgh defensemen and ranks fourth on the team with 38 points (6G-32A). The blueliner sits just two points away from surpassing Tomas Sandstrom for 10th place on the all-time points list among Swedish-born players.
Only Nicklas Lidstrom (1,142) has more points all-time among Swedish-born defensemen.
D-MEN SHINING FOR NEW CLUB
Matt Grzelcyk continues to show his offensive capabilities since joining the Pittsburgh Penguins as his 28 points (1G-27A) ranks sixth in the league among defensemen who have joined a new club since the start of this 2024-25 season.
500 CLUB
Rickard Rakell has been having a career year with the Penguins, leading the team in goals (25) and ranks second in points (48). Rakell enters tonight’s game just three points away from reaching 500 career NHL points. The forward is looking to become the 12th player from his 2011 draft class to reach 500 points and the third Swede to do it.
He is two points away from the fourth 50-point season of his career.
QUICK HITS
Pittsburgh’s goaltenders have been consistent as of late, holding their opponents to three goals or fewer in each of the last six outings. In Pittsburgh’s nine games since January 20, the Penguins have allowed only 21 goals against, which is the third fewest in the league in that span.
Michael Bunting has six goals and seven points (6G-1A) in 10 career games against Washington. He has goals in two out of the last three games against them.
Pittsburgh’s penalty kill ranks first in the NHL during the month of February (6-for-6).
Kris Letang (7G-27A-34PTS) and Erik Karlsson (5G-26A-31PTS) rank first and second in points among active defensemen versus Washington, respectively.
Sidney Crosby has consistently produced points throughout his career against the Capitals. Despite not playing in the same division as Washington until 2013-14, Crosby ranks first in points versus the Capitals among all active players, and is currently seventh all-time. Crosby has recorded 31 multi-point efforts against the Capitals, which is quickly approaching the NHL record.
In 152 career day games, Sidney Crosby has tallied 80 goals, 120 assists and 200 points. His 200 points are the second most in NHL history while his 80 goals are the fifth most.
Meet the Penguins
As part of the Penguins Pledge, and in partnership with the National Aviary, Aviary experts and some of their live penguin ambassadors will visit PPG Paints Arena for tonight's game. A permanent display on the FedEx Level of PPG Paints Arena will be home to the visiting penguins and also feature footage of the National Aviary’s Penguin Point habitat for the games when the birds aren't at the arena.

TITLE: How the Penguins Unwound During the 4 Nations Break | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Most of the Penguins were able to get away for some rest and relaxation during the 4 Nations break before returning to practice earlier this week.
“It was a nice little reset... now, we get back into it and ramp it up, and just looking forward to a good push here coming out of the break.” Alex Nedeljkovic said.
We caught up with some of the guys over these last few days about what they were up to...
Evgeni Malkin went to Miami, where his family has a residence: “Good weather, I swim. I'm surprised, I never swim in February. But it's good for your body... See my friends, who I spend time with. Work out with my coach too. It's a fun time. I watched the national teams play. Great games. Go to dinner. (Alex Ovechkin and I) had dinner in Miami together. I see him, we talk a little bit. He just relaxed. I tried to ask him about goals. But he doesn’t want to talk too much. He wants to just enjoy it. He wants to just relax.”
Noel Acciari and Alex Nedeljkovic also went to Florida with former teammate Marcus Pettersson, and met up with Drew O’Connor. As Cookie put it: “ OC came out for dinner one night. He said he was going to be in Fort Lauderdale, and we were like, the three of us are at the resort. Come by, hang out at the pool. We had a great time. Pool from 10 to 4 every day with the kids. Great weather. Eat a little dinner. Weather was 82 and sunny every day.”
Michael Bunting and Kevin Hayes went to the Dominican Republic: “ We planned it about a month ago. It was good. Nice sunshine, a lot of beach. We didn’t touch the pool. We had a boat day, beach, and golf. That was good.”
P.O Joseph took a tropical visit into uncharted territory: “I got my first sunburn. I’m peeling all over. I was in Aruba. I’ve never been there before. We try to go to different places. Tulum, the first year, Dominican Republic last year, Aruba this year. Me, my brother (Mathieu), and three other buddies from home. Get out a little bit from the snow.”
Joseph’s fellow Quebec native Vincent Desharnais went back to the snow for a reset in Montreal: “Honestly, just to have a little bit of comfort. The last five months... playoffs last year ended late, Game 7, free agency... then after that, new team, new everything... things are not going the way you want to, so you get mentally and emotionally drained. Then get traded. Just, it’s a lot to deal with. So, I just went home, had some home-cooked meals and sat by the fireplace and watched movies. Just some normalcy. It was so nice and cozy. The only thing that was not great was the two snowstorms. Those were not great.”
Bryan Rust went home to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario with his wife and two sons: “It was not warm or sunny, but it was fun. Kids played in the snow. Father-in-law had the outdoor rink going, so it was fun.”
Cody Glass obtained a legendary tan in Mexico: “Caught some rays. That was pretty much it. This is the most tan I’ve ever been. We were in Tulum, it was really nice. Good restaurants.”
Ryan Graves went home to Nova Scotia and enjoyed the tranquility: “Winter things, skating, outdoor rink once. A lot of walks, you can walk on the beach, you can walk in the snow. It's nice. There's no one out there, we live in a cottage area. In the winter there's like, no one around.”
Anthony Beauvillier took on some roller coasters: “I went to Cocoa Beach, chilled, went to Disney for a day, Universal for a day. I’m a big Harry Potter fan. Other than that, it was pretty quiet.”

TITLE: Penguins Can’t Overcome Early Deficit against Boston | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Alex Nedeljkovic was named the game’s Second Star in Saturday’s 3-2 loss to Boston at PPG Paints Arena, battling hard to keep his team within striking distance after they gave up an early two-goal lead.
“Ned was huge. I don't think we came out with the game or the energy that we would have liked, and they jumped out to a lead,” Bryan Rust said. “I think after that lead, he was incredible. He made every save.”
Mike Sullivan went back to Nedeljkovic after pulling him on Thursday against Philadelphia, a decision that was more momentum-based than performance-based, which elicited some raw emotion from the netminder . Nedeljkovic regrouped well after both that night and the early deficit, coming up with key saves throughout the game.
“I thought Ned responded really well,” Matt Grzelcyk said. “He keeps us in it... That’s the type of competitor he is. That’s why we love playing in front of him. Especially after what happened last game, to see him respond that way, it’s inspiring for the group. We’ve just got to find a way to come to the rink with a better mindset and more energy and not let it get to that point.”
David Pastrnak – who scored 61 goals in the 2022-23 campaign – extended his point streak to 17 games on a breakaway goal just 1:32 into the game. He now has 15 goals and 32 points over that span.
“I mean, we give up a breakaway to one of the best goal scorers of the last couple of years. There’s nothing Ned can do on that,” said Grzelcyk, who played with Pastrnak for a number of years in Boston. “You never want to go down 1-0 that early. Tonight, we just made it way too easy. And nothing that Ned could do there. So that’s on us.”
That was followed by the Bruins converting their first power play of the game as part of a difficult start for the Penguins, who had been looking to carry the momentum over from a comeback victory against the Flyers.
The Penguins had their fair share of power-play time in the first period, including just over a minute on the two-man advantage. They generated some chances, but couldn’t get one to cross the line.
“I just thought we were a little slow. I don't think we were making the right reads,” Rust said on the power play. “I think we were a little bit on different pages there.”
Nedeljkovic was particularly strong in the second period, doing his part to keep the Bruins from finding another goal. He continued that in the third period, stopping Pastrnak on a penalty shot.
Anthony Beauvillier then scored shorthanded to cut the deficit to 2-1 before Rickard Rakell got high sticked with under two minutes remaining. The Penguins pulled Nedeljkovic to go 6-on-4, but the Bruins got an empty netter. Rakell did tally on the power play, with the Penguins going 1-for-7 on the day, with the top-10-ranked unit unable to find a timely goal or two.
“I think we’re just kind of hesitating a little bit and holding onto pucks,” Grzelcyk said. “I think we got into a good groove there for a while, just because we were moving pucks quick, no matter if it was obvious the guy was open. It kind of throws the PK off. It seems like we’re kind of dragging it a little bit and it’s easy for the penalty kill to set up in the structure that they want. So we’ve got to move pucks quick and also attack more down low. I think we’re playing in the high ice a little bit too much.”
The Penguins will look to bounce back Sunday against the Toronto Maple Leafs at 1 p.m. to cap off their three-game homestand.

TITLE: Penguins Fight Hard, Fall Short Against Rangers | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
After a tough loss to Washington on Saturday, the Penguins’ first game out of the 4 Nations Face-Off break, they responded with a much better effort on Sunday versus New York. But they still ended up on the wrong side of the score, as the Rangers earned a 5-3 win.
“I thought our team played extremely hard. I thought we carried play the majority of the night,” Head Coach Mike Sullivan said. “Give the Rangers credit. They were opportunistic on some of the chances that they got. I just think we got to continue to dig in.
“I said to them after the game, ‘If we put that game on the ice on most nights, we're going to win some games,’ and I believe that. I thought we carried territory, zone time, chances, opportunities. You can't always control whether the puck is in the net or not. What you can control is a process to give yourself opportunities to create chances, and I thought our group did that. Our intentions were in the right place.”
The first period was relatively even, with Evgeni Malkin opening the scoring before New York tied it up. He had missed the last six games going into the time off, and has been flying after nearly a month with no game action. The play was started by Danton Heinen, moved onto Malkin’s left wing in place of Michael Bunting, who slotted next to Kevin Hayes.
In the second period, the Penguins did everything but score. They recorded the first 17 (!) shots and ended up with a 19-4 edge, but Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Igor Shesterkin held down the fort. At the other end, New York was opportunistic. Rangers forward and local product J.T. Miller, recently acquired by Vancouver, scored with exactly three minutes left in the frame to put his team up 2-1.
Coming out of the intermission, Ryan Shea stepped up – scoring twice, his first two tallies of the season, for the first multi-goal game of his career. His only other goal came last season, on April 4 against Washington.
“The first one (started with) just the patience of (Erik Karlsson),” Shea said. “Geno just tossed it back to me, kid got in my shot lane and lucky enough, I got it up in time. I don't think he saw it at all, but definitely felt good to get that one.
“The second one was, I didn't see it until about two minutes later. So, that one, I had pressure coming in my face. I tried to just whack it back down, and I guess it hit the D man's pants and went in. That's a good bounce that I'm not familiar with, so it was definitely a good feeling there.”
The Penguins defenseman, who’s spent much of the season as the extra in that group, slotted in for Vincent Desharnais (who came from the Canucks with Heinen in exchange for Marcus Pettersson and Drew O’Connor). It marked Shea’s third appearance since the calendar turned.
“It’s unreal,” Hayes said. “Sheazo’s a great player, he’s a great teammate. He obviously wants to be in the lineup every single night. But he hasn’t been, and he hasn’t really been pouty. He’s been working hard, he stays on the ice after practice. He goes on early, he works on his game. He got called on tonight and I think he played his best game of the year.”
Pittsburgh played with five blueliners for 40-plus minutes, as Matt Grzelcyk went to the locker room in the first period after a hit from Matt Rempe and did not return. Sullivan said Grzelcyk is being evaluated for an upper-body injury.
“When you go down to five that early in the game, that's not easy,” Sullivan said. “Those guys are playing bigger minutes and different spots than we prefer to play them in, but I thought they all stepped up.”
As Hayes said, losing two in a row coming off the break wasn’t the plan. The Penguins need every point they can get if they want to remain in contention for a playoff spot.
“Listen, we understand where we're at,” Sullivan said. “We know that every game is important. Every two points are important. We're just going to stay in the moment and keep fighting, and we're going to fight till the very end. We're going to do everything we can to stay in the race here.
“I thought we fought hard tonight. We didn't get the result. We got to figure out where we go from here. But it's not doom and gloom. I think this group understands that that type of an attitude doesn't get us anywhere. So, we're going to have to dig in here. We'll keep fighting. We'll keep battling. We'll try to get the result the next game.”

TITLE: Penguins Gain Skilled Forward in Tommy Novak | Pittsburgh Penguins

Tommy Novak was just sitting on his couch, watching TV at home in Nashville when he got the news that he’d been traded to Pittsburgh on Wednesday.
He traveled to Vegas to meet the team on Thursday, and debuted with the Penguins on Friday in their game against the Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.
“I wasn't really expecting it. It came up on me quick,” said Novak, wearing No. 18 for his new club. “Left the next day, and now we're here. It's exciting. I'm excited to get going, for sure.”

Novak adds some center depth to the group, lining up in the middle behind Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, with Danton Heinen on his left and Emil Bemstrom on his right in Pittsburgh’s 4-0 loss ( full recap here ).
“You can see the skill level he has,” Head Coach Mike Sullivan said. “He gets a Grade-A look on a 2-on-1. Just misses his mark. But he made a few plays. He has good tight-area skills. I think he skates well. There’s a lot to like there.”
Pittsburgh’s Hockey Operations group was thrilled to bring Novak into the mix. At 27 years old, he’s a younger member of this particular group. He has good size at 6-1 and 179 pounds, and produced some solid campaigns in Nashville, who drafted him in the third round back in 2015. After four years of college hockey at Minnesota, Novak made his NHL debut in 2021.
Since then, only three Predators have scored more goals or notched more points than Novak. His best season came during the 2023-24 campaign where he set career highs across the board in goals (18), assists (27) and points (45). While this year has been a relatively down one for Novak, he still picked up 13 goals in 52 games before the trade.
“I think as a puck carrier, I see the ice well and try to make plays offensively,” Novak said. “This year, it's been a little hard to come by, but I think just making plays offensively, I move my feet, get my feet into it, and just try to create some chances for my teammates and for myself.”
While Sullivan said they were looking forward to familiarizing themselves even more with Novak’s game, Phil Tomasino knows it pretty well, having played with him in the Predators organization.
“He's an awesome player, obviously an awesome guy as well,” Tomasino said. “Just so skilled with the puck. I got the chance to play with him quite a bit in Nashville, in the minors and with the big club as well. Just makes plays. I mean, he's so silky with the puck and just makes everyone around him better. So, we're really excited to have him.”
Tomasino reached out to Novak right away, as his trade to Pittsburgh back in November was also the first of his career. But just like Tomasino, he’s looking forward to a fresh start after some tough sledding.
“Obviously, things didn't go to plan at all. So, changes were made. I'm in Pittsburgh now, and I'm excited to be here for sure,” Novak said. “Coming to such a storied franchise and to play with such great players – it's an honor to play for this franchise. I'm really excited to get going.”

TITLE: Penguins Re-Sign Defenseman Ryan Shea to a One-Year Contract Extension | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
The Pittsburgh Penguins have re-signed defenseman Ryan Shea to a one-year contract extension, it was announced today by President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Kyle Dubas.
The contract runs through the 2025-26 season and carries an average annual value of $900,000.
Shea, 28, has played in 28 games with Pittsburgh this season, tallying career highs across the board with two goals, three assists and five points. The defenseman recorded his first career two-goal game on February 23 against the New York Rangers and skated in a career-high 23:48 minutes on March 2 against Toronto.
Shea has played in 59 career NHL games, all with Pittsburgh over the past two seasons, and has tallied three goals, three assists and six points.
The 6-foot-2, 200-pound defenseman has appeared in 186 career American Hockey League games between the Texas Stars and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, totaling 72 points (12G-60A).
The Milton, Massachusetts native played four seasons (2016-20) with Northeastern University (NCAA). Shea was originally drafted by Chicago in the fourth round (121st overall) of the 2015 NHL Draft.

TITLE: Penguins Ready to Shift from Asset Collection to Execution | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Over the last year, Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas and his staff have accrued assets, flexibility and cap space as they work to return the Penguins to contention as soon as possible.
This week alone, which culminated with the NHL trade deadline on Friday, Pittsburgh collected a number of draft picks after the moves they made – which were:
At this point, no team has more draft picks or selections in the first three rounds over the next three NHL Drafts than Pittsburgh. “Triples of the third (round) of (2025), triples of the second (round) in (2026) and triples again of the third (round) of (2027). Triples is best,” Dubas said with a smile.
Now, the Penguins will start executing on the haul they’ve collected, guided by this main question: what’s in the best interest of the team? For example, it won’t be feasible for the Penguins to use every single draft pick and expect all of those players to become part of the club sooner rather than later. Instead, they’ll make picks available for trade.
“If there are opportunities to use the excess capital that we’ve accumulated, whether it’s cap space or draft picks or to add players to the program to help propel it ahead, we won’t hesitate to do that,” said Dubas, who understands that being sellers at the trade deadline is not what fans are used to in Pittsburgh, and said this can’t be the norm every year.
“I think I’ve always come in and said there is no ambition on my end to have this take any longer than it needs to take, both for the city and for the people who have put in a lot. That’s not just players, but staff that has been around for a long time. There is a certain level, and when the level drops off, you don’t want the standards and the core ideology to erode. That’s what we worked towards each day.”
The goal, said Dubas, is to try and build a group around the core players – starting with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, with Erik Karlsson, Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell included in that mix – and give them one or two more chances to win while they’re still on their current contracts, which have varying timelines.
That being said, Dubas made a point to emphasize that they won’t necessarily turn around and spend all of their assets this summer, saying that some patience is still required, and that expectations must be tempered.
“We're going to survey the landscape as urgently as we can each day to find moves that can best help propel the team ahead,” Dubas said. “If there aren't moves available, we will execute on these picks with our personnel staff – with (director of professional personnel) Andy Saucier and (vice president of player personnel) Wes Clark – to make sure we're bringing the best young talent that we can.
“How it lines up with the older players, all I can give is my pledge that we are going through everything we can to attempt to have them all have one last chance, or multiple, depending on how long they play. I'm not going to start to doubt with these guys.”
In the meantime, Dubas said the message to Pittsburgh’s roster moving forward through the rest of the season is that they expect the standards to be upheld, and they expect the players to come in, play hard and be at their best every single day.
“There’s a massive amount of opportunities for these guys who are on short-term deals or that have aspirations to remain in the league,” Dubas said. “For the guys who have been up and down in the minors or here, for the new players coming in (like) Connor Dewar and Conor Timmins, Tommy Novak – it’s a great opportunity to assert themselves for where they want to be next season. They’re all under team control. We have huge expectations in Wilkes-Barre for what they’re going to do the rest of the year, as well.
“I know it’s not typical and we won’t allow it to become typical, but I do think this remaining five or six weeks is a great opportunity for the organization and the players within to show us that they are a part of bringing us back into contention.”
Dubas also went into specifics on a few players, starting with the ones whose names came up the most in trade rumors. Here’s what he had to say about those guys...
RICKARD RAKELL: “He is a big part of our program. … Everyone has seen this year - he’s got a long history of the type of player that he is – but we see him every day, the type of person he his as well. When you have players that perform that way on a game-in, game-out basis that show the ability to respond when things don’t go well then can propel themselves back into being near the top of the league and perform at that level, it’s not something that you – especially when you have them signed and they want to be a part of the community, they want to be part of the program, they know the path that we’re on and they want to be a part of helping to bring the team back to being in contention – I would say that you don’t just push that out the door because that may be what’s wanted. You have to do what’s right for the Pittsburgh Penguins. And for us, having Rickard Rakell as part of the Pittsburgh Penguins was definitely the right thing to do as we measured it up against everything. We’re happy to have him, he’s a big part of what we do and I know he really wants to be here.”
MATT GRZELCYK: “There was interest, teams kicking tires, but in the end, we got through the deadline and he remains a member of our team. We expect him to continue to have a strong season and when we brought him in, I pledged that we would give him the opportunity to get things back rolling. He's taken advantage of that. We'll continue to push him to do so here through the last stretch of the year."
ERIK KARLSSON: “He came in the same summer I did. The team is coming out of missing the playoffs. The attempt was to bring him in and the things we did in the summer of '23 to try to get a run, that was the strategy. Try to give it one jolt to try to propel it back in. It didn't work. So, Erik, to me, it's really from a team perspective, not having to do with Erik. The team is not in the contending space that it was in for the decades prior, frankly. So, with him, he's such a talented player. I know, night in and night out, like our team has, it can be a little up and down. But the skating continues to be some of the best in the league. Obviously, offensively and puck movement continues to be at that level. We have to keep pushing him. I think he can be a part of helping our team continue to move along. So, I don't sense with his skating or his talent and ability that there's going to be any real dropoff. There was no discussion, there was nothing taken to him about waiving his no-move. And he's not a player that we would look to just move along. He's a hugely valuable player in the league. I think we'll be here and we'll be in the marketplace come summer or next year, depending on where we're at."

Late in the second period of Pittsburgh’s game against Toronto, Matthew Knies capitalized on a turnover at his own blue line, went down and scored with 0.1 seconds on the clock.
It was the second of two goals in that final minute for Toronto, who turned a 4-3 deficit into a 5-4 lead going into that intermission. But the Penguins regrouped and found a goal just 10 seconds into the third off the stick of Rickard Rakell, and managed to get one point in their 6-5 overtime loss.
“Yeah, I mean, it was the worst-case scenario there, but we had two ways to go between the second and third period,” said Rakell, who scored twice in the contest. “We could either try to respond or just give up, so, I thought we played a better third period and it kept us in the game. They're a good team, but tough not to get the two points.”

After going down 2-0 to Boston on Saturday, the Penguins talked about wanting to have a better start in the second half of this back-to-back. Unfortunately, they found themselves down by that same score early in the game, but this time, did a much better job of responding – scoring three straight goals to take the lead.
Auston Matthews, one of the NHL’s best goal scorers, evened it up just 4:08 into the middle frame, but Bryan Rust answered with less than five minutes to go before the tide turned late.
“I thought for a lot of the night we were pretty good,” Rust said. “When we did make mistakes, they were fairly big mistakes. And they’ve got some guys who can score some goals over there.”
Rookie goalie Joel Blomqvist stopped 27 shots for the Penguins after playing well in a relief performance on Tuesday against the Flyers. He made some timely saves throughout the night against a team filled with high-end talent, calling it a good opportunity to learn and grow.
“Joel's a young kid and he's trying to find his way and establish himself in this league,” Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. “It's a hard league, and so we recognize that we're going to go through some ups and downs. He's no different than any other young kid that's trying to compete. But he's a very good goalie, we believe he has great potential moving forward.”
Here are a couple of notes from the game.
500 CLUB
With his goal in the first period, Rakell became the fastest to reach 500 career points among active Swedish-born players.
He is the 37 th Swedish-born player in NHL history to reach it, and among the 12 active Swedes with 500 career points, Rakell is the eighth-fastest to get it.
“Obviously, lucky enough to play in this league for a long time,” Rakell said. “It’s a big milestone for myself.”
MOVING UP THE RANKS
With a goal and two helpers, tonight marked Sidney Crosby’s 185 th career three-point game, which is the fifth most in NHL history. Crosby has points in his last seven-consecutive home games played dating back to February 1 (3G-7A-10PTS).
Crosby’s 611th career goal allowed him to surpass Bobby Hull (610) for sole possession of 18th place on the NHL’s all-time goals list. And with his 1,050 th career helper, which came on Rust’s goal, the captain cracked the NHL’s top-10 all-time assists list – moving past a fellow all-time great in Gordie Howe. Crosby is the only active player in the top-10 on the NHL’s all-time assists list and the NHL’s all-time points list (9th).
“He's incredible,” said Maple Leafs forward William Nylander, who ranks second in the NHL with 35 goals on the season. “He's one of the best players to ever play. I'm not surprised that he's playing the way he is. He's an incredible player."
“He's still just as skilled. It was hard defending him today,” Knies said. “He was making plays. I think he's been remarkable for their team and their success. So, it's fun to play against him, for sure."

TITLE: Penguins "Simply Weren't Good Enough" in Philadelphia | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
The Penguins dropped the first game of a home-and-home with the Flyers on Tuesday at Wells Fargo Center, 6-1.
“I don’t think we played particularly good today,” Erik Karlsson said. “It’s unfortunate... it’s one of those nights where it didn’t feel like we had much of anything... they did everything better than we did tonight.”
The Penguins were coming off a strong performance against the Rangers on Sunday, where they played well but didn’t get the result they deserved in a 5-3 loss. Head Coach Mike Sullivan actually felt like his group did carry over some good energy into tonight’s start, and while they got down 2-0 in the first 12-plus minutes, there was still a lot of hockey left to be played.
Phil Tomasino got Pittsburgh within one just over six minutes into the second to give him three goals and five points in his last seven games. However, the Flyers regained their two-goal lead a few minutes later – and doubled that at the end of the period. Philadelphia tallied twice in 11 seconds to make it 5-1 going into the intermission.
“We're right there, and then we proceed to not win puck battles, be careless with the puck,” Sullivan said. “It's just not a recipe for success. If you don't manage the puck in this game and you don't play straight ahead, you're going to give teams easy offense. And that's what we did.”
Alex Nedeljkovic took complete ownership after the game, describing how he should have come up with saves on those goals and saying the guys deserve better from him. “Just frustrated right now. I don’t know what else to say. It’s disappointing,” he said.
But Sullivan wouldn’t let Nedeljkovic shoulder the blame.
“Listen, the goaltending had nothing to do with it tonight,” Sullivan said. “We simply weren’t good enough as a team.”
The Penguins return home to host the Flyers on Thursday, with puck drop scheduled for 7:30 PM at PPG Paints Arena. All they can do is look at that one game in front of them as they try to stay in the fight for a playoff spot and snap this four-game losing streak.
“We know the position that we're in,” Karlsson said. “If you start thinking big picture, it might get a little bit discouraging. We can't let that happen. We still got a lot of hockey left, and we got a good group of guys in here, and we just got to stay in the moment and try and find it for each day. Today, obviously, we fell short on that.”
Lineup Notes
*Bryan Rust returned to action after missing the last two games due to illness, and the last game before the break – also in Philadelphia – with a lower-body injury.
*Matt Grzelcyk was good to go following a hit from Matt Rempe in the first period of Sunday’s matchup with the Rangers that sent Penguins defenseman to the locker room for the remainder of the day.
“It was kind of just like a scary kind of incident, probably more just caught me by surprise than anything,” Grzelcyk said. “I never touched the puck, I never had possession of the puck. So, in that spot, I don’t think I’m really expecting to get finished there. If anything, maybe rubbed out. I think his teammate had the puck the whole time through the neutral zone and dumped it in. I chased it from the other corner. I know he’s a big man, but probably think you’ve got to have a little bit more awareness in situations. He’s coming from my blind side there, so I’m not really expecting to take a big hit in that position.”

TITLE: Penguins' Strong Effort Not Enough Against Avs | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Before Pittsburgh hit the road for a three-game trip, Bryan Rust acknowledged how difficult this time of year is, especially with the team struggling to find results ahead of the upcoming trade deadline.
“For us, we’ve just got to keep taking it one day at a time,” the longtime Penguins forward said. “I think we’ve got to just get through this week. We’ve got to stay together as a team. And just take each day as it comes.”
The Penguins did a tremendous job of that on Tuesday in Colorado, their last game before the deadline hits at Friday at 3 PM Eastern time, where they played much better than the final score indicated.
It was a one-goal game for most of the night before the Avalanche converted a late power play and tacked on a couple of empty-netters for a 4-1 win. Rickard Rakell tallied for Pittsburgh, while Alex Nedeljkovic made 21 saves.
“I loved our team game,” Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. “I thought the guys played hard tonight. There was structure. There was collective effort in all three zones. I thought it was a good hockey game for 56 minutes. Got an unfortunate penalty late in the game. Our penalty kill has an opportunity to get it done and we don’t. But overall, I thought the team game was really good.”
The Penguins had a particularly strong opening frame, an area they’ve been vocal about wanting to improve. They had given up at least one first-period goal in the previous nine games.
After a scoreless first period, Colorado opened the scoring in the second with a goal from Artturi Lehkonen, who buried a feed from Nathan MacKinnon on a sequence started by Cale Makar.
“We just got stuck out there for a little bit,” Sidney Crosby said. “Obviously, they're dangerous. We were just a little bit out of position there. They find holes, they find seams, and that's what they did. But I thought for the most part, they're a really good team off the rush and in-zone, and for the most part, we did a pretty good job.”
Crosby’s line tied it up late in the second period, with the captain earning the secondary assist after Rust set up Rickard Rakell for a tap-in at the blue paint.
That was Rakell’s 29 th goal of the season, bringing him one shy of his third career 30-goal campaign. Rust, who suited up for his 620th game as a Penguin, surpassed Ron Schock for the 10th-most games played in franchise history. Rust extended his point streak to seven games against Colorado (4G-4A-8PTS).
They couldn’t find a power-play goal on two tries in the second period, and after Anthony Beauvillier was called for tripping with just over five minutes to go in regulation, the Avalanche converted. The Penguins then couldn’t convert with the extra attacker in the last minute-plus.
“It's one of those games that you hope you find a way to win it because we did a lot of good things,” Crosby said. “Unfortunately, we didn't, and it's been kind of going that way since the break - where we've put some really good games together and feel like we deserve better, but you don't get participation points. So, you gotta find a way to win games.”
Note: Defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok made his Penguins debut tonight after being claimed off of waivers from Utah last month. The coaching staff had been trying to familiarize themselves with his game before inserting him into the lineup.
“I thought Vlady was good,” Sullivan said. “His mobility was evident. It was hard to get a read on his overall game, because we haven't had too many practices, and the ones we've had have been more recovery skates than anything. It was nice to see him in a game, and I thought he was getting back to pucks. I thought he made some really nice plays with the puck. He defended well with his stick, but his mobility was probably the thing that jumped out at me the most.”

TITLE: Pittsburgh Celebrates Mike Lange's Life and Legacy | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
While Saturday was an afternoon puck drop, it still felt like “A Hockey Night in Pittsburgh” as the Penguins community celebrated the life and legacy of Hall of Fame broadcaster Mike Lange, who died on Wednesday.
"Obviously, he was a great person and means a lot to a lot of people – here, the organization, the fans, the city,” Sidney Crosby said. “I think the tribute was really nice and to have his family here to recognize him. He's going to be missed, for sure."
The Penguins captain, along with Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, joined Lange’s two sons, Tanner and Ian, and their families at the Zamboni gate. A few members of Lange’s broadcast family – Joe Brand, Josh Getzoff, Eddie Olcyzk, Paul Steigerwald, and of course, Phil Bourque – came onto the ice as well.
“Our guests on the ice represent the multitudes of people Mike loved and influenced throughout his life,” read PA announcer Ryan Mill. “His family, broadcasters he worked with and mentored, players and the games he covered, as well as you the fans and his listening audience across the airwaves.
“It’s been said that ‘Grief is the price we pay for love.’ Well, that is certainly true in Mike’s case. Mike loved broadcasting, and we loved his gift to bring the game and all its color to life as only he could. And while his passing brings a sadness that cannot be overstated, we all know he would much rather we celebrate his legacy and the role he played creating Penguins hockey memories that will last with us forever.”
At that point, a beautifully done video played for everyone in the arena, before a moment of celebration for Lange’s life that was incredibly emotional. Ian Lange held up a sign that read, ‘Thank You Pittsburgh’ as applause and cheers rang out through the building.

While the lights went back up, a booth on the Mike Lange Media Level stayed dark, save for one desk lamp that he used while calling games - along with his iconic headphones. During the game, players on both the Penguins and the Capitals wore stickers on their helmets honoring Lange that featured his headset. He preferred a particular style that become old school as he progressed along in his career.

Those headphones were also part of a special display at the Highmark Stage, where fans were invited to stop by and pay their respects.
“Hearing him on the call, it was just Penguins hockey,” said Duane Thomas from Olean, N.Y.
Lange's impact on the city of Pittsburgh was felt by Thomas, even from out-of-state.
“I'm not from Pittsburgh, but I believe he was part of the heart of what Pittsburgh is,” he said.
Vince DiAngelo from Clairton, PA, seconded that. “He's on the Mount Rushmore of people (in Pittsburgh),” he said.

“Get in the fast lane, grandma!”
“He smoked him like a bad cigar!”
“Elvis has left the building!”
Those were some of the sayings that fans wrote on posters at the DICK's Sporting Goods Hallway of Champions, as the Penguins provided materials to create signs honoring Lange, and encouraged those attending to bring them into the building as well.
“He really brought the game alive,” Laurel George from Plum, PA, said while getting choked up after jotting down her favorite Lange phrase, “He beat him like a rented mule!”
“His enthusiasm and his accuracy in making any call was just out of this world,” George said.
Let’s fill @PPGPaintsArena with some Lange love at today’s game! Fans are encouraged to bring signs featuring their favorite Mike Lange phrases or create one in the @DICKS Sporting Goods Hallway of Champions. pic.twitter.com/lwOPzyGoUF
Lange had a special saying for the captain, “Slap me silly, Sidney!” – so it just felt right that Crosby got on the board. So did another member of the Big Three, Letang, with Malkin earning the primary assist. He said yesterday that he would have a milkshake in Mike’s honor.
“I think everyone in Pittsburgh knows his voice, you know? He’s probably the most popular voice in Pittsburgh,” Malkin said. “He’s a great guy. I know he is sick the last couple of years. Tough loss for the whole organization. It’s hard to say anything right now... I met him a couple times, he say, ‘Malkin, make me a milkshake!’ It’s great words for me. It’s a tough loss, but I hope his family is good.”

TITLE: Pittsburgh Penguins Contribute $500,000 to Renovate Ammon Recreation Center in Hill District | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
The Pittsburgh Penguins today announced a $500,000 investment to support a full refurbishment of the Ammon Recreation Center in the Hill District, ensuring the facility continues to serve as a vital hub for youth and community programs. The funding will contribute to a city-led renovation project that will modernize the center, preserve its historic significance, and expand resources for local families.
“We know Ammon has been a cornerstone of the Hill District for generations, and we want to make sure it stays that way,” said Penguins Alternate Governor Teddy Werner. “Strong communities are built around places like this – where kids play, families gather, and neighbors connect. This investment is about preserving an institution that means so much to this neighborhood and ensuring it continues to serve future generations.”
Located just a few blocks from PPG Paints Arena, the Ammon Recreation Center has long been a cornerstone of the Hill District, offering sports, educational programs, and a space for community events. Built in the 1940’s on the site of the historic Ammon Field, the facility has provided generations of residents with opportunities to grow, connect, and take pride in their neighborhood.
This latest investment builds on the Penguins’ previous $100,000 contribution in 2020, which helped establish a Rec2Tech computer lab to bridge the digital divide for local students and families.
The Penguins’ commitment to Ammon is part of a broader strategy to support economic and community development in the region. Over the years, the team has worked with partners to help secure funding for Frankie Pace Park, contribute millions to the Greater Hill District Reinvestment Fund, and allocate significant contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses through major projects like the recently-opened FNB Financial Center and the forthcoming Music Venue development.

TITLE: Pittsburgh Pennies Legacy Lives On | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Members of the original Pittsburgh Pennies, established in 1972 as the city’s first women’s hockey team, were in the building on Sunday for the seventh annual Her Hockey Game presented by 84 Lumber – which recognized the incredible passion of women fans during the NHL’s Celebrating Women’s History Month. Seeing all of the support in the arena held a lot of weight.
“It means a lot to young girls in attendance,” said Patti Gaab, who was a part of that group, which was comprised of players aged 9 to 50 and competed in the Mid-Atlantic Women’s Hockey League across the Northeast and Canada.
“I remember going to games when I was young, and just to see that there's all this support out there for them... it's nice to see they're backed and supported. Fun day for everybody.”
The game against the Rangers kicked off the Her Hockey Auction, which runs through 12 PM on March 10. Fans can text HERHOCKEY to 76278 or visit **herhockey.givesmart.com** to contribute. The auction features Her Hockey locker room nameplates, Penguins autographed memorabilia, female featured art and more, and all proceeds will support the new Pittsburgh Pennies Girls Hockey Program, established to increase the number of girls who play hockey and to promote gender equality in the sport.
The initiative aims to build upon the Penguins’ community hockey programming, ensuring sustainable growth and widespread adoption of girls’ hockey projects. It includes a nearly $300,000 investment over two seasons from the NHL/NHLPA Industry Growth Fund and the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation.
“The Pittsburgh Pennies program is all about building a network and building a community within girls' hockey – and then, just the possibility, right?” said Shannon Webster, Penguins Senior Director of Youth Hockey. “Providing an opportunity for every girl that picks up a stick and making sure that they all feel welcome. The girls may play on different teams, but ultimately, everyone has the same goal, and that’s enjoying and loving the sport and sharing that passion.”
Girls’ hockey participation in Western Pennsylvania has increased 80% in the last 15 years, according to USA Hockey. Coming from a time when piecing together a single Pittsburgh Pennies roster was a challenge, seeing the massive growth in the area has been a delight for Gaab.
“I was one of the first people on the team organizing it, and it was a struggle,” Gaab said. “Trying to get money, we did fundraising... trying to get ice time, and getting enough girls to even play... it was a process that took a lot of time, we had no backing or support.
“I mean, we didn’t have anyone to play; we were playing boys' teams. When we played girls' teams, we had to go to Canada, Philadelphia, or New Jersey—wherever we could find teams and tournaments to play in. It’s nice seeing all the girls' teams. It’s been fun... I want to go out and see some of them play.”
That process was one fueled by passion from Gaab and her teammates, to play the game they loved, which built a community.
“It was wonderful,” Gaab said. “It was a good team-building experience just doing it all together. Just seeing where we started from and where we ended up, it was impressive.”
Now, years later, Gaab and her crew were down at ice level at PPG Paints Arena in December for the skills clinic that officially launched this iteration of the Pittsburgh Pennies , before heading up to a suite on Sunday. Seeing the Pittsburgh Pennies legacy live on through such an initiative, centered around creating opportunities for girls to enjoy the sport, is a full-circle moment for Gaab and her former teammates, who at one point were their only advocates.
“I just feel proud and honored that I had some small part in girls playing hockey, from the past to the future,” Gaab said. “I can't even imagine what it's going to be like 10 years from now.”

TITLE: Players, Coaches, Broadcasters Pay Tribute to Mike Lange | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Before Dan Bylsma arrived in Pittsburgh during the 2008-09 season, the Michigan native knew of Mike Lange’s goal calls and the color he added to Penguins broadcasts.
“‘Scratch my back with a hacksaw’ and ‘he beat him like a rented mule’ was something my family – me and my son playing knee hockey in the basement – said long before we got to Pittsburgh, in the raspy Mike Lange voice,” grinned Bylsma, who coached the Penguins to a Stanley Cup that June.
Since Lange died on Wednesday at age 76 , there have been so many stories, memories and tributes shared in his honor. It’s been such a treat to read them and listen to them, especially when those who knew and loved Lange best go into their own imitation of his unique voice that called so many iconic moments in Penguins history, gave such sound advice, and cracked so many jokes.
Players, coaches, and fellow broadcasters shared what came to mind when they thought of the Hall of Famer, who will be forever in our hearts.
Mike made such an impact on the Penguins franchise, and me personally as a player. He welcomed me to Pittsburgh. It was the little things, like words of encouragement at my stall after the media had left, a fist bump to acknowledge a big game or a wink for a special moment. He was so special and I am honored to have called Mike my friend.
I think everyone in Pittsburgh knows his voice, you know? He’s probably the most popular voice in Pittsburgh. He’s a great guy. I know he is sick the last couple of years. Tough loss for the whole organization. It’s hard to say anything right now... I met him a couple times, he say, ‘Malkin, make me a milkshake!’ It’s great words for me. It’s a tough loss, but I hope his family is good.
Mike Lange: "MAKE ME A MILKSHAKE, MALKIN!" @emalkin71geno : "Yes, sir." The milkshake was cold, but this video will surely warm your heart 💛 pic.twitter.com/zI1MnEX5QQ
That voice will always kind of resonate with the Pittsburgh Penguins and all the players, like Mario, Jagr, Sid, Geno... I was lucky myself to have my name called by him. He made it unique and fun and enjoyable to listen.
At the beginning, when he would travel with us, you kind of create a little bit of a bond. He tried to get to know you, and try to create some dialogue – get to know you, your family, where you're from. You got to a point where you felt familiar with him, like he was part of the team. (His impact is) huge. Every time you hear replays of big memories, like Stanley Cup wins or big goals by Mario or stuff like that – that's his voice. So, it means a lot for the city and for all of the players that are in this dressing room.
Being around development camps, I think I got an idea of how much he meant to the city, this organization, and everybody who is involved, top to bottom. He talked to everybody. It didn’t matter if you were a new guy, if you were a janitor in the room, if you were a media person, if you were the head coach, or if you were Sid — it didn’t matter. He genuinely had conversations with you, and when he talked to you, he listened and he cared. Then you saw his enthusiasm every time he talked about hockey and every time he talked about the city.
I think it's really, really cool to have Mike Lange call some of my goals. I think at the time, you might take it for granted a little bit. But now, looking back, you see his legacy and the overall impact that he made... then you see that, oh, he was calling plays I made, games I was in, and just so many memorable calls – especially from those Cup runs. Just the enthusiasm he had and the hilarious sayings, I think will be remembered forever.
Mike was a Penguins legend and one of the most important figures in franchise history. It was my honor to have him call virtually every goal in my career and play a key role in all five of our Stanley Cup championships. Mike was a one-of-a-kind broadcaster, a tremendous ambassador for the city of Pittsburgh, and most importantly, a great friend. He will be missed.
Some of the greatest memories that I have and some of my greatest hockey memories, Mike’s voice are attached to those. I just can’t help but think of some of his catchphrases and the passion that he brought to the job every day. He loved the Penguins, and the Penguins loved him. It’s a big loss for Pittsburgh. It’s a big loss for our organization.
He worked at (his craft). That’s why I had so much respect for him. He was at every morning skate. He would have personal conversations with players, coaches. He had a pretty good pulse on what was going on around the team at any particular team. Some of the ebbs and flows, the adversities that teams go through, he had a pretty good handle on it. That doesn’t happen by accident. You’ve got to put your time in. Mike was a guy that was willing to do that. He’d roll up his sleeves. He put the time in to be around the team and do all the background work so that when the cameras went on or they turned that microphone on, he was prepared.
When someone works at the game the way he does, in a lot of ways, you become a student of the game. He did it for a long time. Because he became a student of the game, he gained a better understanding of how the game is being played. Because of that, it allowed him to maybe engage in conversations that weren’t just stating the obvious, that maybe dug into the subtleties of the game.
I think broadcasters and announcers have a unique spot in the game, and the great ones add life and add color. Their names and what they did for the game is as high up there as the greats in the game, as Gretzky and Orr and Lemieux and Jagr. They play great hockey, and the announcers give you great hockey with their voice and with their calls. They are hockey. They are a part of hockey, and that's what Mike Lange was. And to meet him in person, he's just the same. He's a character of hockey, humble, loved the game and loved giving the game to the people. Mike will always be remembered for that. He’s a true legend.
He was a guy who I went to, and he came to me with tips. Not just tips about the game, but tips about the media, and tips about answering questions. In true Mike form, I still have a scratch piece of notebook paper with 1-10 lessons on how to deal with the media, and each one of them has a true Mike Lange color to it.
A memory for me is walking across the ice after my first win in Mellon Arena, and hearing ‘Elvis has just left the building!’ It happened right around the blue line every time. But in the new arena, I had to wait for it on the bench to hear Mike Lange's voice with the ‘Elvis has just left the building’ call. Mike Lange, for me, is a huge part of the game hockey and a huge part of Penguins history.
He was a mentor and he was a friend. When I was a kid growing up, I used to watch the Penguins on the old satellite dish in our backyard. Used to get them on KDKA. Obviously, there’s Mikey's legendary calls, but to work with him – he really helped me. Like, he taught me how to breathe when I'm on the air. He would say, ‘I want you to talk from here,’ pointing at his gut, not up in the neck and chest area. He taught me you can’t BS the fans. He took me under his wing as a young broadcaster and somebody that had played in the league a long time, and just we had fun. He helped mold me into what I could become as a broadcaster.
It was an intimidating chair to sit in, because I knew Mikey was a legend there. I think when you do work with legends like that, you know there's a time where you just let them have the stage and do what they need to do. Then, you get an opportunity to jump in and give them a breath, and they can go back to doing what they're doing, whether it was calling a game or telling a story... or Mikey leaning over to me during a commercial break and say, ‘hey, Edzo – I can see it in 66’s eyes here, you know?’ I would set him up on the other side, like, let's hope you're right! And sure enough, bam, Mario would get a goal or Jags would do what he would do.
The times that we had together traveling and in the booth, I will say that the Mike Lange on the air, personality-wise, is who Mikey was away from the rink. Everywhere we would go, he was a rock star, and people wanted his autograph, and people suggested tens of thousands of times, ‘hey, why don’t you try this saying?’ Mikey really never turned anybody away. It's just hard not to feel emotional. We all had a different view of him, and I was lucky enough to sit next to him very early in my broadcasting career, and just be a very small part of his life. We had no shortage of laughs.
We were interviewing Jags in the locker room after we won the Cup and he said, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building!’ He could barely speak English, but he was able to put that out there. That was in ’91, his rookie year. So, that was really cool. Mikey got a huge kick out of that. After we won the Cup in ’92, I had a little video camera, and he and I sat in the stands down near the ice at Chicago Stadium. I basically interviewed him. I said, well, Mikey, you've been through a lot, man. Like, this is it, you're here. You just won back-to-back Cups. It’s amazing, isn’t it, how far you’ve come? He started talking from his heart about it all, and it was a really informal, fun thing.
One of the things that people have to remember about Mikey is how much fun he had doing what he did. It was an enjoyable experience to listen to him call a hockey game. He took it extremely seriously, but there was an element of fun to it. He knew that would resonate with people. His broadcasts were very easy to listen to, and he didn't try to make it bigger than it was, but he certainly didn't diminish it at the same time. So, if it was a huge game or an incredible play, he was blown away by it, and he knew how to convey that, so that you would also be blown away by it. He gave weight to things that needed it. He did that really well with his sayings and also his tone of voice, the way he brought his voice up and the intonations. A lot of subtle things that he did with his voice that conveyed different emotions. It was like he had an instrument, like he was playing the guitar. That's what I loved about his style, it was very musical and very artistic.
He wanted it to be creatively compelling... he thought it was important to add his own flair, which not a lot of guys do. He was never afraid to step out of the normal restrictions that you seem to have when you're doing television. He could goof around a little bit, say some funny things, lighten the atmosphere. Like in Calgary, a TV had fallen and kind of grazed the side of my head and hit my shoulder. Afterwards, we staged a thing where we got some ketchup and some gauze and put it around my head, made it look like I was injured. Mike helped cook it up, and I went along with it, we had some laughs over it. That was just something we did. We weren't afraid to step out and try different creative stuff.
Something else about Mikey is that he was fun to be around. Traveling with him, he was always hilarious. If there was something that bothered him, he would complain about it, but it was all kind of in good fun. He was never really mad. He was just kind of putting on a show for everybody. On the road, he would go off on his own. He liked to eat late at night. He would take a towel from the hotel bathroom, put it across the end of the bed like a tablecloth, and then he set his food on that. So, he'd sit on his bed and he'd eat his late-night food. Then he'd go to bed, get up in the morning and go to the morning skate, take a nice nap in the afternoon and be ready to roll.
He treated me like a son, and it was in different phases. I first met him when I was working for the Islanders. It was 2006, and this was my chance, finally , to meet my idol. The whole reason I got into this business was him. So, he rolled in like the fog, like he said, at Nassau Coliseum – long green trench coat – and he knew that he was my idol, so he gave me a little extra time. He knew I was from Pittsburgh, and it was real special to do a Penguin-Islander game and to meet him. So, he always took a little extra time.
Then, it was working for the Penguins. That was just so incredibly special, to be a part of the team and for him to just take me under his wing and pass along all these little pearls of wisdom that he had. I still remember so many of them to this day that I appreciate, like, take an extra second, make sure you have the right player: 71, not 72, you know? Just those little things. He was a great influence, great friend, mentor. Just a generous, kind soul, and he was just a master at his craft. That's really what it was. He was so dedicated to that art form of calling a game on radio or TV, doing play-by-play. Of course, he did other sports, not just hockey, but specialized in calling hockey.
But I think my favorite memories are actually not even at the rink or in the booth. It's going to the casino with him. There he was at the video roulette machine, having his Miller Lite and his cigarette. Those quirks about him and the memories that come to mind aren't calling Game 1 of the ’92 Final, even though those were, of course, big moments, and they'll live forever. But the ones that I remember are just getting the bat signal at 1 AM, you’ve got to come out to Rivers Casino and join him for some video roulette!
The few times that I got to travel with him, we actually sat next to each other, and that was just a dream. Though one time on the plane, my electric toothbrush was going off in my suitcase, and one of the flight attendants went on the loudspeaker and said, ‘If you have a black bag with the initials S and M, your bag is vibrating, come to the front.’ Sid is the first one who stands up and points and laughs, Justin Schultz is crying. I’m walking down the aisle, like, ‘IT’S A TOOTHBRUSH! IT’S A TOOTHBRUSH!’ I couldn't sink in my seat any lower, like, can I just go out on the wing and stay there? And there Mikey was again to console me, with words of wisdom and comfort. Just patting me on the knee, saying, ‘It's all right. Oh, that's funny, you fancy TV guys use electric toothbrushes now. Yeah, no big deal.’ He was the best.
I can’t adequately express how much Mike Lange meant to me… a friend, mentor & he treated me like a son. I love this photo cause he’s giving me advice (as usual) & I’m loving it. His iconic calls and that incredible voice will live forever. Have a Miller Lite tonight and Smile. pic.twitter.com/aANUHzWJX0
One of my biggest memories is when I first met him. When I got hired, the last day of training camp was my first day. So, the team was established, everyone's been around each other, and I’m just rolling in. Like, I don't know anybody, I've never met anybody. But I knew who Mike was, and I was so intimidated by him because of who he was. I remember him coming over, he had that giant trench coat even though it was like, 90 degrees outside. He and Bourquey came over and introduced themselves. He’s like, how old are you? I’m like, I'm 27. He's like, that's how old I was when I came here!
I didn't notice it in the moment, because there's so much going on when you move here, and you’re like, I'm in the NHL, this is crazy! But once you think back, he clearly saw something that I didn't realize that he saw. Because from that point forward, he would text me - what are the line combinations? What's going on? He was always on top of things, wanting to know what I think about things. He gave me guidance and he gave me advice, but he never told me what to do. He’d be like, here's something to think about. I just feel like from the start to him finishing here, when I was on, he was always eager to help. He never said no. He always responded. I actually thought he went out of his way a lot of times.
I was doing Devils and Mike was doing Penguins. There was a game at the old Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey, the old place seated 19,000. I imagine there were 12,000 there that night. It was back in the day when teams played a five-minute overtime, and if neither team won, there was no shootout; it just went as a tie.
So, it got into overtime, and future Hall of Famers were all over the ice. Martin Brodeur, our goaltender in New Jersey, was in the net and Mario got a breakaway in overtime. Marty stopped him and trailing Mario on the play was Jaromir Jagr. He picked up the loose puck and Marty stopped him, too. Of course, the crowd that was there went nuts because it persevered the tie and eventually, it became a tie.
After the game was over, Mike and I are down on the loading dock. Mike is waiting for the team bus, and I'm about to get in the car and go home. I said, “it was a lot of fun, wasn't it?” He said, “It's a blessing.” And then there was a pause, and then he said, “Why is it always so cold in here?!” And I said, “Well I don't know, management seems to think it makes for better ice.” But anyway, we had that moment where we shared the joy of doing our work and then there came the reality, “why am I standing here shivering?"
Bourque joined Lange as his color analyst in the radio booth in the 2006-07 season. They were broadcast partners until Lange retired in 2021. The Hall of Famer and the Old 29er were close friends and had such a bond. Bourque went on WDVE to share all sorts of reflections on Lange, both professionally and personally. It’s fantastic stuff that will make you both smile like a butcher's dog and cry instead of winding your watch. The full interview is here .

TITLE: The Voice of the Penguins: Remembering Mike Lange | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
Mike Lange, who spent 46 years behind the mic for the Pittsburgh Penguins as one of the most unique broadcasters in professional sports – known for his colorful, creative style and trademark sayings – died on Wednesday. He was 76.
“Mike Lange is the voice of the Pittsburgh Penguins,” said Phil Bourque, who was his longtime partner in the booth, after his retirement in 2021 . “When it comes to his legacy, Mikey is the one that's called the final call for all five (Stanley) Cups. It doesn't matter who has ever broadcast before and who will broadcast in the future: Mike Lange is the voice of the Pittsburgh Penguins.”
Lange took his place on the city’s Mount Rushmore of sports broadcasters for his impact on the hockey club, which began with him taking the team through rough times in their early years. Lange got the people of Pittsburgh invested with his talent and originality, and became incredibly popular around town.
As the Penguins became blessed with some of the greatest to ever play, Lange translated their on-ice magic to the fans who adored him. The Hockey Hall of Fame recognized Lange with their Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, for members of the industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession.
“Mike was a Penguins legend and one of the most important figures in franchise history,” said Mario Lemieux. “It was my honor to have him call virtually every goal in my career and play a key role in all five of our Stanley Cup championships. Mike was a one-of-a-kind broadcaster, a tremendous ambassador for the city of Pittsburgh, and most importantly, a great friend. He will be missed.”
Bourque, who played for the Penguins from 1983-92, always regretted not getting to know Lange better during those days. “He was always good to me, we always had pleasant interactions,” Bourque said. “But I didn't really know much about him, and now that I know his story, I wish I had known it 30 years ago.”
It began out West, growing up as a fifth-generation Californian and baseball fan in the northern part of his home state. Lange always loved listening to Bill King, legendary voice of the MLB’s Oakland Athletics who also called games for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders and the San Francisco/Golden State Warriors. Lange knew when he was just 9 years old that not only did he want to be an announcer, like King, he wanted to use, as he put it, “a phrase or two” during his calls.
Hockey, however, was a sport Lange wasn’t initially familiar with. But some cajoling from his friend Len Shapiro led to Lange becoming synonymous with the game. Both broadcasting majors at Sacramento State University, Shapiro was working with the local ice hockey association. He asked Lange to attend a game with him, and possibly work it.
“Red line, blue line, I know nothing,” Lange said.
“Come anyway,” Shapiro responded. “You never know.”
As fate would have it, Lange ended up becoming the penalty timekeeper alongside the PA announcer, who wanted a raise from $5 to $10 per game for the following season. The league, a small one with minimal means, approached Lange and asked if he’d do the job at the less expensive rate. After quickly doing the math, and realizing he’d have enough money for a Shakey’s pizza and a pitcher of beer with some cash left over, Lange enthusiastically accepted.
He convinced his college advisor to broadcast the playoff games over the college radio station and called them, took the tapes, and mailed a bunch to various sports, leagues, and teams. The only response Lange received came from the Phoenix Roadrunners of the Western Hockey League, saying that while nothing was open at the moment, they enjoyed his work.
Lange took a leap of faith and moved to Arizona anyway. Legendary Phoenix Suns broadcaster Al McCoy, then the Roadrunners’ play-by-play man, took Lange under his wing and allowed him to do color commentary. With the help of McCoy, the players, and the coaches, Lange learned the intricacies of the game and honed his craft. He parlayed that into a gig back home in California as the play-by-play voice for the WHL’s San Diego Gulls before the league folded. Once again, Lange sent out his work – and once again, fate intervened.
After Pittsburgh station KDKA received Lange’s letter, his relationship with the Penguins began, as the team was looking for an announcer. He was one of three finalists for the gig alongside Mike ‘Doc’ Emrick. While Emrick also went on to become a Hall of Fame broadcaster, he harbored no hard feelings about the decision. “I’ve said it often – they got the right guy,” Emrick chuckled.
“He was relatable,” Emrick continued. “Pittsburgh is a wonderful city I always felt was a collection of neighborhoods, and he seemed to have a way of relating to all of that. It was a style that people really liked.”
While Emrick had some familiarity with the place, Lange really didn’t know what he was coming into as far as a market. But, as he once grinned, “I walk in and Bob Prince is here, I walk in and Myron Cope is here… they were significantly different types of broadcasters. And now, I arrive on the scene. So, I was in the right place.”
Lange broke into the NHL during the 1974-75 season at just 26 years old, calling games for a fledgling franchise that had some exciting talent on the ice, but financial troubles off the ice. They filed for bankruptcy, which led to Lange being sidelined for the following season. Fortunately, he returned in 1976, and this time, remained in Pittsburgh for good. He did radio exclusively by himself in the booth until 1979, when games were simulcast on radio and TV.
A bit of an old soul who was both charismatic and eccentric, Lange quickly found a groove as the Penguins tried to find their footing following 1967’s expansion. With his ability to use the tones, texture and volume in his voice to build anticipation, he’d bring people to the edge of their seats before delivering calls that would have them jumping to their feet.
Paul Steigerwald, a student at Kent State University during Lange’s first years on the job, remembers becoming invested because of him. “My buddies and I were really enthralled with Mike Lange and the way he called games,” Steigerwald said.
After years of trying to sell the game and attract fans into the building – “you’d have to be here to believe it!” he often cried – Lange had the honor of calling the entirety of Mario Lemieux’s career after the greatest pure goal scorer in the history of the game got drafted first overall by the Penguins in 1984.
It was rewarding for Lange to watch No. 66 lead the franchise to its first Stanley Cup in 1991 after all of its challenges, and Lemieux’s goal in Game 1 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Final against Chicago always ranked as the most memorable goal he ever called.
Though Lange always prided himself on having concentration, focus and a feel for the game, striking the right balance between professionalism and excitement, he joked that his voice might have failed him if he’d needed to call another tally. That’s how much the moment affected him.
“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing when you have a moment like that. To see a comeback and to see a victory and to see the player that did it all come your way at the same time, it’ll make you smile like a butcher’s dog,” Lange said, with a smile of his own.
The great McCoy served as another inspiration for Lange’s sayings, which he sprinkled into early broadcasts. Some were his own, and others came from the people of Pittsburgh. “Buy Sam a Drink and Get His Dog One Too” was overheard from a bartender; a bookmaker came up with “get in the fast lane, Grandma, the bingo game is ready to roll”; while “Scratch My Back with a Hacksaw” was suggested by a mall security guard.
Fans caught onto the phrases and loved them, approaching Lange around what he called “a town of characters” with their submissions in hopes they’d make the broadcasts. It got to the point where Lange adopted a rule that folks had to write down their submissions, which he kept in a shoebox, and he’d take them under advisement. Even Jaromir Jagr himself got in on it!
Lange sat next to the future Hall of Famer on the team bus early in his career, helping the young, homesick phenom feel comfortable and understood. Eventually, Jagr asked if he could give Lange a saying to use on the air after workshopping it for some time, which ended up being, “he smoked him like a bad cigar!”
They helped keep things interesting during the lean years, before Lemieux and Jagr turned the phrases into legitimate expressions of disbelief, as those players were just so skilled that Lange and the fans would just blurt out whatever popped into their minds.
Lange often credited the players for his success, and expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to call their games. But for their part, they understood how fortunate they were to have someone like Lange narrating their accomplishments, and he had their utmost respect for his ability and his character. Jagr even made sure to acknowledge him during his recent jersey retirement ceremony.
Lange served as the television voice of the Penguins through 2005-06, before returning to the radio booth in 2006-07, which was the first season of the team’s 16-year playoff streak. He called games alongside Bourque for the entirety of that run.  No NHL team was more dominant over that stretch, and they were fortunate to have a Hall of Famer providing the soundtrack.
“Mike made such an impact on the Penguins franchise, and me personally as a player,” Sidney Crosby said. “He welcomed me to Pittsburgh. It was the little things, like words of encouragement at my stall after the media had left, a fist bump to acknowledge a big game or a wink for a special moment. He was so special and I am honored to have called Mike my friend.”
His signature calls are what Bourque missed the most when Lange retired in 2021.
“Sometimes they would take a while to unravel, and I had the luxury to kind of just sit there and soak it in and watch him,” Bourque said. “And at times, he would have his eyes closed, and he's just looking up to the heavens, and is like, ‘heeeeee shoots and scoresssss."’ I have the visual of him. His eyes are closed, his fists are clenched, he's got those big 1970s headphones on. And he's just going, ‘Heeeeee shoots and scoresssss.’ I just sit there. I just soak it in. It feels like it takes about three minutes for him to make the call, and it's all of like seven seconds.”
Lange likened games on radio to creating a book, which always began with him saying, “it’s a hockey night in Pittsburgh!” From there, no one knew where it was going to go, and Lange loved that he got to build chapter after chapter before Elvis left the building. What made the book better, Lange always said, was anticipation. His broadcasting partners agree that was always Lange’s biggest strength, marveling at his feel for what was going to happen before it happened, especially as someone who never laced up the skates himself or even watched the game until college.
Bourque also missed the camaraderie that came with being Lange’s partner and friend. While Lange was a private man who kept things close to the vest, he would do anything for the people he cared about and make them laugh along the way – always signing off on emails and texts with some variation of “keep smilin’ like a butcher’s dog.”
Whether it was in the booth, the press box, the back of the plane or bus, or over the phone, Lange would use that raspy voice and deep chuckle to tease, tell stories and jokes, take the edge off, and complain good-naturedly (especially if he got a room at the end of the hallway, lugging his suitcase missing a wheel he dubbed ‘the Three-Legged Dog’). Once, after playfully chastising a Penguins staffer for taking the last banana after getting to the team hotel, Lange unexpectedly popped up from behind a table on another trip with two bananas in each hand like they were guns. “Stick ‘em up!” he cackled.
During his years on the road, Lange put together a book he dubbed “Blues and Booze,” keeping a record of places he could get a bite to eat or go listen to music. Lange once said he wanted to do everything he could to try and get the blues in front of people, “because it's such a valuable part of our history. That’s kind of what keeps you going a little bit, along with companionship and friendship and a lot of laughs and a lot of good hockey games to call.”
The memory that resonated the most with Lange in his nearly five decades with the team came during the tribute for the late Bob “Badger” Johnson. The man who had a legendary catchphrase of his own – “it’s a great day for hockey!” – died of a brain tumor in the summer of 1991 after leading Pittsburgh to its first Stanley Cup in his only year as head coach.
That night was a reminder for Lange that your greatest legacy will be based on how you treated other people, and by God, was he good to those around him. Particularly in the latter stages of his career, as Lange embraced his status as somewhat of a father figure and someone for others to lean on. He offered up sound advice – both professionally and personally – in a subtle way, along with support and praise that left a remarkable impact on those who received it. Especially since there are so many people who got into the broadcasting business due to Lange's influence, and everyone around the team knew what an icon he was.
“I was so intimidated by him because of who he was,” said Josh Getzoff, who began filling in for Lange before taking over upon his retirement. “You could see how revered he was. But from start to finish, he was always eager to help. He never said no. He always responded, and I actually felt like he went out of his way a lot of times.”
And as for the people of this city – they revered Mike Lange. He understood them, and they understood him. He once said it’s not the Cups or individual magic on the ice that would stick with him forever. “I think, God, was I lucky to get to know some of these great people. God, was this whole town lucky.”
But we were the lucky ones.

TITLE: Tristan Jarry Talks Returning to Pittsburgh | Pittsburgh Penguins
CONTENT:
When Evgeni Malkin walked onto the team plane for their flight to Denver that kicked off a three-game road trip, he got a huge smile on his face when he saw Tristan Jarry.
The goaltender had just returned to Pittsburgh after getting called up from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League, where rookie Joel Blomqvist was re-assigned following a loss to Toronto on Sunday.
Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said they felt that was the best course of action for Blomqvist’s growth and development at this point in time, which means Jarry is back in the mix with Pittsburgh for the foreseeable future. He spoke after Thursday’s practice in Vegas for the first time since rejoining the group.
“I want to be here. This is where I signed, and this is where I intend to be,” said Jarry, a 2013 second-round pick who inked a five-year contract extension in the summer of 2023.
“I was drafted here, and I came up through the minors and worked my way up to Pittsburgh, and that was my goal – to be a Penguin the whole time. It’s something where I had a little bump in the road, and going down to Wilkes, I think will help my game.”

Jarry speaks to the media.
Jarry, a two-time NHL All-Star, had first reported to WBS for a two-week conditioning stint in November following a difficult start to the season. As detailed here , the Penguins hoped it would serve as a reset, and Jarry did do well – winning four of five games against good competition.
After the 14 days were up, Penguins President of Hockey Operations Kyle Dubas said they committed to giving Jarry “some good runway” in Pittsburgh. But for whatever reason, the inconsistency continued.
So, Jarry went back to WBS in January, this time with no timeline. As Dubas said then, “The job is now to go and earn his way back up. It's solely circumstantial with this.”
Jarry has now appeared in 12 total games there, posting a 6-5-1 record, a 2.67 goals-against average and a .908 save percentage, using the time to reflect and work on having his game come together. Jarry feels like he was starting to play better before getting the call-up, and hopes to continue that momentum.
“Obviously, it's not something that you want to happen, and that's on me,” Jarry said of how he approached the situation. “I wasn't playing well enough for this team, and I wasn't giving them a chance to win. I think just going down there, it gave me that chance to work on things. It gave me the chance to better my game and just be a better goalie. I think just going down there and being with them and winning some games, it was good.”
NOTE: New acquisitions Luke Schenn and Tommy Novak ( full trade details here ) were not at today’s skate, Pittsburgh's last practice before the trade deadline hits on Friday at 3 PM Eastern, but Mike Sullivan provided some insight into what they could bring to the group.

Sullivan speaks to the media.
Sullivan said he’s heard so many great things about Schenn, a two-time Stanley Cup champion with Tampa Bay who’s skated in 1,057 NHL games, when it comes to his character and the type of teammate he is. Particularly from Dubas, who was Toronto’s GM during Schenn’s second stint with the Maple Leafs. Both Sullivan and Dubas see Schenn as someone who can help
“I think he commands a lot of respect around the league for the body of work that he's put together in this league,” Sullivan said. “We think he's a guy that's going to bring a certain dimension to our blue line. He's going to bring a hardness, a level of physicality. He's going to make us harder at the netfront, his shot-blocking capabilities should make our penalty kill better.
“I think his character and his leadership with some of the young people that we have in our organization on the blue line or otherwise, his influence there, it will be difficult to quantify. Those are the types of guys that are important when you're trying to reshape this team, and you've got an infusion of young players.”
As for Novak, Sullivan said he anticipates the 27-year-old lining up at center.
“We're excited about getting to know his game a little bit more closely. But obviously, our Hockey Operations group is really excited about this guy,” Sullivan said. “He's a younger player. He has good size. He's had a couple of pretty good years in Nashville. Maybe a little bit of a down year this year, but prior to that, he's played pretty well. So, he's a guy that we're going to explore where we think he might best fit.”
