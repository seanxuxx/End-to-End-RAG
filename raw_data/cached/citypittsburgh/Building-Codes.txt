In This Section
Construction in Pennsylvania, including the City of Pittsburgh, is regulated by the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act or PA Act No. 45 of 1999 , which is also commonly referred to as the Uniform Construction Code (UCC). The UCC adopts, in whole or part, the International Code Council’s (ICC) I-Codes.

The 2018 Base and 2018 Accessibility Codes are currently adopted under the PCCA/UCC. For more information please see PLI's 2015 Code Deadline and 2018 Code Adoption (PDF, 525KB) .

The City of Pittsburgh's adoption and amendment of the UCC is documented under Section 1002 of the Pittsburgh City Code . These local amendments remain applicable as the UCC is updated by the Commonwealth. While the City Ordinances reference specific 2003 I-code code sections, these amendments are enforced by PLI based on the code provision and/or topic.

Please note that PLI does not enforce the plumbing code provisions of the UCC. Please see Allegheny County Health Department’s Plumbing Program for plumbing code permits and regulations.
