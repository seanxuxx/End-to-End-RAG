The City of Pittsburgh owns 143 active bridges that span and climb our uneven terrain of rivers, runs, and valleys. These structures safely and efficiently connect 90 distinct neighborhoods into one unified community that we live, work, and play in. Their unrivaled scale, variety, and history are recognized worldwide and have proudly earned us our status as “The City of Bridges.”
Our bridges link us back to our industrial heritage while enabling transportation for millions of people and goods traveling today. Whether they cross a secluded park trail or the banks of the Monongahela River, each has a unique design and purpose. The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is responsible for city bridge improvement and maintenance and works to ensure that all of our assets continue to support the mobility needs of Pittsburgh well into the future.
Visit our City Bridge Dashboard to learn more about each bridge, including information and links to upcoming projects:
