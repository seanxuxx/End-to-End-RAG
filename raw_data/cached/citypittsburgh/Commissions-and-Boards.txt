The Department of City Planning (DCP) facilitates a number of Boards, Commissions, Panels, and Development Activities Meetings (DAMs) which review zoning variances and elements of development, design, public art, and historic preservation.
For additional information on a Board, Commission, or Panel, such as appointed members or past meeting minutes, please choose from the above table of contents or navigate through sections at the bottom of this page.
CDAP meets every other Tuesday, alternating with Planning Commission
The Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP) is comprised of eight members with expertise in the physical development of the City. The panel's mission is to promote quality of life in the City of Pittsburgh. CDAP achieves its mission through professional, voluntary design assistance to maximize the economic, civic, contextual, and aesthetic value of new development projects impacting the public realm. To fulfill this mission, CDAP advises the Department of City Planning by reviewing and providing design guidance on selected, higher profile projects throughout the City.
CDAP is an advisory panel, not a commission. Together with staff design review, the panel works to resolve design issues through professional peer critique before a Commission conducts its review. This frees the the Commission to focus on its responsibility of assuring that new developments are consistent with the overall planning objectives of the City. Some examples of these core considerations are:
Contextual Design Advisory Panel Members
Design review is a collaborative process between City Planning and project's design team. Staff Design Review is the initial design review phase using information submitted by the applicant. City Planning staff develop a set of Urban Design Targets, which are tailored to the development proposal, the unique site conditions, and the neighborhood and context of the development. Staff work with the applicant to address the Urban Design Targets and to satisfy design-related zoning requirements.
During the initial Staff Design Review phase, City Planning staff will recommend projects for review by CDAP. CDAP review is voluntary, but highly recommended for some projects. The applicant will update the design to address the Urban Design Targets and incorporate the staff’s comments, in preparation for the CDAP meeting. At the meeting, the project representative presents and discusses the project, surrounding context, and design concepts. CDAP members ask questions and make recommendations to the project representative.
Projects that CDAP may review range from building additions to multi-parcel developments. Staff evaluates each project and its surrounding context and determines whether CDAP review would be beneficial. This determination will be made early in the review process. The criteria considered include the size of the project, complexity of the design context, and impact on the public realm. Generally, CDAP reviews:
The most common format used for CDAP meetings follows the below outline. City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals.
After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines.
In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting.
In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance. CDAP can help the project representative meet their objectives while helping to create successful urban spaces.

The Historic Review Commission meets on the first Wednesday of each month. Meetings starts at 1:00 PM.
The Historic Review Commission (HRC) provides guidance to those seeking to conduct exterior work on historic buildings in the city.

The membership of the commission must include an architect, a preservationist, a realtor, a building inspector, and a planner.
The Historic Review Commission has control over any proposed new construction or demolition within a historic district and exterior work to a historic landmark. The review process begins when an owner decides to work to the building. To start an application, visit City Planning's Historic Preservation page.

Public Art Committee
Civic Design Committee
Over-The-Counter (OTC) review is conducted by staff for low-impact projects that meet certain eligibility criteria. Reviews are limited to proposed projects that will have a relatively minimal impact on the public realm. Projects may be eligible for Over-The-Counter approval based on the following criteria:
Replacements: Projects which replace the form or content of existing elements or fixtures in order to repair, improve, or update existing implementations. Replacements may be either of the following:
In Kind: Repair or replacement of existing elements or fixtures with identical products, or products of a similar aesthetic that have been slightly modified due to changes in cost, product availability, or updates.
Content: Changes made to written content or images in order to provide updated information, branding, or imagery which maintain the same overall aesthetic.
Negligible Changes: Projects that will have minimal to no impact on the public realm. Negligible changes may be either of the following:
Low Visibility: Changes or additions that cannot be easily viewed from public property or the right-of-way.
Minor change: Changes or additions that will not affect the general aesthetic of the site, would go unnoticed by a large portion of visitors to the site, or would be assumed by most viewers to be a standard element of City infrastructure.
City Standards: Projects that fit within the City’s established design standards.
Modifications: Changes to the design and/or aesthetic of projects that have previously been approved by the Public Art & Civic Design Commission.
To learn more, please download the OTC Process Guide via the link at the bottom of this section.
