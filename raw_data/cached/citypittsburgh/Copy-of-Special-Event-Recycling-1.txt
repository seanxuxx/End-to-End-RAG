You can either:
One of the biggest challenges facing recycling right now is contamination by wishful recycling or “wish-cycling”. This happens when non-recyclable objects are placed in the recycling bin with the wish it will be recycled. Additionally, recycling contamination occurs when food residue, liquids, and unacceptable materials (such as batteries, sharps, extra plastic bags, food waste, and greasy pizza boxes), are placed into the recycling can. Contaminants not only degrade the materials, boosting costs, but they can potentially cause harm to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and city employees.

The City of Pittsburgh’s Recycling Division is available to assist you in recycling at your event.
Assistance provided may include:
Event organizers must organize volunteers or provide staff for the collection, maintenance, and supervision of collection containers during your event.
In an effort to drive positive outcomes in special event recycling, the City operates under a model of cost recovery to recoup the costs of providing equipment directly to your event.
Please see the Public Works Rate Card (PDF, 164KB) to see our current pricing information. We are also willing to waive fees for events/organizers willing to self-service equipment from our office.
