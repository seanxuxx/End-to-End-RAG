ReelAbilities Pittsburgh is a national program presented locally by Film Pittsburgh. The original ReelAbilities Film Festival was initiated in New York at the JCC Manhattan in 2007. The festival was the first of its kind to present a series of award-winning films by, about, and for people with disabilities. In 2012, other cities across the US and around the world followed in New York’s footsteps and ReelAbilities events are currently held in more than 20 cities around the world.

The Special Olympics experience fills a critical need in the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by providing opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, and the demonstration of competence to themselves, their families and the community.  Athletes learn developmental and life skills as the benefits of participation translate beyond sports, helping them to live more independent and rewarding lives. Special Olympics also provides a positive venue for families, volunteers, and donors to become part of a caring community, and to become involved in the movement.
