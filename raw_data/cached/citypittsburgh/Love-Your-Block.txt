Love Your Block is a City of Pittsburgh program that brings neighbors together to improve our communities by combating blight, creating assets, and building resilience, block by block.
Nonprofit organizations across Pittsburgh are invited to propose projects for up to $2,500 in funds. Funding supports volunteer-fueled neighborhood improvement projects.

Wondering about examples of successful projects from previous Love Your Block years?
Read on to learn more about Feed the Hood, Knoxville’s Positivity Garden, and South Side Slopes Mission and Barry Streets Beautification.
Feed the Hood was the first project under the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh’s Farm-A-Lot program. The URA and community partners organized to regenerate vacant green space into a place of healing and positive interaction in Homewood North.
Using food and community engagement as the catalyst for this project, the Homewood Parklet was revitalized into an Orchard Park to help meet our mission to build positive relationships between people and food. Maintained green space also reduce violent crimes in high poverty areas.
The Knoxville Community Council applied to maintain the Positivity Garden on Zara Street that was created by neighbors on Zara Street. In addition to making improvements to the garden, the Council wanted to expand its impact by doing neighborhood clean ups with a focus on picking up litter and removing overgrowth throughout the neighborhood.
Grantees have said that without this funding, they would have had to close this garden as they simply couldn't do it without the grant’s help.
In the South Side Slopes, the application proposed a beautification project at the intersection of Mission and Barry Streets at the bottom of the Mission Street public staircase . The main focus was to organize general cleanup, cut back and remove of weeds and overgrowth, focusing on the corner and public staircase along both sides of steps at that location.
