The Office of Equal Protection Advocates for the Public by Enforcing Workers’ Rights, Civil Rights, and Public Safety Laws in Pittsburgh
The Office of Equal Protection is a civil enforcement and compliance office that seeks accountability in workers’ rights, civil rights, and public safety. The City of Pittsburgh and federal government have essential laws protecting the public health and welfare of Pittsburghers, including the Paid Sick Days Act, the Prevailing Wage ordinance, the Ensuring Equal Employment Opportunity for Persons Previously Convicted ordinance, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Disruptive Properties ordinance. These laws are designed to protect our communities, including the City’s most vulnerable citizens, from unfair labor practices, discrimination, and public nuisance. The Office of Equal Protection seeks to not only enforce these ordinances, but also educate Pittsburghers about their rights under law.
In the event you would like to file a complaint or report a violation related to paid sick leave, prevailing wage, or disruptive properties, please consult the following:
