The Oliver Bath House remains closed. Major renovations are scheduled to begin in Spring 2023. Re-opening is anticipated for Spring 2025.
The Oliver Bath House is an indoor facility open during the fall, winter and spring seasons for aquatic recreation. Make a splash by joining a water aerobics class, enjoying a family swim session — or Learn to Swim.
Note : Any child under the age of 6 must be accompanied by an adult (16 years or older) in the pool.
Programs include water aerobics and swimming lessons for infants, preschoolers, children and adults. Scheduled sessions will include open swim, family swim, adult swim and health & fitness swim.
Season passes purchased during the summer for admission to Citiparks outdoor pools will be honored at the Oliver Bath House. Individuals can buy pool tags at the indoor pool during regular operating hours.
