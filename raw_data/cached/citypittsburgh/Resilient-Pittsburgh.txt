Air quality issues. Inequality. Public health challenges. Flash floods. Infrastructure failure. Extreme weather.
There are just a few of the chronic stressors and acute shocks that challenge and threaten Pittsburgh. Though Pittsburgh has made significant progress in improving environmental stewardship and transitioning from a city in decline to a thriving hub of innovation, technology, education and medicine, we recognize there is still a need for focused, inclusive efforts to ensure all Pittsburgh residents and visitors live well and succeed.
In 2014, the City of Pittsburgh joined the 100 Resilient Cities Network, powered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and with the support of the RAND Corporation, has since engaged with more than 2,000 Pittsburghers to understand the City's resilience challenges and develop analyses, reports and actions to address them.

The City of Pittsburgh began the Pittsburgh Equity Indicators project in 2017 to assess annual progress toward equitable opportunities and outcomes for Pittsburghers of all races, genders and incomes, and to inform the City's investment decisions. Support by funding and guidance from the City University of New York Institute for State and Local Governance, the research team led by the RAND Corporation developed a framework and associated indicators to measure equality in both outcomes and opportunities in Pittsburgh.
The City of Pittsburgh received technical support and resources from a variety of organizations and companies to strengthen particular areas of concern including stormwater management, cybersecurity, mobility, air quality, waste and energy production.
These partnerships include:
