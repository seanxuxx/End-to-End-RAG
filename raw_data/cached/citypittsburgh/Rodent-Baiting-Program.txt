Did you know the City of Pittsburgh has its own Rodent Baiting Program that residents can utilize for free up to two times per year?
Residents must call "311" and request rodent bait, provide their name, phone number, and address.
A contractor will place one pet-safe baiting station on your property, good for about 200 rats or mice. The contractor will not usually make contact with you and will try to place the station discreetly unless a specific location is requested. The rodents will find the station from other areas of the property. After approximately one month, the contractor will return and check the station, replacing the bait if needed. After about two months, the station will be removed.
Only the owner or resident of a property can make the request for their home. The contractor cannot place stations on abandoned properties, empty lots or public ways. The program does not cover apartment buildings with more than four units or businesses. More severe issues at residential properties may have to be addressed privately. Issues creating or aggravating the problem, such as trash violations or poor property maintenance, should be reported to PLI through 311 for inspection.
The contractor does their best to fulfill requests in a timely manner, but due to the irregularity of the volume of requests and depending on the time of year, there may be a delay of up to several weeks in placing the station initially.
