In This Section
The City of Pittsburgh Spay & Neuter program for community cats will resume accepting applications for up to five cats per household as a temporary extension of the 2023 contract. This application and its requirements will remain in effect until a new contract is executed for this program within the next few months. At that time, we will have new, separate online forms for both community cats and pets with revised criteria. Until then, the Spay Neuter Program for pets is still paused and we ask you to check back with this webpage for further updates.
The City of Pittsburgh and the Bureau of Animal Care and Control is committed to assisting those resident pet owners most in need with the cost of altering their animals as well as ensuring that the community cat population is kept under control. The revamped criteria under discussion are in keeping with these goals. If you wish to have community cats altered, please download and fill out the below application and indicate where within City of Pittsburgh limits they were contained. You may email the application and supporting required documents to SpayNeuter@pittsburghpa.gov or mail to:
SpayNeuter@pittsburghpa.gov: mailto:SpayNeuter@pittsburghpa.gov
