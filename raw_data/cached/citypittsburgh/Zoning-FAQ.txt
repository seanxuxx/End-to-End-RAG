Most building permits, which are issued by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections, require zoning approval , also known as the Record of Zoning Approval or ROZA, including those for interior renovations when changing the use of the structure. However, only some will require a site plan (new parking, additions, HVAC, etc.). See Site Plan Requirements for details.
Please note: This document only covers work not requiring a Building Permit and/or a ROZA. A Certificate of Appropriateness may still be required for work on locally designated historic structures or structures in locally designated historic districts.

Not necessarily. Even when the district allows a two-family dwelling, all applicable code requirements must be met in order for that use to be approved for a specific location. These requirements include side yard setbacks, lot area, and parking requirements. Please consult with Zoning staff.
Make sure the intention is to change the zoning district of a property rather than simply wanting to change the use of the property (more common). If the intent is to change the use of the property, please consult zoning staff for the appropriate process.
In most cases, rezoning land is done at a larger scale with multiple parcels rather than a single property or for a single development. There are a few exceptions, and if you are interested in filing for a rezoning application, please file a pre-application request.
A property certification is required whenever there is a real estate closing on a property due to a sale or refinance. (Note: this is the same thing that used to be called the zoning certificate.) It is a document intended for the benefit of a buyer or lender to let them know the zoning district of the property, the legality of use, if there is an occupancy permit on file, if the property is in a local historic district, and if there are any active code violations on file.
Property line issues are not handled by the City. You should contact a magistrate or an attorney.
A home occupation can typically be approved through Basic Zoning Review . The Zoning Code criteria for review of home occupation is listed in 912.05 .

See the Consolidations/Subdivisions page for information about this process and appropriate contacts.
The Zoning Code is available on the Municode website . Select Title Nine for the Zoning Code.

Beginning October 3, 2022, new Zoning (ZDR) and PLI applications with work occurring in the floodplain will apply for a Floodplain Permit though the OneStopPGH portal. This permit type will replace the floodplain review currently housed in Zoning Development Review (ZDR). With this new formatting of the application, applicants will be able to apply for a single floodplain review for the entire construction project; check the boxes to identify all of your work.
Please see PLI's Floodplain Review Policy for in-depth information.
