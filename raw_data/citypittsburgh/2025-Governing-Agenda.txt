Mayor Gainey 2025 
Governing Agenda
For the past three years, Mayor Gainey has been rebuilding 
city government and putting it to work for everyone.
In 2025, the Gainey Administration is focused on a bold agenda

and preserve thousands more affordable homes, finish the

Complete our work to transform 
neighborhood safety 
Shootings and homicides had jumped 46% in the year before Mayor Gainey took office.
Only half of Pittsburgh residents felt their neighborhood was adequately policed.
Police struggled to respond to mental health and overdose crises – ⅓ of all calls.
Unsheltered unhoused people eclipsed sheltered unhoused people for the first time.
When Mayor Gainey stepped into office, he pledged to make Pittsburgh a city where no one lives in 
fear of crime or of the police, and where we maximize the use of public health and community-led 
safety strategies.
Our communities are safer
Homicides have fallen by 27%; if current trends hold, 2024 will have seen zero youth gun-related 
deaths in the Homewood neighborhood, thanks in part to the efforts of our REACH program. 
Our officers are more accountable
New police leadership and new police union contract with stronger discipline 
structure.

End chronic homelessness
•
House all estimated 250 people experiencing street homelessness 
•
With County, create a place for every person experiencing homelessness, ranging from 
temporary shelter to transitional housing to permanent supported housing to permanent 
subsidized housing to market housing — so that everyone can arrive in the spot that’s right 
for them  
•
Make services less costly — exploit Medicaid, state match mechanisms, County contracting, 
and other innovations to make housing supports more sustainable for taxpayers 
Make the City safer by letting police focus on violent actors and 
have social workers, technology, and unarmed personnel handle the 
rest
•
Expand the Reaching Out On The Streets (ROOTS) and Co-reponse citywide, programs and 
get police out of social work
•
Staff police station desks and office jobs with civilians and put officers in roles that can only 
be done by uniformed officers
•
Let smart technology handle parking traffic violations
Continue to dramatically reduce homicides and non-fatal shootings 
•
Fully deploy and resource community-led Comprehensive Violence Prevention Teams in every 
neighborhood to get to the root causes of violence  
Next we will…
Ongoing care for the most frequent users of 911 
Sustained, durable support to hundreds of vulnerable people per month with difficult-to-manage 
chronic health conditions; previously, these patients made many of the city’s 911 calls for help 
with falls, mobility challenges, and mental health issues. 
Mental health crisis response
Jump-started a program that was serving very few people; now serving hundreds of vulnerable 
people per month through through the Co-Response program.

Create and preserve thousands more 
affordable homes
In 2019, our city was short over 10,000 affordable homes to meet the needs of the lowest-income 
households. 
The number of Black homeowners in Pittsburgh dropped by over 700 between 2015 and 2019, while the 
number of homeowners from every other racial and ethnic group increased.
When Mayor Gainey stepped into office, he pledged to make Pittsburgh a city where everyone 
belongs and affordability is not a luxury.
It is quicker to build
By cutting steps in our permit process and making it so applicants only deal with one entity 
instead of three, we are making it faster and simpler to build.
We are using public land for public good
Between 2014-2021, the Land Bank moved zero properties. Under our stewardship, 
150 properties have moved or are in process, to be used for community purposes, 
affordable housing, and other public uses. 
We made government work…
Historic housing bond
We have nearly 2,000 new or preserved affordable units completed, under construction, or 
currently in process, and we launched an historic $32 million URA bond to support affordable 
housing; at least 1,000 units will be preserved and created within the first three years. 
We put government to work for everyone…
Create and preserve thousands more	
Create and preserve thousands more 
affordable homes
Over the next four years we will…
Cut our affordable housing deficit in half
•
Adopt a new residential zoning code that brings back housing types already found in 
neighborhoods across the city that rebuild dense, vibrant community
•
Spark signiﬁcant new construction of mid-density housing through the development and 
creation of shovel-ready designs
•
Create new limited equity co-op and social housing developments to provide more 
community- and publicly-owned housing options for residents and tap all the tools and 
resources of government to solve the housing crisis without having to rely exclusively on 
landlords and for-proﬁt developers 
•
Issue a second affordable housing bond to continue the historic levels of investment into the 
production and preservation of affordable housing across the city 
Reverse the loss of 700 Black homeowners over the last decade
•
Launch a second iteration of the OwnPGH program to build a new generation of 
homeowners  
•
Support community-led homeownership projects in neighborhoods facing development 
pressure to support working families with new units of quality affordable for-sale housing
Unlocking new housing in every neighborhood
Our changes to the zoning code will maximize the new homes that can be built in every single 
neighborhood of Pittsburgh. 
Create and preserve thousands more	
Finish strengthening our infrastructure
Between 2010-2020, we lost 200 Pittsburghers to traffic violence; 55 were walking, six were riding a 
bicycle.
The Fern Hollow Bridge collapsed on January 28, 2022, one example of the aging infrastructure we 
inherited.
In 2021, 100% of total energy for City facilities came from fossil fuels.
When Mayor Gainey stepped into office, he pledged to make Pittsburgh a city that prioritizes 
environmental health, traffic safety, and accessibility.
Safeguarding our bridges
Implemented a faster, smarter approach to repair our bridges; we have since spent $2M+ to 
improve the bridges at greatest risk, with 18 planned/ongoing bridge repair and replacement 
projects. 
Making neighborhood streets safer
Have increased the funding for traffic calming projects by 146% and prioritized areas of highest 
need, improving the safety of our neighborhood streets by slowing down traffic and enhancing the 
pedestrian and cycling experience.
We made government work…
We put government to work for everyone…
Building the city of the future
Creating first-ever comprehensive plan, which will set us on a course to make the Pittsburgh of 
2050 a more environmentally just, inclusive, and resilient city.

governments and communities 

Continue to support a welcoming, growing 
Pittsburgh
Despite our vibrant, proud cultures, our population has been declining, challenging our economic health.
When Mayor Gainey stepped into office, he pledged to make Pittsburgh a city that invests in its 
young people and welcomes new residents and those who have left back.
Brought the City to the neighborhoods

requests from these communities by 46% while still maintaining our completion rates. 
We made government work…

Build a more equitable city
In 2019, a Black resident moving from Pittsburgh to just about any other city in the U.S. would see their life 
expectancy, income, children’s educational opportunities, and employment improve.
When Mayor Gainey stepped into office, he pledged to make Pittsburgh a city that makes 
opportunity abundant for all.
Unrigging rules so inclusion is the norm
In our first year, we increased MBE participation by 35%, selected our first-ever LGBTQIA+ 
certified vendor on a City contract, and stewarded a 3000% increase in MWDBE utilization in our 
City’s Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund.
We made government work…
City leadership looks like the communities we serve
We have made our Boards and Commissions more diverse - getting younger; more Black, 
Hispanic, and more mixed-race; as well as increasing representation of women. Through 
strategies to build equitable talent our hiring trends have either matched the demographic makeup 
of our City or been more diverse.
