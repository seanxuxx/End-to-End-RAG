On behalf of the men and women who are members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, welcome to the website of one of the safest cities in America.
In 1873, the Police Badge was designed and officially adopted by the City of Pittsburgh. The badge is a unique design: The crest is from the Coat-of-Arms of William Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, and the man for whom Pittsburgh is named.
The policies have been put in place to ensure ethical and professional conduct on the part of the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police; to ensure equitable and constitutional enforcement of law; and to ensure that all members are dedicated to the principles of Procedural Justice.
The Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, Inc., County of Allegheny, is a nonprofit organization.
