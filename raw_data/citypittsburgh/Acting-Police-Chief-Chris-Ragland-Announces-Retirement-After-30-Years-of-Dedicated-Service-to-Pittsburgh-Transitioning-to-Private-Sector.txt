Acting Police Chief Chris Ragland Announces Retirement After 30 Years of Dedicated Service to Pittsburgh, Transitioning to Private Sector
"Today, Acting Police Chief Christopher (Chris) Ragland announced his retirement from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police after an outstanding 30-year career dedicated to law enforcement and service of our community. His decision follows his recent nomination to serve as Chief of Police. After much thought, Acting Chief Ragland has chosen to withdraw from consideration as permanent Chief of Police and step into a new chapter of his life, transitioning into the private sector with a national firm.
I receive the Chief’s news with regret. I felt he was the right man for the job and brought integrity and courage to a difficult position. I also respect his reasons for making his choice, and I believe it was a difficult decision for an officer who has given so much to our city.
I want to thank Assistant Chief Martin Devine who will step in as Acting Police Chief, continuing the strong leadership and direction established by Acting Chief Ragland. Devine has been with the bureau since May 2000 and was promoted in 2024, he is well-equipped to guide the department during this time of change.
As we navigate this transition, my administration remains committed to ensuring continuity and stability within the Bureau. We will work with Council and the community to create a process for selecting the city’s next Chief of Police.
While Chief Ragland’s departure is a loss for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, I remain incredibly confident in the strength of our department's leadership. The solid foundation built by Acting Chief Ragland and his team ensures that we are well-positioned for a smooth transition and that the next leader will continue to serve our city with the same dedication and commitment that has long defined our police force. I will not submit a nomination to City Council until I am certain that we have found the right individual and the right confirmation process.
I extend my deepest gratitude to Acting Chief Chris Ragland for his exemplary service and wish him all the best as he embarks on this exciting new chapter in his career. His contributions to our city will not be forgotten, and his legacy will continue to inspire those who follow in his footsteps.”~ Mayor Ed Gainey
