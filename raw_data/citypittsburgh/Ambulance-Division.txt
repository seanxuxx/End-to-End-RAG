In This Section
The Ambulance Division is comprised of 13 Medic Units and 2 BLS Ambulances receiving calls from the 911 dispatch center 24 hours/day. The Division is overseen by a minimum of two District Chiefs during normal daily operations.
Medic Units are spread across Pittsburgh better allowing for the most effective and efficient response. Also, in coordination with the Center for Emergency Medicine, a Physician is able to respond to the scene at the request of our Paramedics to assist with the treatment of particularly critical patients.
In addition to emergency treatment and transport of patients, the Ambulance Division provides medical coverage for special events throughout the City of Pittsburgh.
