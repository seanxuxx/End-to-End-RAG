Dogs are not allowed to run loose in the City of Pittsburgh. We like to help ensure the safety of people in the community as well as trying to reunite the dog with its owner. To report the loose dog, please call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday between the hours of 7am and 3pm. Outside of these hours, please call 412-255-2935. If you feel you are in imminent danger from the dog, it is appropriate to call 911 at any time.
There is no law against cats roaming free in the City of Pittsburgh, but they are required to have a collar with identification. If you have found a friendly cat without identification, animal control officers will pick it up if it is contained in some way (carrier, cage, humane trap). Animal Care and Control is not able to respond to calls regarding loose cats that are not contained. We are able to provide a humane trap for residents needing to capture a cat on their property. Please contact the office at 412-255-2036, Monday through Friday from 7am to 3pm to discuss trapping.
Losing a pet can be a very stressful experience. Following these steps can help reunite you with your lost pet more quickly:
We're glad you asked! Cats with an ear that is "tipped" or notched (see photo) aren't really strays. They are feral cats. This means the cats are not tame, but they are cared for by someone in your neighborhood. A cat with a tipped ear has been spayed or neutered and vaccinated against rabies. These cats help to keep rodent populations in check. They are no danger to residents, but should not be approached, as they are essentially wild. For more information on feral cats, please check out www.alleycat.org or call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday, 7am to 3pm.

We're glad you're concerned about the anima's well-being, because we are too! You can call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 to discuss your concerns. You may remain anonymous if you wish. Concerns about animal neglect or cruelty may also be reported to the Humane Officers at The Humane Animal Rescue at 412-345-7300 or Animal Friends at 412- 847-7000.
It's possible that your neighbor doesn't know his/her dog barks all the time. If you know your neighbor, you can try talking with him/her about the problem. If you aren't comfortable talking with your neighbor, feel free to call the office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday, 7am to 3pm, and we can help to resolve the problem. Please have the address of the property where the dog lives available when you call.
No problem, just give us a call at 412-255-2036, Monday through Friday from 7am to 3pm, for any other questions or concerns. Please note, this is for general questions or concerns only. Any requests for services or concerns about an animal's welfare should be submitted directly to the office via phone.
