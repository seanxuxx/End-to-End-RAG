Black History Month 2025 celebrates the National Negro Opera Company (NNOC), founded in 1941 in Pittsburgh as the first African American opera company in the United States. Mary Cardwell Dawson established the company with the goal of promoting African American performers in the opera world, which was predominantly white at the time. The NNOC was instrumental in breaking racial barriers within the classical music world, offering a platform for Black opera singers to showcase their talents and gain recognition for more than two decades.
