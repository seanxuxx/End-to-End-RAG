The City of Pittsburgh's adoption and amendment of the UCC is documented underSection 1002 of the Pittsburgh City Code. These local amendments remain applicable as the UCC is updated by the Commonwealth. While the City Ordinances reference specific 2003 I-code code sections, these amendments are enforced by PLI based on the code provision and/or topic.
