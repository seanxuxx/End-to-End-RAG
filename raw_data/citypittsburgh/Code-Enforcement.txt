One purpose of the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections Code Enforcement is to protect the health, safety, and welfare in existing buildings and structures. PLI enforces the International Property Maintenance Code ("IPMC") as adopted by theCity of Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances Title 10 Chapter 1004. PLI also enforces theZoning Code – Title Nine.

Most inspections start with requests that are called, texted, tweeted or electronically submitted to the 311 Response Center. The requests are anonymous, and each request prompts an inspection.
Once an inspector gets a request, the inspector follows a standardized process that was created to make sure that property owners get a legal Request for Compliance and a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue.
If you get a Request for Compliance and want to talk to the inspector, please call their direct number, which is on the request. Here is an example of a Request for Compliance:
If you must leave a voicemail, the inspector will make every effort to call you back as quickly as possible. Please give them a day to respond. When you talk to the inspector, you can talk about the request, try to work out the issue, and/or schedule an appointment or follow-up inspection.
If you do not respond to the Request for Compliance and do not fix the violation, the inspector will do a second inspection and send a second request. Again, you can still call the inspector, try to work things out, and fix the violation.
If the issue is not fixed by the deadline in the second request, the inspector does a third and final inspection. If the inspector finds the same violation, you will receive a third notice, and a criminal court complaint will be filed with the local magisterial district judge. Once the judge receives the complaint, the judge will schedule a hearing and serve the hearing documents on the property owner of record. If you are found guilty at the hearing, the judge can impose a fine. If you do not pay the fine, the judge can find you in contempt and send you to jail. To hopefully avoid all of those things, even though it is ultimately up to the judge to decide what to do once a complaint has been filed, PLI encourages you to work with your inspector and fix the violations.
