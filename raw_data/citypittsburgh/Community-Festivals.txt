Enjoy the diverse heritage, food and entertainment of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods. Throughout the year, community festivals celebrate city living and showcase the best features of our thriving neighborhoods.
In existence since 1977, the Community Festival Program Grant has provided funding to help communities introduce and maintain neighborhood-focused festivals for over 40 years.

The festival season is from June 1 to October 31.
To be eligible for funding, your organization and event must meet all of the following criteria:
