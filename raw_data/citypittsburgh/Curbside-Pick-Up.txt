The mission of Environmental Services is to establish and maintain a refuse and recycling system that promotes a safe, litter-free and environmentally friendly City for all of its residents and customers.
The City of Pittsburgh provides a range of pick-up ofrefuse waste(Show info)and recycling services. Choose which best suits your need here:
refuse waste(Show info): https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Glossary/Refuse
Each week Environmental Services provides curbside pick up of common refuse.
All residents of single-family homes and small apartments (five or fewer) must separate recyclable items from household trash and package them for bi-weekly recycling curbside collection.
The City of Pittsburgh has recently wrapped a program to distribute 100,000+ blue recycling bins to residents and become bag free curbside by 2023.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, refuse/recycling collection is one of the most dangerous jobs in America. Look out for our workers and your neighbors.
If the waste that you properly set out was not picked up by Environmental Services, you can alert us and we will correct our mistake by sending out a truck for additional pick up!
