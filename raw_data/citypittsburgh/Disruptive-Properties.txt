In This Section
The Mayor’s Office of Equal Protection enforces and ensures compliance with Chapter 670 of the City Code, the Disruptive Properties ordinance. Disruptive commercial properties threaten the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Pittsburgh and burden its public safety services. When owners repeatedly violate the law by permitting illegal activities onsite or failing to properly maintain their commercial properties, the City may take action against them.
Such action is reserved for repeated, unabated offenses. A commercial property may be designated as Disruptive pursuant to Chapter 670only aftera single felony violation or at least three citations for disruptive activity.Neighbors disturbed by properties in disrepair are advised to contact theCity’s 3-1-1 Response Centerto initiate a complaint.
Designation as a Disruptive Property has serious consequences. The Public Safety Director is authorized to charge the property owner for all costs of law enforcement or public services called to a Disruptive Property. When a property violation remains unabated for an unreasonably long period of time, misdemeanor charges may also result.
