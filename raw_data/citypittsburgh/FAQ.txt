Yes. Participants in PGH Lab will be paid $25,000 in 6 installments over the course of the program.
Any equipment used will not be retained or considered property of the City of Pittsburgh or participating authorities. All products tested as part of PGH Lab will be returned at the end of the pilot.
Companies with paid pilots or paying customers are eligible to apply.
Yes, if you have an innovative service that presents great potential to improve city operations and help the City of Pittsburgh deliver quality services, tell us how your service works. Refer to FlyWheel and Global Wordsmiths pilot projects for inspiration.

The goal for both startups and the City is to have successfully completed pilots with measurable outcomes. To that end, a startup must have time, staff, equipment, and other required resources to sustain and complete a pilot for up to 6 months. In addition, the startup is required to allocate time for bi-weekly check-in meetings with program manager, meetings with city champions, and a company presentation day. Please check the PGH Lab Rules & Regulations Booklet for detailed information on company expectations.

PGH Lab’s OpenGov solicitation should only be used for submittals by organizations interested in participating in the PGH Lab program. This is not a venue to sell the City of Pittsburgh products or services, initiate a procurement agreement, become an approved vendor, or respond to an RFP outside of the PGH Lab program. Please refer to Beacon and City Procurement Procedures for these actions.
PGH Lab defines “startup” according to the phase a pilot product is in rather than the age or size of the company. If you have products or services with revenue streams but have a pilot-ready product that is pre-customer, you should still apply. The pilot would only test that beta phase product.
Participants in the PGH Lab program will receive public attention from local news outlets. However, the PGH Lab program is not the portal for requesting a formal letter of support from the Mayor.
The city will provide a dedicated program liaison, access to any equipment, infrastructure, or staff required to successfully execute the pilot. In addition, participants will be paid $25,000 in 6 installments over the course of the program.
Startups have an opportunity to test their product. This test case is valuable in seeking investors and customers. Startups will also be connected to a range of city resources. Startups are encouraged to test, gain valuable market feedback, and iterate. Each participating company will receive a stipend totaling $25,000 that will be distributed in parts over the course of the six month PGH Lab pilot.
