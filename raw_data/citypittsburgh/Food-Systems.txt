In a city where more than 1 in 5 residents face food insecurity—more than twice the national average—there is a critical need for the City of Pittsburgh to intervene through leadership and collaboration. Tackling this issue will require input from a variety of actors, such as the City, nonprofits, city agents, but most importantly, the local Pittsburgh community.
Local food is a crucial component in confronting the issue of food insecurity. Local food is defined as food that was grown or produced within a certain radius of where it is consumed. Local food movements aim to connect food producers and consumers in the same geographic region to develop more self-reliant and resilient food networks. Local food is fresher, lasts longer, and tastes better than food that has traveled hundreds of miles. Buying local food also has huge positive effects on the environment – by buying food that has traveled fewer miles and that was grown without pesticides and high gas emission practices, our food can help us live in a more sustainable way.
