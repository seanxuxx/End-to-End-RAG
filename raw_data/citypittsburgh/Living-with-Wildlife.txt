Sometimes an animal has already entered your home or is causing damage to your property. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that exhibits unusual behavior that may indicate a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. If there is an animal inside your home, please call the office directly for immediate assistance.
It’s important to remember that live trapping wild animals only temporarily solves a problem. Many studies have shown that live trapping wild animals actually creates a vacuum that allows more animals to move into that now open area . Also, less competition for food among wild animals means that more offspring will be born each year.
There are many cities as large or larger than Pittsburgh with about the same wild animal population that do not allow their residents to live trap any wild animals. These city residents have learned how to live with the wild animals in their respective cities.
