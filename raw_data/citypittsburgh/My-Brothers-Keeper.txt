Developing Strategic Plan
Late Night Basketball Initiative
My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) Pittsburgh under the leadership of Mayor Gainey is launching a late-night basketball program for young adults; ages 18-26 to provide them a safe place and safe activities. This initiative is designed to advanced Mayor Gainey’s violence prevention strategy to provide safe places for youth by providing constructive activities and connections to resources that are root causes to the violence taking place within this age group. Our goal is to take our most at-risk youth and place them on a pathway to prosperity to improve their personal and professional growth and take their shared learnings back to their families and neighborhoods. Initiatives like this play a crucial role in spearheading efforts for a safer city by addressing the underlying causes of violence and offering a constructive avenue through the universal language of sports, which has the power to bridge diverse backgrounds and bring communities together.
Through this initiative, participants will play in a 9-week basketball season that connects them to activities and resources that develops their personal and professional skills. Basketball and hot meals are the incentive to get participants involved, however, our keygoalsfor this initiative is to connect our participants to the supportive services provided at the games and open gyms.
