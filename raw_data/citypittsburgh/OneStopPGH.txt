You have heard the adage before: time is money. And until recently, contractors, architects, and developers, alike, had no option but to travel Downtown to submit paperwork, pay fees, and apply for permits.
In 2019, Mayor Peduto announced OneStopPGH : a website where residents can apply, pay for, and receive business licenses and permits, upload development plans, and track violation notices. Now you can navigate the development process from home, work, or on the go. Led by our team, this multi-year, multi-million dollar project has modernized the way the City of Pittsburgh conducts business.
Services provided by the Departments of City Planning, Mobility & Infrastructure, and Permits, Licenses, & Inspections are now online, with more services coming in the future. The impact is saving time for customers and increasing revenue for the City of Pittsburgh.
For information on the four phases, timeline, and other resources please visit the OneStopPGH information website .
