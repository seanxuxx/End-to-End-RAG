“We want to empower grassroots creativity in the many vibrant organizations working to strengthen our City’s food system. Food security is a major issue, and addressing it requires investing in community-led solutions that increase access to healthy, culturally relevant food at a neighborhood level,” said Gabbi McMorland (she/her), Food Justice Fund Program Coordinator. “Many thanks to the advocates, elected officials, and City staff who brought this program’s vision to life over the past few years.”
The City will evaluate all applications to ensure the eligible use of Federal ARPA funds. After that, eligible applications will be scored and recommended for City Council approval by the Food Justice Fund Governance Committee, a group of City residents with food systems expertise and strong connections to communities experiencing food insecurity.
The City has contracted with New Sun Rising to assist with award management services and fund distribution. The City has also contracted Paramount Pursuits to provide technical assistance available to all interested applicants during the application process.
Additionally, the City will host two virtual information sessions for prospective applicants.
