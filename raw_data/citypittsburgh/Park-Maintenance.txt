In This Section
The Department of Public Works is responsible for the daily maintenance and repair of Pittsburgh's park system. Around 100 laborers within our six Parks Divisions care for 163 public parks.
We work in cooperation with CitiParks, the Department of Public Works' Forestry Division, and the Department of City Planning on tree maintenance, major park and playground upgrades, master plans, and donor initiated projects. Pittsburgh's historic parks have a wide variety of amenities, monuments, fountains, courts, fields, and more.
Over a century after Director of Public Works Edward M. Bigelow became known as the "father of our parks" for his ambitions park acquisitions, the department works daily to ensure these assets remain a gem of our community for the next century.
Please submit all maintenance requests to the 311 Response Line .
