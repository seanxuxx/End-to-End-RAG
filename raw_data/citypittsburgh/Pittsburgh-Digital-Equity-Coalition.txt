In October of 2022 City of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald announced the Pittsburgh Digital Equity (Show info) Coalition (PDEC), a working group of anchor organizations already working to promote digital equity and smaller community groups with intimate knowledge of the community need.
Equity (Show info): https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Glossary/Equity
PDEC has identified four areas of greatest need for digital equity programming and defined equity outcomes for each goal. In their final report, due this summer, PDEC will provide specific recommendations to address each of the four areas.
According to the latest available release of American Community Survey data:
Local surveys, national surveys, and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that affordability is the biggest reason households do not subscribe to broadband, and a lack of understanding for how to use a computer is a major contributing factor. Additionally, a 2022 Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission report on Equitable Broadband Access indicates that Seniors, Families with K-12 students, and Black citizens are disproportionately disconnected, and efforts should be taken to help these key populations.
A coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions provided the Pittsburgh region with the opportunity to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come. This plan comprehensively addresses the gaps in digital skills, low-cost high-speed internet services, as well as access to devices and technical assistance.
