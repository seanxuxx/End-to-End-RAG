In This Section
Applications submitted to the Department of City Planning for review may require Zoning Review and/or one or more of the Planning reviews, public notices and/or public hearings listed below depending on the location and scope of work. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, but includes the most common components.
Zoning Review is the overarching review for most Zoning Development Review applications. There are three levels of Zoning Review: Basic Zoning Review, Site Plan Review, and Zoning Review with Planning Commission. The level of review applicable for any given project will depend on the location and scope of work for that project. Below is a general overview of the three levels of Zoning Review.
In some cases, the Zoning Review will be contingent upon the successful completion of one or more additional reviews, posted notices and/or public hearings administered or coordinated by the Department of City Planning. These additional components also depend on the location and scope of work.
In addition, if the project location does not have a valid address, final approval will not be issued until an Address Request application has been successfully completed and an Address Verification Letter has been issued.
Projects that successfully complete the Zoning Review Process typically receive at least one approval document called the Record of Zoning Approval (ROZA), but may also receive others such as the Certificate of Appropriateness, to submit to the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections along with any other required documentation in order to apply for the appropriate permits issued by that department.
All development review projects, including signs, require a Zoning and Development Review Application, which may be submitted through the OneStopPGH online portal. Most applications filed online require a filing fee, paid via credit card or e-check. (Please note a service charge will apply). Hard copy applications and checks may still be mailed or dropped off at the OneStopPGH Counter, 412 Boulevard of the Allies, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
