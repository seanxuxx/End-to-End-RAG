Climate Action Plan 3.0 lays out strategies through which Pittsburgh can reduce greenhouse gas emissions within city limits and within City operations. This will lessen Pittsburgh’s contribution to global climate change.
Why does Pittsburgh need resilience? Air quality issues. Inequality. Public health challenges. Flash floods. Infrastructure failure. Extreme weather. These are just a few of the chronic stressors and acute shocks that challenge and threaten Pittsburgh.
In a city where more than 1 in 5 residents face food insecurity—more than twice the national average—there is a critical need for the City of Pittsburgh to intervene through leadership and collaboration. Tackling this issue will require input from a variety of actors, such as the City, nonprofits, city agents, but most importantly, the local Pittsburgh community.
Access resources for residents, businesses, advocates, and researchers.
