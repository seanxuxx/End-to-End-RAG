The Mayor's Office of Equal Protection works to build a Pittsburgh that is safe and welcoming to all, and that provides opportunities for everyone— inclusive of our disabilities— to thrive. As part of our quest to increase access to all city events, services, facilities, programs, and infrastructure, we assist with accommodations, grievances, and resources. We seek to engage with people with disabilities and their allies to guide our policy and help us build a roadmap to a more inclusive Pittsburgh.
The City of Pittsburgh is developing an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Transition Plan to improve accessibility for people with disabilities.
