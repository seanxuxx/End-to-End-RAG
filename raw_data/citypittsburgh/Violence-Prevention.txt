Community organizations receiving 2024 STOP The Violence Community Investment Grants are located in each police zone. The City of Pittsburgh awarded nearly $1 million to forty-three organizations with an established history of addressing community needs, particularly those servicing high-risk individuals.
If you would like contact information on any of the grantees, please contact the STOP the Violence Office.
These grants are a component of the Pittsburgh Plan For Peace that will complement the existing work being done by the City's Group Violence Intervention Support and Outreach efforts, including the REACH team.
These violence prevention efforts are made possible by the City's STOP the Violence Trust Fund. The Trust Fund was created in 2020 partially in response to protests after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
