In This Section
Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities (BASC) is a three-year initiative to turbocharge 25 U.S. cities’ efforts to proactively build cleaner, more resilient, and economically thriving communities. The initiative aims to enhance the work already being done by climate-forward mayors across the U.S. by providing support for cities to design climate programs that fully seize the historic opportunity to access and implement federal funds to advance transformative changes.
Data shows that major sources of harmful pollution are disproportionately located in communities of Black people and people of color living on low incomes. Through Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities, i-teams will focus on building relationships in these communities and work alongside them to advance innovative projects that provide cleaner air, improved public health, a stronger economy with clean energy jobs, and the promise of a more equitable, sustainable future.
The Pittsburgh i-team is focused on two key City priorities: advancing initiatives to electrify, weatherize, and install solar systems in the homes of under-resourced residents, while simultaneously expanding workforce opportunities and creating clean energy career pathways for disadvantaged workers. These efforts also aim to support minority- and women-owned businesses in the region.
Dr. Daren A. Ellerbee, i-team Director, and Elliott Williams, i-team Civic Designer, will lead this work in Pittsburgh.
