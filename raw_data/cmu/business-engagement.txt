Since its founding by industrialist Andrew Carnegie, CMU has been where ideas become innovations, academia partners with industry, and problems find real-world solutions. You’d expect nothing less from the birthplace of AI, the university that reinvented business education, the leading pioneer in advanced manufacturing and the first degree-granting program in drama.
Here, the world’s best researchers, students and faculty engage in boundary breaking cross-disciplinary collaboration, both internally and externally, that bring new products to market, move industries forward, prepare workers for the challenges of tomorrow and create new fields of discovery. A connection to the CMU community has been the key advantage for many startups, tech firms, manufacturers, financial institutions and more.
