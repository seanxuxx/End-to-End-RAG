"What's Buggy?" you ask.
It is the quintessential interdisciplinary sport and it's one of Carnegie Mellon University's longest held traditions.
This annual student-led relay race, officially known as "Sweepstakes," partners designers, engineers, mechanics and athletes. Together, these brilliant, quirky, creative minds produce a buggy — an aerodynamic vehicle with no engine. It's powered by brains and brawn alone.
In just over two minutes, teams of power-pushing men and women race around a .84 mile track with buggy and driver leading the way around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill, with speeds up to 40 mph.
Every April during Spring Carnival, students, alumni and community fans watch Buggy teams compete for the annual title.

Paws to Relax: Weekly Pet Therapy Program
Volunteers through Animal Friend's Therapet program join us weekly on Wednesdays from 7-8 p.m. to offer some friendly dog companions for the hour. Take a break and join us!

Carnival
Every spring, Alpha Chi participates in one of Carnegie Mellon’s most well-known Spring Carnival traditions, booth! Our sisters build, craft and design a multi-story structure using power tools, paint, and passion. This is a great opportunity for every Alpha Chi to get trained in practical tool skills and translate their creativity into craft.
Our theme for our 2024 booth is Kirby, and we won third prize in Sorority booth!
