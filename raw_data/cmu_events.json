Settlement, industrialization, urbanization and redevelopment have each left a profound mark on the region\u2019s built environment. The architecture bears testimony to the forces that shaped it, but buildings can only tell part of the stories. The histories of their conception, design, and construction are contained in the drawings and other documents shared between clients, architects, and contractors. These architectural records document an irretrievable past (for buildings demolished or left unbuilt), facilitate the preservation and reuse of extant buildings, and inform our understanding of our surroundings. For the past 40 years, the Architecture Archives collections at Carnegie Mellon University have documented thousands of projects and the work of hundreds of designers. Records have been obtained from architects and their firms, families, property owners, and governments. This wide diversity of materials\u2014preliminary sketches, renderings, specifications, photographs, publications and architectural models\u2014helps piece together the rich history of Pittsburgh and the region.

She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace\u2019s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace\u2019s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife\u2019s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her \u201chappy.\u201d By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

This narrative rejects the historical misconception that Treblinka was an isolated Nazi extermination camp with few witnesses and fewer survivors. Rather than the secret, sanitized site of industrial killing Treblinka was intended to be, Jacob Flaws argues, Treblinka\u2019s mass murder was well known to the nearby townspeople who experienced the sights, sounds, smells, people, bodies and train cars the camp ejected into the surrounding world. Through spatial reality, Flaws portrays the conceptions, fantasies, ideological assumptions and memories of Treblinka from witnesses in the camp and surrounding towns. To do so he identifies six key spaces that once composed the historical site of Treblinka: the ideological space, the behavioral space, the space of life and death, the interactional space, the sensory space, and the extended space. By examining these spaces, Flaws reveals that there were more witnesses to Treblinka than previously realized, as the transnational groups near and within the camp overlapped and interacted. \u201cSpaces of Treblinka\u201d provides a staggering and profound reassessment of the relationship between knowing and not knowing and asks us to confront the timely warning that we, in our modern, interconnected world, can all become witnesses. The conversation will be moderated by Michal Rose Friedman, the Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies in the Department of History at CMU. Sponsored by CMU\u2019s Department of History and Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies, in partnership with Classrooms Without Borders, the University of Pittsburgh Jewish Studies Program and the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh.

She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace\u2019s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace\u2019s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife\u2019s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her \u201chappy.\u201d By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert\u2019s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts. Before long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator\u2014the \u201cworld\u2019s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot\u201d\u2014was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world\u2019s first university-wide computer network and file system. This growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country. By the decade\u2019s end, the university experience had transformed in ways few could have imagined. Learn more at https://library.cmu.edu/about/exhibits/cmu-1980s Add to my calendar"

We will share some common and not-so-common accommodations that may support a neurodivergent student in fully accessing their education, and how instructors and advisors can best support students in connecting students with our offices and implementing approved accommodations.

She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace\u2019s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace\u2019s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife\u2019s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her \u201chappy.\u201d By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

Join the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology (CMIST) as we welcome Dr. Laura DeNardis for a discussion on the growing challenges of space cybersecurity and governance. From navigation and financial platforms to national security, we increasingly rely on space. However, satellite congestion, space debris, and threats like energy weapons and anti-satellite missiles pose a significant risk. DeNardis will discuss the governance considerations needed as we work towards building a secure solar-system Internet, including the security implications of shifting stakeholders from nation-states to private entities. Laura DeNardis is professor and endowed chair in technology, ethics and society at Georgetown University. A scholar of cybersecurity and technology governance, DeNardis was listed as one of thirty-two Innovators Building a Better Future by Wired UK. Among her many books, The Internet in Everything: Freedom and Security in a World with No Off Switch was listed as a Financial Times Top Technology Book of 2020 and her book The Global War for Internet Governance is considered a definitive source for understanding conflicts in cyberspace. DeNardis is an affiliated fellow of the Yale Information Society Project, where she previously served as executive director. She served as the research director of the Global Commission on Internet Governance from 2014 to 2016. She holds an engineering science degree from Dartmouth, an MS in engineering from Cornell, a PhD in science and technology studies from Virginia Tech, and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship from Yale Law School.

She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace\u2019s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace\u2019s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife\u2019s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her \u201chappy.\u201d By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.
