Here to Stay: Celebrating 40 Years at the Architecture Archives. May 23 - June 1, 2025. All Day (until June 1) Hunt Library, Fourth Floor.
This University Libraries’ exhibition celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Architecture Archives, which was founded to create, conserve and promote the rich history of Pittsburgh’s buildings and tell part of the story of this dynamic city. Settlement, industrialization, urbanization and redevelopment have each left a profound mark on the region’s built environment. The architecture bears testimony to the forces that shaped it, but buildings can only tell part of the stories. The histories of their conception, design, and construction are contained in the drawings and other documents shared between clients, architects, and contractors. These architectural records document an irretrievable past (for buildings demolished or left unbuilt), facilitate the preservation and reuse of extant buildings, and inform our understanding of our surroundings. For the past 40 years, the Architecture Archives collections at Carnegie Mellon University have documented thousands of projects and the work of hundreds of designers. Records have been obtained from architects and their firms, families, property owners, and governments. This wide diversity of materials—preliminary sketches, renderings, specifications, photographs, publications and architectural models—helps piece together the rich history of Pittsburgh and the region.

CMU Drama Presents: Mary-Kate Olsen Is in Love. April 25, 2025. 4 p.m. John Wells Video Studio, Purnell Center for the Arts.
Pop culture, conformity and self-actualization Grace was supposed to have a certain kind of life. She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.” By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

Spaces of Treblinka: A Conversation With Author Dr. Jacob Flaws. March 20, 2025. 5 - 7 p.m. Baker Hall, A53 Steinberg Auditorium.
Historian and author Dr. Jacob Flaws will discuss his new book, “Spaces of Treblinka: Retracing a Death Camp.” “Spaces of Treblinka” utilizes testimonies, oral histories and recollections from Jewish, German and Polish witnesses to create a holistic representation of the Treblinka death camp during its operation. This narrative rejects the historical misconception that Treblinka was an isolated Nazi extermination camp with few witnesses and fewer survivors. Rather than the secret, sanitized site of industrial killing Treblinka was intended to be, Jacob Flaws argues, Treblinka’s mass murder was well known to the nearby townspeople who experienced the sights, sounds, smells, people, bodies and train cars the camp ejected into the surrounding world. Through spatial reality, Flaws portrays the conceptions, fantasies, ideological assumptions and memories of Treblinka from witnesses in the camp and surrounding towns. To do so he identifies six key spaces that once composed the historical site of Treblinka: the ideological space, the behavioral space, the space of life and death, the interactional space, the sensory space, and the extended space. By examining these spaces, Flaws reveals that there were more witnesses to Treblinka than previously realized, as the transnational groups near and within the camp overlapped and interacted. “Spaces of Treblinka” provides a staggering and profound reassessment of the relationship between knowing and not knowing and asks us to confront the timely warning that we, in our modern, interconnected world, can all become witnesses. The conversation will be moderated by Michal Rose Friedman, the Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies in the Department of History at CMU. Sponsored by CMU’s Department of History and Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies, in partnership with Classrooms Without Borders, the University of Pittsburgh Jewish Studies Program and the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh.

Libraries Workshop: Collaborating on GitHub. March 19, 2025. Noon - 1:30 p.m. Online.
In this workshop, we will introduce a basic workflow collaborating on GitHub, along with best practices and tips on how to collaborate more effectively.

The advantage of collaborating on GitHub is that it allows each collaborator to work on separate branches, communicate about changes, resolve conflict, while ensuring that all changes made to the project are tracked and resolved without irreversibly impacting the work of others. Prerequisites: Learners without basic knowledge on Git and version control are highly encouraged to attend the Committing to Git? No Code Introduction to Git prior to taking this workshop.

CMU Drama Presents: Mary-Kate Olsen Is in Love. April 23, 2025. 8 p.m. John Wells Video Studio, Purnell Center for the Arts.
Pop culture, conformity and self-actualization Grace was supposed to have a certain kind of life. She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.” By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

Like, Totally Transformative: CMU in the 1980s. Aug. 30 - July 11, 2025. All Day (until July 11) Hunt Library Gallery.
This University Libraries’ exhibit is a portal to the past, a snapshot of life on campus more than four decades ago as our world began to transform! Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert’s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts. Before long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator—the “world’s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot”—was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world’s first university-wide computer network and file system. This growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country. By the decade’s end, the university experience had transformed in ways few could have imagined. Learn more at https://library.cmu.edu/about/exhibits/cmu-1980s Add to my calendar.

This is the third workshop in the Neuroinclusive Teaching Series, a joint collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Some, though certainly not all, individuals who identify as neurodivergent experience disability. In this session, Leigh Culley from Pitt’s Disability Resources and Services and Catherine Getchell from CMU’s Office of Disability Resources discuss the reasons why someone who is neurodivergent might experience disability as a result. We will share some common and not-so-common accommodations that may support a neurodivergent student in fully accessing their education, and how instructors and advisors can best support students in connecting students with our offices and implementing approved accommodations. Hosted by the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation. Register here. The Zoom link will be sent to registered participants. Add to my calendar.

CMU Drama Presents: Mary-Kate Olsen Is in Love. April 25, 2025. 8 p.m. John Wells Video Studio, Purnell Center for the Arts.
Pop culture, conformity and self-actualization Grace was supposed to have a certain kind of life. She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life. However, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.” By Mallery Avidon Directed by Anya Hilpert Performances April 23-25 Tickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.

Laura DeNardis is professor and endowed chair in technology, ethics and society at Georgetown University. A scholar of cybersecurity and technology governance, DeNardis was listed as one of thirty-two Innovators Building a Better Future by Wired UK. Among her many books, The Internet in Everything: Freedom and Security in a World with No Off Switch was listed as a Financial Times Top Technology Book of 2020 and her book The Global War for Internet Governance is considered a definitive source for understanding conflicts in cyberspace. DeNardis is an affiliated fellow of the Yale Information Society Project, where she previously served as executive director. She served as the research director of the Global Commission on Internet Governance from 2014 to 2016.
