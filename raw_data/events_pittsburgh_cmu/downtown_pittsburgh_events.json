        "description": "The 2023 Tony-winner for best musical, based on David Lindsay-Abaire's play of the same title, revolves around a teenage girl named Kimberly Levaco, who suffers from a condition that rapidly accelerates the aging process. Before she has had a chance to venture forth into the world as an adult, she finds herself turning into an old woman. Her story, unfolding like a dark fairy tale, is as whimsical as it is piercing. Yet the effect is powerfully life-affirming in the way it reminds audiences of the preciousness of the time we have at hand. Full of quirky humor and social satire on grownup immaturity, the musical features a score by Jeanine Tesori (music) and David Lindsay-Abaire (lyrics) that will leave you both grinning and deeply touched.",

With the sanctioned wheels of the lawful justice system turning, the city's criminal underworld begins to have difficulties conducting business as usual. The streets are thick with police on high alert, conducting raids at every opportunity. In response, the city's mobsters devise a vigilante plan to capture the murderer and bring him to justice themselves.

At its core, Good Charlatan questions the existence of free will and reimagines how one simple lie can unfold into a spiral of truth. Ben Seidman guest-starred on the Netflix series Brainchild, produced by Pharrell, and starred in both Vanity Fair and WIRED\u2019s \u201cExperts React\u201d series, discussing magic, sleight of hand, and pickpocketing. Ben appeared in the Vanderpump Rules Season 9 premiere, starred in two specials on Travel Channel, and appeared twice on Penn & Teller: Fool Us. While known for large events, Ben also creates amazement at small private parties, including performances for Christina Aguilera, Woody Harrelson, and Zedd. He has dazzled CEOs, senators, and the late-great Robin Williams. Seidman was the only person in history to be named the Resident Magician at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. He was awarded the Princess Cruises \u201cEntertainer of the Year\u201d award and consulted on three seasons of Mindfreak on A&E, designing illusions for Criss Angel. Seidman taught magic to Johnny Knoxville and consulted on multiple feature films in the Jackass franchise. Internationally, he wrote and directed magic for SVT, the biggest TV channel in Sweden.

Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail\u2019s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, located in Downtown \u2014 at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 \u2014 opened in 2005. To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint.\u00a0 \u00a0The museum is located to the left of Security across from the cafe room. The use of cameras is NOT permitted.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). \u2018Vermiglio\u2019 shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family\u2019s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia\u2019s perspective \u2018Vermiglio\u2019 feels distinct and novel.

A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city\u2019s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin\u2019s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children\u2019s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor.

        "description": "\u201c\u2026a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz.\u201d \u2014 Jazz Times. Throughout their storied 43-year history, the Yellowjackets have recorded 26 albums, received 16 Grammy\u00ae nominations \u2013 won 2 \u2013 performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success. The Yellowjackets formed in the late 1970\u2019s as the backup band for guitarist Robben Ford. They recorded their first album together in 1980. Shortly after that recording, however, Ford decided to part ways and go in a different musical direction. As a result, the modern day Yellowjackets were formed \u2014 a trio with Russell Ferrante, Jimmy Haslip and Ricky Lawson. Since then, and with the addition of Bob Mintzer, the Yellowjackets have gained and maintained prominence as one of jazz\u2019s most influential and loved groups. Over the years the band has undergone numerous lineup changes. Never failing to rise to the inevitable challenges of adjustment, the Yellowjackets - Russell Ferrante, William Kennedy, Bob Mintzer - have maintained an extraordinarily high quality of musicianship that is the rival of many but a surprise to no one who knows and appreciates the band and their music. The most recent addition to the band adds Australian bass player Dane Alderson into the mix. With his exceptional rhythmic sensibility and natural disposition toward groove, Dane brings a new energy to the band and adds a youthful approach to the music. The Yellowjackets album \u201cRaising Our Voice\" was released in Fall 2018 and features special guest vocalist Luciana Souza. Their album \"Jackets XL with the WDR Big Band\" was nominated for a Grammy\u00ae in 2021. Their latest album \"Parallel Motion\" (2022) also received a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and is a true testament to the longevity and resilience of a band who debuted over 40 years ago. Consistently reinventing themselves through elevated instrumentation in their signature electro-acoustic soundscape, the current lineup showcases a collective at their prime.",

Her cast of zany southern characters and parody country music songs have pushed her to the top of the Spotify and Apple Music charts, earning her a cumulative following of 3.6M+ followers and nearly 2 billion views. Danae's debut Country/Comedy single \"Rode Hard\" peaked at No. 5 on the Country Global iTunes Charts, No. 8 on Billboard\u2019s Country Digital Song Sales, No. 22 on Billboard\u2019s Digital Song Sales, and No. 34 on Billboard\u2019s Emerging Artists. Earlier this year, Danae wrapped her debut comedy tour, which sold out in minutes. The tour has been extended through the end of the year and transitioned theaters. Danae and her wife, Mandie Kaii, host the weekly podcast called The Refined and Rowdy Show , where humor, heart and contrasting perspectives collide as they discuss everything from pop culture to heated issues. The podcast \u2014 which launched in Fall 2023 \u2014 just recently surpassed 1 million listeners. True to her multi-hyphenate nature, Danae's passion for acting landed her a role in \"Mother Nature and the Doomsday Prepper\" (which she just returned from filming in the spring of 2024) and \"Summer Camp\". Additionally, Danae has co-and-guest starred alongside many of the most notable names in entertainment including Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Tanya Christiansen and Josh Peck.",

Set against the backdrop of 1830\u2019s Paris,\u00a0La Boh\u00e8me\u00a0follows four impoverished artists surviving with little more than friendship, passion, and their love for art. When Roldolfo, a poet, and Mim\u00ec, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death. La Boh\u00e8me\u00a0will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it\u2019s no wonder Puccini\u2019s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT. Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs.",
