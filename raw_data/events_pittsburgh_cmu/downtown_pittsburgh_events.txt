Kimberly Akimbo.
Mar 4, 2025 - Mar 9, 2025.
Benedum Center 7th St and Penn Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
The 2023 Tony-winner for best musical, based on David Lindsay-Abaire's play of the same title, revolves around a teenage girl named Kimberly Levaco, who suffers from a condition that rapidly accelerates the aging process. Before she has had a chance to venture forth into the world as an adult, she finds herself turning into an old woman. Her story, unfolding like a dark fairy tale, is as whimsical as it is piercing. Yet the effect is powerfully life-affirming in the way it reminds audiences of the preciousness of the time we have at hand. Full of quirky humor and social satire on grownup immaturity, the musical features a score by Jeanine Tesori (music) and David Lindsay-Abaire (lyrics) that will leave you both grinning and deeply touched.

Lisiecki Performs Mozart.

Heinz Hall 600 Penn Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
Praised for his "pristine, lyrical and intelligent" playing (The New York Times), Jan Lisiecki returns to perform Mozart’s elegant and effervescent piano concerto. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony is filled with grand, sweeping, lyrical music tinged with brooding introspection. When his Fifth premiered in the US, Prokofiev’s picture graced the cover of Time Magazine, and the magazine’s lengthy profile of him quoted Koussevitzky’s assessment: “[The Fifth Symphony is] the greatest musical event in many, many years. The greatest since Brahms and Tchaikovsky! It is magnificent! It is yesterday, it is today, it is tomorrow.”. The March 7th performance will be broadcast live on WQED.

Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story.
Mar 7, 2025 - Mar 13, 2025.
Harris Theater 809 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
This star studded tribute brings into focus the dazzling, complex period of Liza Minnelli’s life starting in the 1970s, just after the tragic death of her mother Judy Garland—as she confronts a range of personal and professional challenges on the way to becoming a bona fide legend. Over these years, Liza seeks out extraordinary mentors: KayThompson, Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment. Directed by Bruce David Klein. 2024 | USA | English language | DCP.

International Art House Classics: M (1931) 35mm.
Mar 8, 2025 - Mar 13, 2025.
Harris Theater 809 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
Set in 1931 Berlin, M is the chilling tale of serial child murderer Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre, in a star-defining performance) and the community he terrorizes, its various strata and conceptions of justice. Opening with an unsolved murder, the film depicts a frantic hunt for the killer. With the sanctioned wheels of the lawful justice system turning, the city's criminal underworld begins to have difficulties conducting business as usual. The streets are thick with police on high alert, conducting raids at every opportunity. In response, the city's mobsters devise a vigilante plan to capture the murderer and bring him to justice themselves. The first sound film of German-Austrian master Fritz Lang, M has come to be considered the original psychological thriller, the begetter of what would come to be known as film noir — and a profound exploration of crime, punishment and justice. Directed by Fritz Lang. 1931 | Germany | German language with English subtitles | 35mm.

Ben Seidman in Good Charlatan.
Mar 5, 2025 - Mar 16, 2025.
Liberty Magic 811 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
Good Charlatan dives into the world of con artistry, pickpocketing, and real magic. The show is a hilarious and profoundly beautiful plunge into the underworld of those who use and abuse the powers of deception. Our tour guide, Ben Seidman combines sleight of hand and psychological deception to cheat at cards, pick your pockets, and demonstrate the importance of using our powers for good. At its core, Good Charlatan questions the existence of free will and reimagines how one simple lie can unfold into a spiral of truth. Ben Seidman guest-starred on the Netflix series Brainchild, produced by Pharrell, and starred in both Vanity Fair and WIRED’s “Experts React” series, discussing magic, sleight of hand, and pickpocketing. Ben appeared in the Vanderpump Rules Season 9 premiere, starred in two specials on Travel Channel, and appeared twice on Penn & Teller: Fool Us. While known for large events, Ben also creates amazement at small private parties, including performances for Christina Aguilera, Woody Harrelson, and Zedd. He has dazzled CEOs, senators, and the late-great Robin Williams. Seidman was the only person in history to be named the Resident Magician at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. He was awarded the Princess Cruises “Entertainer of the Year” award and consulted on three seasons of Mindfreak on A&E, designing illusions for Criss Angel. Seidman taught magic to Johnny Knoxville and consulted on multiple feature films in the Jackass franchise. Internationally, he wrote and directed magic for SVT, the biggest TV channel in Sweden. Ben lives in Los Angeles with his wife Sarah and his dog Juno.

Vermiglio.
Mar 7, 2025 - Mar 20, 2025.
Harris Theater 809 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
The lush and breathtaking beauty of the Alps, filmed with painterly grace under natural light from frigid winter to redemptive spring, provides the physical and emotional backdrop for ‘Vermiglio,’ Maura Delpero’s visionary film, which won the Silver Lion at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel. Italy’s Official Selection for the 2025 Academy Awards. Directed by Maura Delpero. 2024 | Italy, France, Belgium | Landin and Italian language with English Subtitles | DCP. Rated NR.

Universal Language.
Mar 14, 2025 - Mar 20, 2025.
Harris Theater 809 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
With deadpan, absurdist charm, Manitoban filmmaker Matthew Rankin triangulates a group of interconnected storylines set in a wintry, bleakly beautiful Winnipeg. Two kids discover a bank note frozen in a block of ice, which they hope to retrieve to buy their classmates a new pair of glasses. A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city’s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin’s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children’s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor. Directed by Matthew Rankin. 2024 | Canada | Farsi and French language with English subtitles | DCP.

The Yellowjackets.
Mar 27, 2025.
Greer Cabaret Theater 655 Penn Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
“…a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz.” — Jazz Times. Throughout their storied 43-year history, the Yellowjackets have recorded 26 albums, received 16 Grammy® nominations – won 2 – performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success. The Yellowjackets formed in the late 1970’s as the backup band for guitarist Robben Ford. They recorded their first album together in 1980. Shortly after that recording, however, Ford decided to part ways and go in a different musical direction. As a result, the modern day Yellowjackets were formed — a trio with Russell Ferrante, Jimmy Haslip and Ricky Lawson. Since then, and with the addition of Bob Mintzer, the Yellowjackets have gained and maintained prominence as one of jazz’s most influential and loved groups. Over the years the band has undergone numerous lineup changes. Never failing to rise to the inevitable challenges of adjustment, the Yellowjackets - Russell Ferrante, William Kennedy, Bob Mintzer - have maintained an extraordinarily high quality of musicianship that is the rival of many but a surprise to no one who knows and appreciates the band and their music. The most recent addition to the band adds Australian bass player Dane Alderson into the mix. With his exceptional rhythmic sensibility and natural disposition toward groove, Dane brings a new energy to the band and adds a youthful approach to the music. The Yellowjackets album “Raising Our Voice" was released in Fall 2018 and features special guest vocalist Luciana Souza. Their album "Jackets XL with the WDR Big Band" was nominated for a Grammy® in 2021. Their latest album "Parallel Motion" (2022) also received a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and is a true testament to the longevity and resilience of a band who debuted over 40 years ago. Consistently reinventing themselves through elevated instrumentation in their signature electro-acoustic soundscape, the current lineup showcases a collective at their prime.

Danae Hays: The First Time Tour.

Byham Theater 101 6th St Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
Alabama-bred and Nashville-based, comedian, actress, and content creator, Danae Hays represents a fresh, new female voice in the comedy, acting, and music worlds. Her cast of zany southern characters and parody country music songs have pushed her to the top of the Spotify and Apple Music charts, earning her a cumulative following of 3.6M+ followers and nearly 2 billion views. Danae's debut Country/Comedy single "Rode Hard" peaked at No. 5 on the Country Global iTunes Charts, No. 8 on Billboard’s Country Digital Song Sales, No. 22 on Billboard’s Digital Song Sales, and No. 34 on Billboard’s Emerging Artists. Earlier this year, Danae wrapped her debut comedy tour, which sold out in minutes. The tour has been extended through the end of the year and transitioned theaters. Danae and her wife, Mandie Kaii, host the weekly podcast called The Refined and Rowdy Show , where humor, heart and contrasting perspectives collide as they discuss everything from pop culture to heated issues. The podcast — which launched in Fall 2023 — just recently surpassed 1 million listeners. True to her multi-hyphenate nature, Danae's passion for acting landed her a role in "Mother Nature and the Doomsday Prepper" (which she just returned from filming in the spring of 2024) and "Summer Camp". Additionally, Danae has co-and-guest starred alongside many of the most notable names in entertainment including Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Tanya Christiansen and Josh Peck.

Benedum Center 7th St and Penn Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
His escape is her cage. In this groundbreaking new production created by an all-Japanese and Japanese American creative team, Madama Butterfly’s story is transported to a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect. Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry his fantasy girl and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real. Enveloped in Puccini’s stunning music, this visually beautiful production is the perfect match. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera , Detroit Opera , and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy.

Byham Theater 101 6th St Pittsburgh, PA 15222.
The Red Scare, tinted lavender. At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man. Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington. Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.
