You write songs? Where you playing at Saturday night? Why not? Remember Graffiti? It used to market itself as "the Greenwich Village Scene of Pittsburgh." Do you even know about the Greenwich Village scene? If you don't you should. Yes. Even the legendary voices of the Greenwich Village scene passed a hat and split the proceeds. And they came out to support each other. Not everyone got famous. Not everyone had a hit record. But they made something happen. Genius emerges from community. So if you write songs, get off your butt and get out and play. 412-828-2040.

La Voz que Soy, or The Voice I Am, is Afro-Latina soprano Zuly Inirio’s reinterpretation of the 1958 French opera La voix humaine. This multidisciplinary performance-in-progress uses the opera’s original framework—revisiting her past love through a final phone call—to explore colonialism, double consciousness, Black womanhood, and the African diaspora’s legacy. By intertwining these issues with the opera’s original themes of loss, assimilation, and the cost of self-preservation, La Voz que Soy highlights Zuly’s journey as a Black Latinx woman. The piece invites audiences into meaningful conversations about identity, resilience, and the shared experiences that connect us across diverse backgrounds. 412-363-3000.

Fugue explores the relationship between music, societal structures, and the way attention is manipulated in today’s world. The interplay of music and dance uses fugue’s fragmented structure as a metaphor to embody the struggle between focus and distraction, reflecting how modern life often pulls us away from our true selves. In this performance in progress, Anya also addresses the historical connection between Baroque music and 4123707079.

The Roots Cellar 6300 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, Pittsburgh Shadyside.
Abbie Gardner is a fiery dobro player with an infectious smile. Whether performing solo or with Americana darlings Red Molly, her acclaimed tales of love and loss, both gritty and sweet, are propelled by her impeccable slide guitar chops. Her live show is truly unique – as an award-winning songwriter, captivating vocalist, and a world-class lap-style dobro player, she has an unmistakable sound all her own. This sound of vocals and dobro unaccompanied is masterfully captured on her 2022 CD “DobroSinger.” The record made it to #11 on the Billboard Blues Charts and #2 on the Folk DJ Charts.
