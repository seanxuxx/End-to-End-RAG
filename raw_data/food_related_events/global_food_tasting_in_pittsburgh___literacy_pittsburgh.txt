EVENT HIGHLIGHTS.

International Food FairAt the heart of One Big Table is a sprawling international food fair presented by restaurants from our local neighborhoods, where chefs, culinary artists, and food enthusiasts come together to prepare and present a world-class selection of global cuisines from local restaurants. Many of the featured restaurants are immigrant-owned. Attendees can embark on a culinary journey, savoring dishes from every corner of the world, spicy Thai curries, flavorful Mexican empanadas, delicate French pastries, flaky Indian samosas, and so much more. The food fair offers a unique opportunity to taste, learn, and appreciate different culinary traditions..

Entertainment ExtravaganzaThe event is a feast not just for the palate but for all the senses, featuring an array of live performances that represent diverse cultures and talents from across the globe. Attendees can expect to be mesmerized by traditional dances, live music, and much more. Each performance adds to the vibrancy of the event, creating a unique atmosphere of celebration and unity..

Global MarketplaceFor those looking to take a piece of the world home, a global marketplace features unique products, souvenirs, and international handicrafts. It's a great opportunity to shop for one-of-a-kind items from around the globe. Some of the artists selected to participate may have benefited from Literacy Pittsburgh programming themselves..
WHO BENEFITS.

Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job..

Proceeds from One Big Table provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness..
