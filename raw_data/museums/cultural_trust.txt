Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Background and History 

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has overseen one of Pittsburgh’s most historic transformations: turning a seedy red-light district into a magnet destination for arts lovers, residents, visitors, and business owners. Founded in 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is a non-profit arts organization whose mission is the cultural and economic revitalization of a 14-block arts and entertainment/residential neighborhood called the Cultural District. The District is one of the country’s largest land masses “curated” by a single nonprofit arts organization. A major catalytic force in the city, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is a unique model of how public-private partnerships can reinvent a city with authenticity, innovation and creativity.

Using the arts as an economic catalyst, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has holistically created a world-renowned Cultural District that is revitalizing the city, improving the regional economy and enhancing Pittsburgh’s quality of life. Thanks to the support of foundations, corporations, government agencies and thousands of private citizens, the Trust stands as a national model of urban redevelopment through the arts.

Since 1984, the Trust has restored historic theaters, constructed new performance venues, commissioned public art projects and developed unique urban parks and riverfront recreation spaces. As one of the largest Downtown Pittsburgh property owners, the Trust manages one million square feet of property, including:

Theater Square, designed by architect Michael Graves, encompassing a parking garage, Cultural District box office, the restaurant Meat and Potatoes, the Backstage Bar
The 250-seat Greer Cabaret Theater
The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts (2870 seats)
Byham Theater (century-old vaudeville house with 1300 seats)
O’Reilly Theater (650-seat venue designed by Michael Graves)
Harris Theater (a foreign and contemporary film house)
Liberty Magic, an intimate, speakeasy performance space dedicated to the art of sleight of hand and prestidigitation
Agnes R. Katz Plaza, designed by Daniel Urban Kiley, featuring delightful “eyeball benches” and fountain by sculptor Louise Bourgeois
Allegheny Riverfront Park, a collaboration of artist Ann Hamilton and landscape designer Michael Van Valkenburgh

About the Cultural District
During the G-20 Pittsburgh Summit, the international focus was on the David L. Lawrence Convention Center located in Pittsburgh’s Cultural District, which is a project of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. This vibrant district sets the perfect stage for the international summit on economic recovery as a unique international model of urban revitalization through the arts and a paradigm for successful public-private partnerships. Once a blighted “adults-only” neighborhood known for sex shops, prostitutes and XXX-movie theaters, the Cultural District today attracts over 2,000,000 visitors annually generating an estimated economic impact of $303 million.

Pittsburgh’s third renaissance can be traced to H.J. “Jack” Heinz II, a founder of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Mr. Heinz envisioned a colossal transformation that would turn a city once called “hell with its lid off” into a thriving hub of world-class art and entertainment, buzzing with 24/7 activity. His vision was two-pronged: the arts could serve as a catalyst for economic, commercial and residential development of Downtown Pittsburgh, while enriching the quality of life for residents and visitors alike.

When other U.S. cities abandoned their respective downtowns for strip malls and big-box stores, Pittsburgh’s Cultural District preserved its historical significance by leveraging the power of the arts to create an authentic destination that draws over two million visitors, arts lovers, students, residents and employers to over 1,500 events each year.

The District includes Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh CLO, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Public Theater, Pittsburgh Symphony and August Wilson Center for African American Culture, among hundreds of other arts groups and artists. The Cultural District is also home to the city’s High School for Creative and Performing Arts.

Unlike other cities that house cultural activity within a single performing arts center, Pittsburgh’s Cultural District comprises 14 blocks that were holistically developed with the creation of multiple theaters, art galleries, public art projects, urban parks and riverfront recreation spaces.

Accessibility in Action: Using a Wheelchair in the Benedum Center
Fri, Jan 10, 2025
Written by: Andy Sharfman | Photos by: Allison Popieski
At the Cultural Trust, we believe that art is for everyone—but we also know that accessing cultural experiences isn’t always approachable, or even possible, without knowing what accommodations are available or what to expect from a particular event or venue.
That’s why we’re launching Accessibility in Action , a new blog series that will bring you the perspectives of patrons who use our accessibility services. Rather than simply telling you about what we offer, we're inviting community members to share their firsthand experiences as they navigate our spaces and attend our events.
These personal stories will give you practical insights into how our accommodations work in real time and how our staff is here to support you at every point of the way.
To kick off our series, we invited Tess Dally, a wheelchair user, and her friend Allison Popieski, to attend MJ the Musical at the Benedum Center last November. Tess documented her experience from start to finish, covering everything from the parking garage and her seat in the theater to her interactions with staff and navigating through the venue.
Meet Tess Dally
Tess has always been interested in the arts, but access hasn’t always been easy. For over thirty years, Tess lived in rural Alaska where the nearest theater was 300 miles away in Anchorage. Given the distance, attending a performance was truly “an event.”
During the pandemic, Tess decided to leave the West Coast for Pittsburgh. While the move brought her closer to a variety of artistic experiences, arriving during the pandemic meant that she had limited opportunities to experience the theater. Despite the initial setbacks, Tess has begun to explore Pittsburgh’s art scene in recent years, particularly from a professional standpoint. She currently serves as a teaching artist at Attack Theatre and is also part of a task force focused on assessing Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance across the city.
Now that you know a little more about Tess, let’s dive into her recent experience in theater!
Entering the Theater


Ready for an evening of theater, Tess and Allison began their experience in the Cultural District at the Theater Square Parking Garage , the closest parking option to the Benedum Center.
“I thought we were going to have a hard time finding a place to park because I didn’t bring my handicap tag, but we found a good place,” Tess said. “The garage and the streets were well-lit, which made it easier to make our way to the theater.” When they arrived at the Benedum, they decided to enter through the Guest Services Center.

Did you know?
The Guest Services Center is located to the right of the main entrance on 7th Street. The space is home to a variety of resources and accommodations for patrons, like assistive listening devices and captioning devices available for select performances. In future stories, we’ll explore this space and the equipment found here.

The entrance has double doors that are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair, but only one door was opened for Tess. With just one door open, the entrance wasn’t wide enough for her to comfortably pass through.
A staff member approached the colleague who had opened the door and explained that both doors should be opened for wheelchair users.
Afterwards, Tess and Allison moved through security to get their bags checked. During her time in the Guest Services Center, Tess took note of the friendly service.
“Your staff are incredible. Everyone was really kind and great.”
Since Tess’s visit, the electronics that operate the automatic doors have been replaced. We are also in the process of replacing the Guest Services Center doors, which should be installed in early January 2025. These new doors will address the door width issue and the entrance bump height.

Did you know?
The Benedum Center has a dedicated platform designed for wheelchairs. This section is located on the back right of the orchestra level (the main floor).

Tess described the wheelchair platform as “really wonderful” and “nice and leveled.” She also appreciated that there were seats available for loved ones to sit with wheelchair users.
“The line of sight was excellent. I couldn’t get over how wonderful it was. It was just amazing.”


Before the performance began, Tess struck up a conversation with others sitting nearby, including a few individuals with disabilities. As regular theatergoers, they talked about how comfortable they had felt during their previous experiences. One of the guests had a service dog, and Tess observed the positive impact it had on that individual and their ability to enjoy the show.
“During the performance there was some explosion and gun shot noises [as part of the sound effects] and we all noticed that in those moments it was really impactful for them to have their dog.”
Getting Drinks
Tess and Allison used their time during intermission to grab some refreshments at the bar in the Grand Lobby.

Did you know?
We have two ADA bar locations—in the Grand Lobby and the Patron Bar on the Promenade Level.
These bars were custom-built and installed in 2023, thanks to funds from a Regional Asset District (RAD) grant. Because the bar counters are lower, patrons and staff who use wheelchairs or mobility devices can more comfortably reach across the bar as they pay and receive their drinks and snacks.

While navigating the lobby, Tess noticed that the stanchions (rope dividers) had been moved around as the crowd flowed through, creating narrower pathways that made it a bit harder for her to maneuver. Once she reached the bar, however, Tess was thrilled with the service provided by the bartender.
“It was a really crazy time because when I ordered the drinks, it was right when they asked everyone to sit back down,” Tess said. “He could have been frazzled, but he took his time with me.”


Tess had previously visited the Benedum for a photoshoot early this spring and had provided feedback on how staff could better serve patrons at these stations. Seeing that feedback in action during her visit was a highlight for her.
Leaving the Theater
At the end of the performance, Tess watched as a staff member helped a patron transfer from their seat to their wheelchair.
“I just thought that was really wonderful,” she said. Another positive part of the experience was navigating through the Cultural District—both to the theater and back to the garage.
“I always feel really vulnerable in my wheelchair, and I thought that being downtown would be uncomfortable that late at night,” she admitted. “But we didn’t have any problems.”


Tess's Takeaways
Reflecting on her experience, Tess mentioned a few highlights:
“There were two things I was really impressed by—how helpful everyone was and how comfortable they were. They were just really comfortable with me. And that’s something I don’t always get.”
Tess added, “This experience was just really welcoming, and I didn’t just feel it with myself, but I felt it with everyone in my little area. It felt like a party!”
As someone who is often made to feel like “the other” in public spaces, Tess said this experience at the Benedum Center was a refreshing change.
“I don’t often go out because it’s just a challenge, but this was a good experience. I would tell anyone to go to the Benedum because you all are fantastic. It was a very comfortable experience.”
To help you choose the best ADA seating for your needs, here are a few factors to consider:

Two Ways to Extend Your Broadway Experience
Wed, Nov 27, 2024
Written by: Written by: Andy Sharfman | Talk Back Photos by: Krist Munoz-Malave
Our PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh season is in full swing! And while your mind might jump to the spectacles on stage (and rightfully so!), did you know that you can also connect with these productions beyond the stage and hear from the people who brought them to life?
Maybe you’re curious: How does an actor make it to Broadway? What’s life like on tour? or How does the cast and crew unwind after a performance? Thanks to Creative Conversations , our pre-show discussion, and B roadway Talk Backs , our post-show exchange, you can find answers to those questions and more at select performances.
With & Juliet recently in town, our Marketing team attended both events to give you a sense of the experience and hear from attendees themselves.
Set the Stage with Creative Conversations
Greeted with snacks and upbeat pop music, attendees for the & Juliet Creative Conversation gathered in the Trust Arts Education Center to explore the world of theater more closely.
Importantly, these events are open to everyone—regardless of whether you have a ticket to the show.
“It’s a great way to learn about careers in the arts and get to know the artists who are lucky enough to perform at the highest level in their field,” said Kalee George, Manager of Arts Education Programs at the Cultural Trust and the event coordinator for Creative Conversation.
Local theater professional Harper York kicked off the evening with questions for the panel, which included two swing actors from the & Juliet cast. For those who aren’t familiar, swing actors are performers trained to step into multiple roles on short notice.
“Living out of a suitcase isn’t the most glamorous,” one of the actors shared, “but it’s an exciting way to see different cities.”
The conversation ranged from Shakespearean trivia and the development of characters on stage to lighthearted topics like the actors’ favorite Halloween candy and memorable on-stage moments.
Next, the audience had the chance to satisfy their own curiosities. The actors were asked to speak on how they managed stage fright, auditioned for their roles, and collaborated with the creative team to add their own personal touch to the performance.
One attendee, a regular Creative Conversation goer, said these events help her understand “things you don’t even think about.” At a previous event, she recalls learning how an actor took care of their pet—an insight that allowed her to appreciate the fuller experience of being a traveling actor.
Beyond the personal, newcomers agreed that their main reason for attending this Creative Conversation was to get the “inside scoop.”
Another regular attendee shared how these events have prepared them for what they were about to see on stage. For example, at a previous event, they learned to look for the changing streetlamps in My Fair Lady as a symbol of character development.
Continue the Conversation with Talk Backs
Now, let’s pivot to the post-show experience. With the air still electric after the & Juliet cast had taken their bows, the audience was invited to stay for a deeper conversation.
While the roles represented by Talk Backs speakers do vary, those who choose to take part always come with a genuine desire to interact with theatergoers. “Their participation is completely voluntary,” shares Kristin Baker, Program Manager at the Cultural Trust and event coordinator for Talk Backs. “They engage in this experience out of a genuine passion for sharing their perspectives and cultivating a meaningful connection with the audience.”
Seven actors and the tour’s drummer stayed after the show this time, while Baker moderated the conversation.
Out of costume and dressed in casual attire, the performers spoke about their personal connection to the story and specific challenges in their roles. They also answered fun questions like what their characters' day jobs would be or what social media platforms they would use.
As with Creative Conversations, the audience played an active role in the Q&A session. Questions included: “What was your first Broadway show?” “What’s your dream role?” and “How do you keep up your stamina as a swing actor?”
After the event, a mother and daughter shared their reflections. As long-time subscribers, they always make sure to choose the performances with a Talk Back. This time, they swapped their tickets so that they could attend the discussion. When asked why, they pointed to the insights they’ve gained from the actors and creative teams. Even the small details—like learning an actor’s favorite candy—has helped them get to know the person behind the role and the experience they bring to it.
“It’s amazing to see what the actors are like and to understand their personality,” the mother shared. “We’re so lucky to have something like this in Pittsburgh.”
Next time, we hope you don’t just enjoy the show— come for the conversation!

About the Trust

Performing Arts. Visual Arts. Festivals. Arts Education. Urban Development.
Since 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit arts organization, has worked to make the Steel City a place where the arts can flourish. Our efforts have focused on the cultural and economic development of the Cultural District, a 14-square-block area of downtown Pittsburgh. What was once a downtrodden red light district now thrives as a vibrant center for culture, art, food, and community. Pittsburgh’s Cultural District stands as a nationwide model for how the arts can play a pivotal role in urban revitalization.
Each year, millions of people visit the Cultural District to expand their horizons in our theaters, galleries, and public art environments. Patrons enjoy thousands of world-class performing arts events and visual arts exhibitions . Pittsburgh residents of all ages connect and learn with the Trust’s comprehensive education and community engagement opportunities. Local arts organizations collaborate to build a stronger cultural community through the power of partnerships .

The Cultural District acts as the anchor for all of that work. The Trust’s superior venues and gallery spaces allow resident companies, community organizations, artists, and promoters to reach audiences large and small. In total, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust manages more than one million square feet of real estate in the District. Step outside those buildings to find numerous public art installations that beautify Pittsburgh's largest arts neighborhood.

Lauded as “the single greatest creative force in Pittsburgh because of its spirit of reinvention” by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Trust strives every day to enrich the city of Pittsburgh’s vibrancy, diversity, and prosperity.

Volunteering
Great Performances. Great People. Give the gift of time!
Our volunteers play an important role at The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust by providing support and leadership for our programs, projects and activities. Comprised of people of all ages and backgrounds, our corps of volunteers works to strengthen community awareness and public appreciation for the Trust, contribute to its financial strength, and provide vital support services to its staff.

How to Apply

Thank you for your interest in supporting the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. To complete your Volunteer Application Form online, you will be directed to a new site powered by Better Impact, where you can create or log into an existing account.

Volunteer FAQs
How old do I have to be to volunteer?
Minimum age requirement is 16 years of age. There is no maximum age limit, although we ask that you be mindful of the physical requirements of volunteering.
What are the physical requirements to volunteer?
Volunteers must be able to stand for extended periods of time, especially during the portions of the shift when guests enter, exit, and otherwise navigate the venue (intermission, etc.) You must also be comfortable navigating slightly sloped passageways and steps in dimly lit or dark spaces of the theater.
What is the time commitment for a shift?
Each event is very different, but a typical shift is between 4-6 hours. You will see the start and approximate end times very clearly in the online portal before signing up for a shift.
What is the time commitment year-round?
We ask that every volunteer do at least 75 hours in a calendar year to remain an active volunteer in the program. New volunteers must complete 25 hours within the first 90 days after their orientation.
What are the uniform requirements?
We ask that you provide a white button-down long sleeve dress shirt, black dress pants, fully black shoes, and black socks. The Trust will provide you with a black vest and a basic black bowtie.
Outdoor events are casual attire, or an event T-shirt may be provided.
In-depth uniform requirements will be covered at the orientation.
What opportunities are included if I sign up to volunteer?
We have many opportunities year-round to volunteer.
Theater opportunities include events at the Benedum Theater, Byham Theater, Greer Cabaret Theater, or Liberty Magic.
We do NOT offer opportunities at Heinz Hall or the O’Reilly Theater through this program.
Other opportunities include the Three Rivers Arts Festival , First Night Festival , Gallery Crawls , helping with Tours of our venues, and other miscellaneous events.
What will I be doing as a volunteer?
The volunteer function varies depending on the show and whether it is an indoors or outdoors event, but our volunteers handle various guest-facing tasks such as scanning tickets, greeting patrons, taking patrons to their seat, coat check room support, and donor lounge support.
How does scheduling work?
Scheduling is flexible! You pick and choose your own shifts. All our scheduling is done through an online portal that is very easy to use.
Because there are so many different events that you can sign up for, people from all walks of life (students, working, retired, etc.) are able to make it work due to the flexible scheduling.
How often are orientations?
Once every quarter. Each one is on a Saturday from 9am-5pm at the Benedum or Byham theaters.
What happens after I apply?
Please note that not all applicants are accepted. After applying, you will receive an email prompting you to take a short quiz about this FAQ section. After that, you will be prompted to reach out and schedule a 15-20 min phone screening interview. If you pass these steps, you will be invited to attend the next orientation.
What happens after orientation?
If you’ve got your uniform components ready, you are welcome to start signing up to volunteer! (Please see the question above for uniform requirements. The vest will be provided at your first volunteering shift after your orientation).
Your first 90 days will be a “shadowing” period, where you will be paired up with another volunteer to learn the ropes at any shift you attend.
Can I come to part of an orientation?
No. You will have to be there for the entirety of the orientation to be eligible for the program. The reason for the long orientation is that we are preparing you for so many volunteering opportunities in our Cultural District.
What about parking?
We provide parking validation in the Theater Square Parking garage for any volunteering shift or training that you participate in.
Are there short-term volunteering commitments available?
Currently, we do not have any short-term or “day of service” volunteering opportunities available. Please contact the Volunteer Services and Front of House Guest Experience department for more information ( rieser@trustarts.org ).
What kind of environment is this volunteer experience?
It is a fun, fast-paced, team-driven environment where you interact with guests and make sure they are having magical experiences!
I know some people who want to join, what should they do?
Have them apply at trustarts.org/volunteer . Everyone must individually do an application, FAQ quiz, phone call, and attend an orientation to be eligible to volunteer.
They can email vthomas@trustarts.org if they have any questions!
Will I get to watch the show?
Volunteers are responsible for creating magical guest experiences for our patrons. The main function of the volunteer program is to share a love of the arts with our guests and create an environment where they want to return time and again. With this focus in mind, volunteers do not get to see the entirety of a performance. An opportunity to watch portions of the events must be balanced with the primary responsibility of ensuring that guests' needs are met and given priority.

Volunteer Mission Statement
Our priority is to help others enjoy the beautiful gift of art by creating a warm atmosphere and unforgettable experiences that excite and attract diverse audiences again and again to our venues and festivals. The Cultural Trust’s community of volunteers supports and cultivates an environment where all feel welcome to enjoy performing, visual, and public art.
Volunteer Vision Statement
We will provide a professional, first in-class guest experience for every visitor. Our volunteers and the outstanding service they provide to the community will be one of the many reasons people continue to frequent Pittsburgh’s Cultural District.
Through a more inclusive group of volunteers, we will strive to connect with all persons by creating a place where both volunteers and guests feel comfortable, accepted, and valued. We aspire to provide all with a fulfilling and gratifying experience in the arts.
Our volunteers will promote a strong sense of pride, community awareness, and public appreciation for the Cultural Trust by creating and enhancing relationships both within the Cultural District and beyond.
Volunteer Values

Opportunities
Volunteers may participate in a broad spectrum of programs and activities depending on their interests and flexible options accommodate each volunteer's personal schedule. Daytime or evening, weekday, or weekend. There's often an activity to fit any schedule.
Volunteers may participate in activities in the following areas:
Giving is Rewarding. Becoming a volunteer makes you a part of theTrust family. As you share your talents and interests with fellow volunteers, you also learn more about the inner workings of the theater, its programs, and its role in the community.
Some of the other benefits include tickets to performances and an invitation to volunteer recognition celebrations.

Welcome, New Volunteers!
This past Saturday we officially welcomed in over 60 new volunteers into our program, including 30 new Beyond the Stage volunteers!
Dia de los Muertos
Deb Blackburn - October 21 there were ten of us volunteering for Dia de los Muertos activities and we spent the morning making bright tissue paper flowers, gluing ribbons and tiny clothespin's to monarch butterflies of different sizes (to write names of the deceased on and hung on the ofrenda at the Happy Hour,)  plus fluffing long strings of marigolds that arrive compressed. We all enjoyed creating different colored/sized flowers, with the smaller to be attached to sugar skulls on another day.  According to Mexican belief Monarch butterflies are said to be the souls of the dead.
Patron Survey Remarks
“Loved the show. Staff was excellent including handling what appeared to be a medical issue with a guest during the performance.”
“All the staff & volunteers were very cordial & helpful! Great show!”
“Justin [Blain] is amazing front door greeter. He always greets me with a welcome and smile.”
"Your facility was lovely. Your employees were so nice and helpful. It was super easy to get into the building."
Inventory Shoutout
A shoutout to Deb Blackburn, Kim Janocko, and BTS volunteers Carola, Amayla, Abigail, and Camille for coming in to help make name tags for the new volunteers!
November 8 – Beauty and the Beast – Denise Filippino
I had the pleasure of working with 4 Beyond the Stage students. Amelia, Madison, Jean & Sam. These young ladies were very professional & friendly with the patrons. They engaged very well with everyone, & asked questions if they were unsure. They have bright futures ahead of them. What a joy to have bright, energetic, students to be a part of our family! Great job girls!
November 16 – Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan – David Balint
I asked Volunteer Wayfinder Daniel Kerr to be positioned halfway up the slope at the Byham for the dance show on Saturday 11/16. He went above and beyond what needed to be done. He spoke almost non-stop welcoming patrons and offering directions with a smile. Well done, Dan. 
I discovered he's also a math wiz as he demonstrated to me and ticket scanners Paulette Sadowski, Barb Murdick, and Kim Pfadt. You could tell he enjoyed what he was doing.

I was impressed with the FOH staff and security at the Byham last night. Greg, Goia, and Caleb went out of their way to help patrons with visual impairments get through security, ticket scanning, and move up the LONG ramp at the Byham. Don Sivavec, House Manager, was also helpful with wheelchair use on the ramp AND in the theater. Some of our patrons have multiple disabilities and the PCT staff has been caring and helpful to them in so many ways.
April 24, 2024 – Harris Theater Rent screening

April 19, 2024 – Greer post-show event – Kathy Griffin

April 19, 2024 – Company – Paul Armbruster
On the Friday, April 19, performance of Company I experienced something in all my fourteen years as an usher plus two years as a manager, that I never experienced before. I was standing at Mezzanine house left when a young man came up to me and said, “My wife is immunosuppressed and where we are sitting there are a lot of people around us. Would it be possible for us to move where there are less people?” Fortunately for them the Mezzanine and Balcony levels did have many empty seats that night. I replied, “I can move you into this row (pointing at row K."
I felt compelled to talk to the couple so I moved into the empty row and while leaving a seat between us I asked the girl, “Are you a recipient?” She replied that she was a heart recipient. I said to them, “I am a recipient as well. I had a liver transplant and this coming October 5th will be 22 years since my transplant!” Their eyes opened wide with amazement. She informed me that it is almost one year since her transplant operation. We briefly talked about transplantation then I left them to enjoy the show. However, I felt, and I think that she felt as well, an immediate and unique bond between us. It was the first time I met a patron who was a fellow recipient.
I know that after such a serious operation how it’s natural to have a fear that something still may go wrong. However, I hope that I was able to provide her with some inspiration that her future would be bright. As they passed me on their way out after the show the young man extended his hand and as we shook hands, I wished them “Good luck!” Although they were both wearing masks, I could clearly see that they were both smiling from ear to ear. Maybe, just maybe, I made a difference that night.
April 13, 2024 – Dog Man the Musical – note from a Patron
My family and I visited the Byham Theater yesterday, April 13th for the DogMan Musical with my 8-year-old son who is an AVID DogMan fan, and we just wanted to let you all know about the absolutely FANTASTIC time we had! We often use Kulture City sensory bags when we visit PNC Park, so when my son learned that they were offered at the theater, he was thrilled. From the moment we entered, though, the staff was phenomenal - friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating - fabulous all around! This was our first visit to this theater, but rest assured we will return! Thank you so much for a great experience! My son had the night of his life, and we enjoyed watching him have a blast.
April 13, 2024 – Barb Mills
I was in the ladies room leaving @ the Opera Brown Bag recital, & I overhead a random patron waiting in the long line. 'When I go to the Benedum, the ushers there are so nice & do a great job of moving the Ladies Room line along'. I said Thank You on behalf of the Cultural Trust Staff; she had no idea I am an usher! My heart smiled.
April 11, 2024 – Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me! – Laura Kubicki
I want to give a huge shout-out to the "Dream Team" of six volunteers on the Mezzanine Level during the Thursday, 04/11 performance of Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me! Kudos to Judy Cunningham, Denise Filipino, Linda Cwynar, Carol Yurechko, Sandra Deforno, and Kim Weismann. These fantastic ushers worked extremely well together - a true team effort! Judy, Denise, Linda, and Carol seated patrons quite efficiently and with great enthusiasm. Kim and Sandra were Directors and stationed outside each Mezzanine door. They welcomed each guest, checked their tickets, and accurately directed patrons onto the Mezzanine level or up to the Balcony level. This teamwork was very much appreciated by a sold-out theater of patrons. Thank you all once again!
March 31, 2024 – Mamma Mia
A special shout out to all the volunteers and staff who participated during a busy Easter weekend with sold out shows!
March 29, 2024 – Mamma Mia – Jonathan Nadle
During the Friday evening show, a couple was brought into guest services for a ticket issue - one that apparently wasn't of their own making. It was pushing 8 PM and Matt worked quickly to get them good tickets. The gentleman looked concerned, so I reassured him they still had 7 minutes to be seated. He looked relieved and thanked us, saying, "Everyone is so helpful. That's why we keep coming back." I directed them to the proper inner lobby door, another usher took over, and they made it to their seats just before the hold.
March 19, 2024 – La Traviata – Barbara Mills
I ushered my first Opera last evening in the Mezzanine with Wayne [Madden], and I loved it. The Opera patrons were very gracious! I loved it so much I emailed Mr. Christopher Hahn, thanking him for keeping Opera alive in Pittsburgh. He responded quickly, and was touched that I reached out. My next show to usher is Herbie Hancock, which I am looking forward to.
March 17, 2024 – La Traviata – Diane Reimer
House manager Jordyn Smith always stops by to speak to the ushers during a performance to ask how it's going and to say thanks. I was working on the Promenade on Saturday evening when she stopped by during an intermission. She has done this every time when I have been there for a performance and she is a house manager. I appreciate that she takes the time during a show to do this. Thank you, Jordyn!
February 16, 2024 – PBT Beauty and the Beast – Diane Basty
I had some wonderful experiences at the Friday night performance of the ballet, Beauty and the Beast, at the Benedum. Great reminders of how fortunate we are to work for The Trust and with one another. We, as a whole, provide and receive great reward in what our roles are within our venues. As a backdrop, the sparkle of the snow set a beautiful outdoor setting. A distinguished gentleman turned to me with noticeable excitement as he entered the Benedum and said, “we’ve never seen snow before, we’re from Texas!”. His awe stayed with me the duration of the night. If that wasn’t enough, shortly following this, a car pulled up and as we approached the car door, the most adorable young girl stepped out in full ball gown; head to toe, as Belle! She stopped the show for us. You never know what’s around the corner!

February 21, 2024 – The Life and Music of George Michael – Justin Williams
I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Dan Hadfield for his pragmatic resolution of an issue in Box 112 tonight. The guests with those seats requested 3 bariatric chairs and we only had 1 available. Dan spoke with them and was able to provide a bench and the guests were very pleased with his accommodation. Additionally, Paul Armbruster was able to assist a guest that was apprehensive to use the stairs from the balcony elevator to Row F by allowing her and her companion to sit in Row L on the Gallery Level.
February 23, 2024 – Rainbow Fish Student Matinee – Kevin Wilkes
Our FOH team had the Friday Fish (Rainbow) Special in full effect at the Byham today! Our House and floor managers were great today as well as well as all of our fantastic volunteers. They took extra special care of all the little tadpoles today. They Byham was filled with children for some great programing from our Trust Arts Education team. Special shoutout to Mary Levine! She was a rockstar as our bus wrangler. She left no student behind . Kudos to EVERYONE!
Greer – Judy Campagna
I wanted to let you know how much I love working at the Greer with Don and his management staff. Feel like part of the family there…even with waiters, bartenders, and bar manager. Really enjoyed the show The Perfect Mate and we had a really nice volunteer crew working it.
First Night
A highlight of the evening was the revamped tours program with trained staff and volunteers this year. In total, we gave tours to over 900 people at the Benedum and 700 at the Byham!

Most Hours Volunteered in 2023
She’s done it again! Ginny Kasserman finished with the most hours for the second consecutive year in a row. In 2023, she had a staggering 703.18 HOURS. To put that in perspective, that equates to over 29 FULL DAYS of volunteering in a year! (That’s more than all of February – even in a leap year!) As a reward for her incredible services, Ginny received a complimentary one-year membership to the Trust donors’ lounges! We are thankful to everyone who contributes their time to create magical guest experiences with us year-round, and we are especially grateful to Ginny for her enormous contributions!
Thank you for all that you do, Ginny!

December 2, 2023 – Mrs. Doubtfire
November 26, 2023 – Phyllis Boykin
What a treat for some FOH team members- the true stars of the evening! What an honor to have a picture with the famous Mirror Ball trophy from Dancing With The Stars.
November 20, 2023 – Laura Kubicki
Kudos and a huge thank you to the “Dream Team” of Cindy McCormick, Linda Cwynar, Carol Yurechko, Ruthie Fox, Nancy Geraci, Sharon Greb, Michelle Radziminski, and Kim Weismann - the eight volunteer ushers who worked the sold out Rock Orchestra by Candlelight show! They worked fabulously together as a team, whether it be seating patrons, pleasantly interacting with many first-time patrons, covering the long line at the ladies room during intermission, or taking turns guarding the ever-important exit doors, they did their roles with enthusiasm and gusto! Thank you all!
October 31, 2023 – Christine Castner
I feel very much a part of a team and my role as a volunteer is that of support. My eyes have been opened to the depth of the Cultural Trust and I am amazed at this remarkable organization within our city. I am proud to be able to be connected to and support the Trust. I am being rewarded with remarkable benefits of experiences with every shift I am able to take. I truly love this volunteer experience.
October 23, 2023 – Beyond The Stage Launch & New Volunteers – Vinay Thomas
I am so thrilled to share that we have launched year 2 of our Beyond The Stage student volunteer program with just over 30 new students from CAPA!

In addition to the students, we also welcomed in many new volunteers this weekend at the latest new volunteer orientation!

October 6, 2023 – Sugar Skull Student Matinee

October 1, 2023 – Artist Car Workshop – Barb M.
It was a great day for the Artist Car Workshop. Cultural Trust Volunteers, Barb Martinelli and Shelly Hartge pitched in to help artist, Cheryl Capezzuti, and her crew prepare cars for the downtown Pittsburgh New Years' Eve celebration.
September 27, 2023 – Moulin Rouge – Roseann B.
Being emeritus I’m not able to usher as often as I’d like, but when I do it’s always great! Especially the opening night of Moulin Rouge. Not only was the show so good, but the people I encountered really made my evening! There was the couple who had just moved from Wisconsin and was so thrilled to be there, the gentlemen who had never been to the Benedum and was in awe of our beautiful theater and, of course, the people I worked with. Our floor manager, Erica in the mezzanine, was so nice and fun!. I enjoyed ushering and talking with Andrea, who had some very interesting stories, and of course my BFF, Louise who I met as a result of ushering. And it’s always nice when I get to see ladies and gentlemen who I’ve met over the years. You know who you are. When people say we do this to see the shows they may be right but it’s so much more than that!
September 25, 2023 – Note from Denise M
Everyone has been beyond welcoming and kind. I’m loving my experiences. Thank you.
September 24, 2023 – Bluey's Big Play – Deb B.
My Grandson, Clark and I attended the Saturday morning Bluey performance! He had the time of his life meeting my fellow Volunteers/Floor & House Managers, and particularly getting a big soft pretzel and Bluey light toy! The theater was full of Bluey fans!
September 22, 2023 – Beyond The Stage Year 2 Launch – Vinay T.
We are continuing our Beyond the Stage program and have added more student volunteers from Pittsburgh CAPA. The program begins soon and you will see these students in the theaters following the next orientation on October 21!
September 15, 2023 – Tick, Tick..Boom! – Carol W.
Shout out to Kathy who was one of the first five ushers to work the new Greer and help management there iron out kinks before tickets go live.
September 14, 2023 – Steve Martin & Martin Short – Carol W.
Shout out to new usher Sylvia, who I worked with on the prom on Thursday night for Steve Martin and Martin Short. It was really busy, and she expressed frustration that she made a couple of missteps. But she was a star in my eyes. She worked like a trooper, climbing up and down the stairs, helping people to get to their seats. And she stuck with it. She’s going to be a great usher. Let’s encourage her!
September 13, 2023 – Ray LaMontagne – Crystal S.
Frank -ticket scanner - is always very happy and enthusiastic. Frank's energy is contagious. Also willing to share a laugh with a very cute joke.
September 11, 2023 – Volunteer Appreciation Party – Vinay T.
I am so delighted to share a special good news edition following our amazing Volunteer Appreciation Party last week at the Byham. We say it time and time again, but we are so thankful to you volunteers for going above and beyond to provide a magical guest experience and make our events so successful. We KNOW we have the best volunteer family in the world! The evening was filled with food, entertainment, prizes, ducks, bingo, and so much more!

May 23, 2023 – John Mellencamp – Carol W.
Went to the John Mellencamp concert and all we got were these silly armbands! LOL, for about 5 minutes we were fill-ins in the fourth row from the stage.

May 26 – Beyond the Stage Awards Ceremony – Vinay T.
We successfully concluded the first year of the Beyond the Stage program, which saw more than 20 CAPA students volunteer with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for a school year — with a final awards ceremony meeting where the students met with CEO Kendra Ingram. In total, the students committed 1456.583 hours as volunteers. That averages out to approximately 60 hours per student in just 8 months (Sept 2022 – May 2023). Students volunteered for over 60 different events at the Benedum, Byham, Liberty Magic, Art Galleries, Gallery Crawls, the Children’s Theater Festival, the Three Rivers Arts Festival, the Humanities Festival, and even the UPMC Rink at PPG Place!


June 2, 2023 – KANSAS – Emily B.
The team tonight did a really great job with the pre-show event. Everybody helping out (Diane, Rachel, Mary and Amanda) was extremely willing to roll with the punches and do whatever was needed to make the event happen.
June 3, 2023 – Pride Festival Volunteers - Jonathan F.
Just wanted to send along a huge thank you the volunteers: Kathleen, Mali, Dawn, Deb, Deb, & Dana. I leaned on them hard, it was busy, chaotic at times, and hot, and they were all smiles, helpful, and kind to all the festival goers. There’s no way this booth would have been successful without them – I hope they had a good time and felt valuable, because each of them were rockstars. Special shoutout to Deb B. for her staying from start to end – so grateful to her and her generous donation of her time and energy!


June 2-11, 2023 – Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival - Vinay T.
If I were to capture every single comment and moment I personally witnessed, along with everything you all reported to me, we'd have to publish a "TRAF Good News" book! We successfully gave away every single Dollar Bank tote bag, captured a lot of survey feedback, and so much more.
