A department of the Jewish Community Center (JCC) of Greater Pittsburgh, the museum is located in the Squirrel Hill JCC at the corner Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue, in the heart of Pittsburgh's historically Jewish neighborhood.  The museum was founded in 1998, and though it does not have a permanent collection, it hosts several original and traveling exhibitions each year.  The AJM aims to explore contemporary Jewish issues through art and related programs that facilitate intercultural dialogue. [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Prior to 1998, the JCC of Greater Pittsburgh had a small community gallery for nearly 25 years.  Under the auspices of Leslie A. Golomb Archived 2010-05-14 at the Wayback Machine , the gallery underwent a period of substantial growth, evolving into a museum and receiving accreditation from the Council of American Jewish Museums (CAJM). [ 2 ] Accreditation by CAJM requires strict adherence to standards regarding archives, catalogues, and curating, as well as educational programs and outreach. Today, the AJM galleries are still located on the Pittsburgh JCC's Squirrel Hill campus.  While the AJM continues to emphasize the Pittsburgh community in its exhibitions and programming, its scope has grown as it collaborates with regional, national, and international artists and organizations.  Additionally, the AJM frequently explores Jewish themes such as contemporary iterations of rituals, but aims to reach the wider community though exhibits with broad appeal and programming that encourages interfaith discourse. Recent exhibitions [ edit ] As a non-collecting museum, the AJM works with local, national, and international artists to create original exhibitions, [ 3 ] and occasionally hosts traveling exhibitions from institutions such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum .

It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist. [ 4 ] The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol . The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute , the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWFVA). [ 5 ] Warhol Self Portrait Exhibit in 2010 The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m 2 ) facility on seven floors.  Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget (2010) was $6.1 million.  In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996. [ 6 ] History [ edit ] Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989, [ 7 ] about 2½ years after Warhol's death. At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated $80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation. [ 7 ] Thomas N. Armstrong III , who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993. [ 8 ] Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work. [ 9 ] By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m 2 ) industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about $12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over $55 million, [ 8 ] a donation that grew to about 3,000 works. [ 4 ] On May 13–14, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend. [ 4 ] Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening; at the time of his resignation, the museum had had "tense relations" with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation. [ 4 ] On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum. [ 10 ] In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan , New York City , in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side , an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex. [ 16 ] In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed , based on Warhol's 1975 book, “ The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again ”, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh. [ 17 ] In 2022, the museum announced a $60 million expansion deemed The 'Pop District' covering six blocks in Pittsburgh, PA. The expansion looks to build a music venue, a social media studio called Warhol Creative, and expand places for public art exhibits. [ 18 ] The proposed site would be around 58,000 square feet (17,500 square meters), including a first-floor concert venue with standing room for up to 1,000 people, a second-floor mezzanine, and an events space that could hold up to 360 people on the fourth floor. The third floor would be used for offices and support spaces. [ 19 ] The project is expected to take ten years and is funded primarily through local foundations. [ 20 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Display of Interview magazine covers The 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event.  The film's subject was hosting the event. The Andy Warhol Diaries (TV series) in 2022 prominently featured museum staff as narrators of Warhol's life.

Williams, Perkins and Will Website aacc-awc.org The 2009 grand opening The stage The August Wilson African American Cultural Center is a U.S. nonprofit arts organization based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , that presents performing and visual arts programs that celebrate the contributions of African Americans not only in Western Pennsylvania , but nationally and internationally. The August Wilson African American Cultural Center building is on Liberty Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh 's Cultural District . It includes galleries, classrooms, a 500-seat theater, a gift shop, a cafe, and many multi-purpose spaces for visual and performing art. The museum opened in 2009. History [ edit ] The August Wilson Center was part of a plan drawn up by Pittsburgh NAACP President Tim Stevens in 1996 in order to try to bring the National NAACP Convention to Pittsburgh. In the plan, there was a statement that urged the Mayor of Pittsburgh to provide financial backing for an African American Museum. Later in 1996, then-Mayor Tom Murphy charged two City Council Members, Sala Udin and Valerie McDonald with bringing stakeholders together to discuss the museum's future. Funding from various sources, including the URA, State of Pennsylvania, and The Heinz Endowments came together to begin construction of the center. The land on which the center sits was taken by eminent domain and sold to the museum for $1. The center celebrated its "topping off" ceremony on August 12, 2008, at 12:30 pm. Construction was completed shortly thereafter and the museum was open to the full public on September 17 and 19, 2009. [ 1 ] The August Wilson Center was designed under the direction of Allison G. Williams, FAIA and members of her team from her San Francisco office of Perkins and Will . During the design of this project, AI merged with MBT Architecture and then was subsequently bought by Perkins+Will. The project design was completed in the San Francisco office of Perkins+Will. Team members included Greg Lehman, Sally Curtis, Stacie Velten. [ 2 ] In February 2019, the August Wilson Center for African American Culture (the center's original name) changed its name to the August Wilson Cultural Center, [ 3 ] and the following month, to the August Wilson African American Cultural Center (the latter change, following an online petition objecting to the deletion of "African American" from its name). [ 4 ] Debt troubles [ edit ] The center struggled to pay off its construction debt from 2012, on January 20, 2014, a federal bankruptcy official reported that the center's debt situation might be irreversible. [ 5 ] Subsequently, a federal court ruled on January 27, 2014, that the center's liquidation could begin to pay off debts. [ 6 ] In February 2014 concerned stakeholders started a website to raise funds for the center. [ 7 ] After numerous court cases, the center was sold at a sheriff's sale on November 3, 2014, to the mortgage holder, Dollar Bank  for $1,912.50. [ 8 ] On November 5, 2014 Dollar Bank sold the center to a nonprofit consortium for $7.9 million. The consortium included contributions from private foundations: $2.45 million from the Heinz Endowments , $2.35 million from the Richard King Mellon Foundation , $500,000 from the Pittsburgh Foundation and $500,000 from the Thomas Tull Family Foundation. Public sources contributed another $3.15 million: $1.65 million from the Urban Redevelopment Authority and $1.5 million from the Allegheny Regional Asset District . [ 9 ] The court-appointed conservator had originally agreed to sell the building for $9.5 million to a private developer, 980 Liberty Partners, who had planned to build a hotel on top of the center. Pittsburgh Major Bill Peduto , Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and the URA fought the bid. 980 Liberty Partners withdrew in a September 2014 settlement that favored the consortium of local foundations. 980 Liberty partners was reimbursed $360,000 from URA's share of the purchase price. [ 9 ] By 2019, the center was on a solid financial foundation, having ended 2018 with a budget surplus and was building a capital reserve. [ 10 ] By 2020, the center was showing additional signs of recovery, having increased its operating budget to $7.25 million from $1.77 million in 2015 and increased the percentage of the budget coming from earned income to 17% from 5%. The center had greatly increased its individual donor base and held substantially more events. [ 11 ] References [ edit ] ^ "August Wilson Center for African American Culture" .

The museum was originally known as the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute and was formerly located at what is now the Main Branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. The museum's first gallery was opened for public viewing on November 5, 1895. Over the years, the gallery vastly increased in size, with a new building on Forbes Avenue built in 1907. In 1963, the name was officially changed to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute. The size of the gallery has tripled over time, and it was officially renamed in 1986 to "Carnegie Museum of Art" to indicate it clearly as one of the four Carnegie Museums . [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie first thought of setting up a museum in 1886 [ 2 ] that would preserve a "record of the progress and development of pictorial art in America." Dedicated on November 5, 1895, the art gallery was initially housed in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's Main Branch in Oakland . Carnegie initially envisioned a museum collection consisting of the " Old Masters of tomorrow". [ 3 ] The museum received a major expansion in 1907 with the addition of the Hall of Architecture, Hall of Sculpture, and Bruce Galleries, with funds again provided by Carnegie. [ 4 ] Under the directorship of Leon A. Arkus, the Sarah Mellon Scaife Gallery (125,000 square feet) was built as an addition to the existing Carnegie Institute. Designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes , it first opened in 1974 and more than doubled the museum's exhibition space, also adding a children's studio, theater, café, offices, and bookstore. [ 5 ] The New York Times art critic John Russell described the gallery as an "unflawed paradise." The gallery has been renovated several times since its original creation, most recently in 2004. Today the museum also stages the Carnegie International every few years. Numerous significant works from the Internationals have been acquired for museum's permanent collection including Winslow Homer 's The Wreck (1896) and James A. McNeill Whistler 's Arrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate (1884). Collections and departments [ edit ] Neapolitan presepio seasonally displayed at the Carnegie Museum of Art The museum's curatorial departments include: Fine Arts (Contemporary Art, Works on Paper), Decorative Arts, Architecture and Photography. Every year, the museum hosts up to 15 different exhibitions. Approximately 35,000 pieces make up its permanent collection, which also includes works on paper, paintings, prints (particularly Japanese prints), sculptures, and installations from the late seventeenth century to the present. The museum has notably strong collections of both aluminum relics and chairs. Approximately 1,800 works are on view at any given time. The museum also maintains a large archive of negatives from African American photographer Charles "Teenie" Harris . [ 3 ] Heinz Architectural Center - The collection includes works in architecture, landscape design, engineering, and furniture and interior design. The center's facilities includes 4,000 square feet of exhibition space and a library housing several thousand books and journals. The Hillman Photography Initiative - The Initiative hosts a variety of projects including live public events, web-based projects, documentary videos, art projects, and writing. Yearly programming is determine by a group of five "agents" who plan and curate each 12-month cycle of works hosted.

[ 8 ] Hall of Architecture (1907) – The Hall of Architecture houses almost 140 full-size plaster casts of elements of buildings found in the ancient and classical civilizations of Egypt , Greece and Rome , and from Romanesque , Gothic and Renaissance Europe. It is the largest collection of plaster casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world, along with those of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Musée national des Monuments Français in Paris . [ 9 ] Hall of Sculpture (1907) – The Hall of Sculpture was modeled after the Parthenon 's inner sanctuary and was originally created to house the museum's 69 plaster casts of Egyptian , Near Eastern , Greek , and Roman sculpture . Today it exhibits works from the permanent collections, with its balcony displaying decorative arts objects from the eighteenth to the twentieth century.

Forum Gallery – Located on the first floor of the museum just inside the Forbes Avenue entrance, this single room is dedicated to temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. It opened November 3, 1990, with support from the National Endowment of the Arts – The first exhibition, Forum 1 , was a solo show of Jeff Wall. Subsequent exhibitions were numbered sequentially (for example, Forum 40 featured Felix de la Concha). Unlike larger museum exhibitions, which can take up to three years to plan and execute, Forum shows come together relatively quickly, and are open to any curatorial staff's vision. In the words of Vicky Clark, a longtime curator at the museum, "The idea was to make sure that we had an exhibition of contemporary art set up at all times." [ 12 ] Educational programs [ edit ] Saturday art classes in the galleries of the Carnegie Museum of Art have been conducted for over 75 years. Alumni of the program include Andy Warhol , photographer Duane Michals , and contemporary artist Philip Pearlstein . [ citation needed ] The museum has classes specific to various age groups.

It was founded by Pittsburgh-based industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1896. 
Housing some 22 million specimens, the museum features one of the most extensive paleontological and entomological collections in the world. As seen from the 36th floor of the Cathedral of Learning . Description and history [ edit ] The museum consists of 115,000 square feet (10,700 m 2 ) organized into 20 galleries as well as research, library, and office space. It holds some 22 million specimens, of which about 10,000 are on view at any given time and about 1 million are cataloged in online databases. In 2008 it hosted 386,300 admissions and 63,000 school group visits. Museum education staff also actively engage in outreach by traveling to schools all around western Pennsylvania. The museum gained prominence in 1899 when its scientists unearthed the fossils of Diplodocus carnegii . [ 1 ] Notable dinosaur specimens include one of the world's very few fossils of a juvenile Apatosaurus , the world's first specimen of a Tyrannosaurus rex , [ 2 ] and a recently identified species of oviraptorosaur named Anzu wyliei . [ 3 ] Research teams including former Carnegie scientists made critical discoveries such as Puijila darwini , Castorocauda lutrasimilis , and Hadrocodium wui . Portion of the dinosaur exhibit. Fossil fish Fossil specimen of Anaethalion knorri from the Solnhofen limestone Mummies from the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt. Other major exhibits include Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems , Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians, Polar World: Wyckoff Hall of Arctic Life, Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, Benedum Hall of Geology, Dinosaurs in Their Time, and Powdermill Nature Reserve , established by the museum in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations. The museum's active curatorial departments are: Anthropology , Birds , Botany , Herpetology ( Amphibians & Reptiles ), Invertebrate Paleontology , Invertebrate Zoology , Mammals , Minerals , Mollusks ( Malacology ), and Vertebrate Paleontology . These departments work collaboratively under strategic centers created to re-frame how the museum leverages its research, exhibitions, and public programming to meet the challenges and issues of today. In late 2013, however, the museum's parent organization and interim administration eliminated multiple scientific positions, seriously reducing its capacity to conduct original research. Scientific publications [ edit ] Gift shop inside Carnegie Museum of Natural History Carnegie Museum of Natural History publishes scholarly journals and books including Annals of Carnegie Museum , which offers peer-reviewed articles in organismal biology, earth sciences, and anthropology; Bulletin of Carnegie Museum of Natural History , offering monographs or collections of related papers from symposia; and Special Publications of Carnegie Museum , documenting special topics or areas of research.

Kamin Science Center , [ 2 ] [ needs update ] is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . It is located in the Chateau [ 3 ] neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium . Overview [ edit ] The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Giant Theater (promoted as "the biggest screen in Pittsburgh"), a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University ’s Robot Hall of Fame (in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema), [ 5 ] SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and the USS Requin (a World War II submarine ). Updates [ edit ] According to Nicholas Efran, "The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years." However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are "Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building" [ 6 ] In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations . [ 7 ] In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 's Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the $10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs. [ 8 ] In June 2022, § Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame , such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars , Maria from Metropolis , as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey , were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the § SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid , the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center’s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage "until the Science Center decides what to do with it". [ 5 ] [ 9 ] History [ edit ] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades.  However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn ) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. [ 10 ] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991. [ 11 ] On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center [ 12 ] Roboworld (until 2022) [ edit ] Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022. [ 9 ] It was touted as "the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring "all things robotic". [ 13 ] Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid , the Robothespian, an interactive , animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort. [ 14 ] The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2 , C-3PO , Data , the T-800 Terminator , R.O.B. , Maschinenmensch , Gort , Robby the Robot , Robot B-9 , HAL 9000 , and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running . Highmark SportsWorks [ edit ] Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks ) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center.  It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. [ 15 ] The main idea of SportsWorks is "to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports." [ 15 ] SportsWorks features three themed areas:  Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports). The previous sponsor, UPMC , ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m 2 ) SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark .  It reopened in the Fall of 2009. [ 16 ] From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition .  At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit. [ 17 ] A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit , then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector , an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh. [ 18 ] E-motion cone [ edit ] The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system. [ 19 ] In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs. [ 20 ] At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.

Science museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Center for PostNatural History Front of the Museum in 2022 Wikimedia | © OpenStreetMap Location 4913 Penn Avenue Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15224 Coordinates 40°27′55″N 79°56′41″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.465357°N 79.944669°W ﻿ / 40.465357; -79.944669 Founder Richard Pell Nearest parking On street Website postnatural .org The Center for PostNatural History is a storefront museum in Pittsburgh's Garfield neighborhood. In contrast to typical natural history museums , it is focused on the collection and exposition of organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans by means including selective breeding or genetic engineering , [ 1 ] a phenomenon referred to as the postnatural . The Center is "dedicated to the advancement of knowledge relating to the complex interplay between culture, nature, and biotechnology", whose mission is "to acquire, interpret, and provide access to a collection of living, preserved, and documented organisms of postnatural origin". [ 1 ] Origins [ edit ] It was founded by Richard Pell, an associate professor of Electronic and Time-based Arts at Carnegie Mellon University . [ 2 ] Exhibits [ edit ] Displays have included GloFish (with fluorescence genes from sea coral), 'Biosteel' goats that grow spider silk proteins in their milk, [ 3 ] transgenic fruit flies and a Silkie chicken , bred through the continuation of a recessive gene for its fluffy, fur-like coat. Exhibits are narrated via wired telephone handset . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] A range of formats are used including photography, taxidermy and dioramas, and living exhibits. [ 5 ] In addition, the Center has an extensive online archive detailing past and current exhibitions, specimens, archives, events and press releases. Details of past exhibitions include notably those of the Cold Coast Archive, a collection of artefacts and seeds from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault collected by researchers and artists Signe Lidén, Annesofie Norn, and Steve Rowell which was displayed at the Center in 2012; [ 6 ] Atomic Age Rodents, an archive of rodents from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History which had been used in some form or another in atomic testing in the early to mid-20th Century; [ 7 ] and PostNatural Nature, produced in collaboration with the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin documenting different instances of the postnatural in everyday organisms. [ 8 ] Traveling exhibitions for museums and galleries are also produced. [ 2 ] Locations displayed at include the Waag Society in Amsterdam and the Art Laboratory in Berlin. [ 9 ] Design [ edit ] The Center employs a delicate and purposeful aesthetic to the display of their exhibits. It also intentionally uses neutral language so as to invite visitors to go beyond a reactionary impulse to stigma-blighted words, and instead consider the specimens and ideas on a deeper level. "The Center for Post Natural history does not offer a celebration of this technological harnessing of the immanence of life, nor is it a simple rejection. Instead it is a careful exploration of how lives might be lived together, asking what might be at stake for subjects, places, practices and politics". [ 10 ] In addition, the Center also produces a range of other paraphernalia pertaining to their collections and other conceptions of the postnatural. These include books, T-shirts and postcards, [ 11 ] and 3D archival prints which can be purchased on site. Recent news [ edit ] In 2015, the Center was featured by National Geographic in their March 2015 The Age of Disbelief issue. [ 12 ] References [ edit ] ^ Jump up to: a b "About" .

Children's museum in Pennsylvania, US Children's Museum of Pittsburgh City of Pittsburgh Historic Structure Pittsburgh Landmark – PHLF The original Children's Museum facility in the former Allegheny Post Office building Location 10 Children's Way, Allegheny Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , United States Coordinates 40°27′10″N 80°00′23″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.4529°N 80.0064°W ﻿ / 40.4529; -80.0064 CPHD designated December 26, 1972 [ 1 ] PHLF designated December 26, 1972 [ 2 ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh is a hands-on interactive children's museum in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It is in the Allegheny Center neighborhood in Pittsburgh's Northside . History [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh was founded in 1983 in the old Allegheny Post Office , gifted to the museum by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , and is situated on Pittsburgh's North Side, formerly Allegheny City . The neighboring Buhl Planetarium building was vacated by 1991 when it was superseded by the nearby Kamin Science Center .  The museum grew from a traveling mobile museum started at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in 1972, and was part of the first wave of children's museums spreading across the country at that time. [ 3 ] New building [ edit ] In the early 2000s, it was announced the museum would be expanding from the old Beaux Arts -style post office into the neighboring vacant Art Deco Buhl Planetarium.  A plan was devised by Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc. to connect the two historic structures with a modern glass addition over what was a street called Allegheny Square.  The street was vacated and realigned and the addition was built. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh became the largest Silver LEED certified museum in the country in March 2006. This validates that the museum's expansion has been designed and constructed using sustainable practices with particular attention to site development, water conservation, energy management, using recycled materials, waste management, reusing resources, indoor air quality as well as developing new programs for visitors. To offer teaching moments about the new green museum , many of the building's structural and mechanical systems are left exposed. Buhl Community Park [ edit ] In 2010, officials announced plans to rehab a rundown park in front of the museum. The centerpiece of the new park will be a fog sculpture by Ned Kahn . The park opened on June 23, 2012, during a community celebration. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Grounds [ edit ] In its seasonal "Backyard", [ 6 ] the museum grounds includes an interactive environment called "Allegheny Waterworks" which incorporates preserved local architectural relics. [ 7 ] A garden on the grounds once displayed sculptures of Guyasuta , Christopher Gist and others, designed by sculptor Charles Keck and rescued from the Manchester Bridge when it was razed in 1970. The garden was removed in the 2000s to make room for more parking. The Guyasuta and Gist sculptures have been reinstalled near Stage AE in the North Shore neighborhood. [ 8 ] Exhibits [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh houses several ongoing exhibits as well as rotating exhibits.   The MAKESHOP, Kindness Gallery, Studio, Backyard, Garage, Garden, Theater, Waterplay, and Nursery areas are ongoing interactive exhibits and encourage touch and play. [ 9 ] Also located within the museum are iconic items from the show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . These include the original puppets, one of Fred Rogers ' sweaters, and his sneakers. [ 10 ] Programs [ edit ] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh presents a wide variety of programs for children in fields ranging from dance and rocket building to quilting and robotics. Visiting artists offer workshops in a host of media, including pottery, Japanese paper cutting, animation and painting. The museum's extensive outreach program offers performances, workshops, after school programs, artist days and festival programs for schools and groups throughout the year. Educational field trips are offered for local schools, scouts and other groups. The museum has collaborated with a number of regional institutions and programs, such as the University of Pittsburgh and the Create a Comic Project . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Awards [ edit ] The former Buhl Planetarium building is now part of the Children's Museum The addition has received numerous awards, including a 2009 National Medal for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services , National Trust for Historic Preservation award, LEED silver certification, and an award from American Institute of Architects. Children's Museum Executive Director Jane Werner received the Green Building Alliance [ 13 ] 2006 Shades of Green Leadership Award which celebrates leaders who have helped transform the Pittsburgh region into a more sustainable place to live and work. Werner's contributions cited include launching a new program/initiative supporting green-building related activities; raising significant community awareness and outreach of green issues through materials, programs and events; and influencing the adoption of a program/policy through advocacy efforts and implementing green management and operation policies within the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh.

Salk Hall from the rear Jonas Salk Hall at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pennsylvania state [ 2 ] and Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark. [ 3 ] The Art Deco building is named after Jonas Salk , who conducted his research on the first polio vaccine in a basement laboratory while on the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh . [ 4 ] Jonas Salk in 1955 holds bottles of a culture used to grow polio vaccines History [ edit ] The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city owned Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city.  It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz. [ 5 ] The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration . [ 6 ] The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city.  Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt's School of Public Health . [ 7 ] In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($14.6 million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall.  For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students.  Pitt remodeled it to house the School of Dental Medicine and School of Pharmacy in 1961-1962. [ 8 ] Annex [ edit ] The Salk Hall Annex, a major renovation and three-story addition designed by the architectural firm Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel [ 9 ] for the Dental School, was completed the Terrace Street side of the building in 1967 [ 10 ] for a cost of over $5 million ($49.9 million today). [ 11 ] Today, it serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and the dental clinics. A new $50.6 million ($73 million today) addition and renovation to Salk Hall was announced in January 2010. [ 12 ] It will include the construction of an 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m 2 ) research tower in the parking area behind the existing building by Ballinger Architects with associates DRS Architects. The new tower is planned to house laboratories and support spaces relocated from their current home in Salk Hall in order to free up space for additional classrooms and offices in the original structure. [ 13 ] The target completion date is July, 2014. Dental Museum [ edit ] A dental museum is housed in the first floor reception area of Salk Hall. The museum contains a variety of original dental artifacts, including a c. 1910 dental chair, and x-ray machine and instrument cabinet from the 1920s. [ 14 ] Pharmacy Museum [ edit ] Also contained in Salk Hall is the Elmer H. Grimm Sr. Pharmacy Museum, [ 15 ] which opened in the fall of 1996.  Located on the fourth floor, the museum holds pharmacy memorabilia such as drug products, equipment, and sundry products dating back to the early 20th century.  Among the museum's possessions are two hand-carved finials , which were often found over the door or partitions that separated the main part of the pharmacy from the back room where pharmacists did most of their work, an old-fashioned powder mill , and a konseal machine.

It is at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers , where the Ohio River is formed. Fort Pitt Museum is surrounded by Point State Park , a Pennsylvania state park named for the geographically and historically significant point that is between the rivers. This piece of land was key to controlling the upper reaches of the Ohio River Valley and western Pennsylvania, before, during and after the French and Indian War as well as the American Revolution . The museum is in a recreated bastion of Fort Pitt , which was originally built in 1758 by the British. An outline of Fort Duquesne is nearby. The historical focus of the museum is the role that Fort Pitt played during the French and Indian War. The museum also features detailed information on Fort Pitt's role during the American Revolution, the Whiskey Rebellion and the founding of Pittsburgh. The museum was established and operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until its closure in August 2009 from state budget cuts. The Heinz Center took over the operation of the museum and reopened it in April 2010. History [ edit ] Main article: Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania) Fort Pitt was a fort in what is now the city of Pittsburgh , Allegheny County, Pennsylvania . The fort was built in 1758 during the French and Indian War , next to the site of Fort Duquesne . The French built Fort Duquesne at the beginning of that war, and it became a focal point due to its strategic river location. The Braddock expedition , a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with a bloody repulse at the Monongahela River . The French garrison viciously mauled an attacking British regiment in September 1758, but abandoned and destroyed the fort at the approach of General John Forbes 's expedition in November. The Forbes expedition was successful where the Braddock expedition had failed because of the Treaty of Easton , in which area American Indians agreed to abandon their alliance with the French. American Indians— primarily Delawares and Shawnees — made this agreement with the understanding that the British military would leave the area after the war. The Indians wanted a trading post on the spot, but they did not want a British army garrison. The British, however, built a new fort on the site and named it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt the Elder . "A Plan of the New Fort at Pitts-Burgh", drawn by cartographer John Rocque and published in 1765. "Fort Pitt in 1795", from Durant's 1876 "History of Allegheny County" The Blockhouse . Part of the excavated fort. As a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees took part in Pontiac's Rebellion , an effort to drive the British out of their territory. The Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, the commander of Fort Pitt gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox, in hopes of infecting the surrounding Indians and ending the siege. The effectiveness of this attempt is unclear. Outbreaks of smallpox had plagued Native Americans for years before, during and after the Fort Pitt attempt, killing much of the Native American population. On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege in order to intercept an approaching force under Colonel Henry Bouquet , resulting in the Battle of Bushy Run . Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10. After Pontiac's War, Fort Pitt was no longer necessary to the British Crown and was abandoned to the locals in 1772. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore . The fort served as a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774. During the American Revolutionary War , Fort Pitt served as a headquarters for the western theatre of the war. Fort Pitt fell into disrepair once again in the years following the Revolution. It was abandoned in 1792 when Fort Fayette was built to replace it. Residents of the growing Pittsburgh used the remnants of the fort to build permanent housing for themselves. A small brick building called the Blockhouse —actually a type of outbuilding known as a redoubt —remains in Point State Park , the only intact remnant of Fort Pitt. It was erected in 1764 and is believed to be the oldest building, not only in Pittsburgh but in western Pennsylvania. Used for many years as a home, the blockhouse was purchased and has been preserved for many years by the Daughters of the American Revolution , who make it open to the public. Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum. Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing centre for the Federal government during the Civil War , under the charge of William Metcalf . Museum [ edit ] Main article: Point State Park Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources , announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination. Plans for improving the park are well underway.  They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs.  Currently (April 2011) the waterfront area is closed to pedestrians as the stone walkways and wharf area are being resurfaced.  They are to be reopened during the summer, 2011. [ 2 ] These plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, thirteen members of two different locals labour unions were arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The labour union protested the use of four non-labour workers by the contractor responsible for completing the work at Point State Park. [1] On August 14, 2009, the state closed the museum and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Management of the museum is supposed to be taken over by Senator John Heinz Regional History Center once the state budget is passed. [ 3 ] The Senator John Heinz History Center reopened the Fort Pitt Museum on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The History Center's museum system also includes a Smithsonian-affiliated, seven-story museum in Pittsburgh's Strip District;  Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America located in Avella, Pa.; and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, a two-floor museum-within-a-museum at the History Center. [ 4 ] Currently, the Fort Pitt Museum is open to visitation seven days a week from 10am - 5pm.  The museum is closed only on major holidays (Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving and Easter) [ 5 ] References [ edit ] Notes ^ "National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Pittsburgh Renaissance Historic District" (PDF) .

It focuses on the interpretation of the life and times of Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919), industrialist and art collector. The complex, located on 5.5 acres (22,000 m 2 ) [ 1 ] of lawn and gardens in the city's Point Breeze neighborhood, includes Clayton, the restored Frick mansion; The Frick Art Museum; The Car and Carriage Museum; the Greenhouse; the Frick children's playhouse ; and The Café. The site welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year. Admission is free. Helen Clay Frick (1888–1984) was the driving force to preserve the Frick estate and allow it to open to the public after her death. History [ edit ] The Frick Mansion "Clayton" Today's museum began as an eleven-room, Italianate-style house purchased by the Fricks shortly after their marriage in 1881.  The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown.  After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed "Clayton".  Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architect Frederick J. Osterling .  The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architects Alden & Harlow . The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905.  The Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, where they eventually established the Frick Collection , but in 1981 daughter Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton, where she had previously spent part of each year, and remained there permanently until her death in 1984. Clayton opened to the public in 1990, and in 1997 the 1950s carriage house was enlarged to create the Car and Carriage Museum. [ citation needed ] In May 2013 the center announced a $15 million renovation to break ground on June 6, 2013. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The renovation was completed in 2015; the Car and Carriage Museum was expanded to twice its original size, and a community center and education center were built.

Named after U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III (1938–1991) from Pennsylvania, it is located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh . The Heinz History Center is a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m 2 ) [ 2 ] educational institution "that engages and inspires a diverse audience with links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection." [ 3 ] In 2024, the Heinz History Center was named the best history museum in the United States by readers of USA Today as part of their annual Readers' Choice poll. [ 4 ] Senator John Heinz History Center [ edit ] The Heinz History Center seen from the Strip District in Pittsburgh in July 2007 In 1879, a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania was founded. In 1884, leaders changed the organization's name to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania (HSWP); it has been operating continuously since then and is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization. [ 3 ] HSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of steamboat navigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955, it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. During its early years, HSWP leaders held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, were granted space for the organization's archives at the new Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood. [ 3 ] By 1914, HSWP had its own building on Bigelow Boulevard. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip District . [ 3 ] The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by hosting an inaugural gala there on April 26, 1996, for 900 guests. [ citation needed ] In 2004, the Smithsonian wing was completed, adding a gallery for changing exhibitions from the Smithsonian Institution , a Special Collections Gallery, an Education Center, and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum. [ 5 ] The History Center is named for John Heinz , a former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash. [ 2 ] Architecture [ edit ] The century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted by the Pittsburgh office of the architecture firm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson , who did the design and oversaw construction. The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is an exhibit in its own right. [ 6 ] Interior and contents [ edit ] The History Center features the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Detre Library & Archives, and six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania. [ 7 ] The History Center features permanent exhibitions including: Pittsburgh: A Tradition of Innovation - celebrates 250 years of Western Pennsylvania's significant contributions to the world, from Dr. Jonas Salk 's discovery of the polio vaccine to the invention of the Big Mac .

[ 11 ] Rediscovering Lewis & Clark: A Journey with the Rooney Family - traces the path of Lewis and Clark's expedition beginning in Pittsburgh. [ 12 ] Glass: Shattering Notions - showcases Pittsburgh's reign as America's "glass city" and the history of the region’s first industry. [ 13 ] Heinz - chronicles the history of the H.J. Heinz Company. [ 14 ] Visible Storage - provides a behind-the-scenes look at more than 1,200 objects in the museum's collection. [ 15 ] Special Collections Gallery - houses artifacts illustrating the rich ethnic history and corporate fabric of the Pittsburgh region. [ 16 ] The gallery also features original set pieces and props from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood , which was filmed in Pittsburgh. [ 17 ] Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the History Center [ edit ] Located in the Smithsonian wing of the Senator John Heinz History Center, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum spans 20,000 square feet (1,900 m 2 ) of exhibit space over two floors. The "museum within a museum" captures the Pittsburgh region's evolution and influence as a sports leader over more than a century, from amateur to pro and across the spectrum of sports. The Sports Museum captures tales of Pittsburgh sports through hundreds of artifacts, more than 70 hands-on interactive exhibits, and 20 audio-visual programs. Select artifacts include Franco Harris ' " Immaculate Reception " cleats; Mario Lemieux 's hockey skates; Satchel Paige 's baseball glove; the pitching rubber from the 1960 World Series; Billy Conn 's boxing gloves and light heavyweight champion belt; Arnold Palmer 's sweater and golf bag; Chip Ganassi 's 2000 Indy 500-winning race car; the "Ultimate Steelers Fan's Car;" the Homestead women swimmers Olympic medals from the 1920s and 1930s; and hundreds of Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cards . Detre Library & Archives at the History Center [ edit ] The History Center's Detre Library & Archives is an extensive scholarly resource documenting 250 years of life in Western Pennsylvania. The collection includes books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, atlases, newspapers, films, recordings, and other memorabilia. [ 18 ] Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village [ edit ] Main article: Meadowcroft Rockshelter The History Center also operates Meadowcroft Rockshelter , a world-renowned archaeological site south of Pittsburgh near Washington County 's Avella community. The Rockshelter is the oldest site of human habitation in North America, with evidence of humans living there for nearly 19,000 years. [ 19 ] The site was named a National Historic Landmark in 2005. [ 20 ] The site also includes a recreated 16th century Monongahela Indian Village and 1770s Frontier Trading Post. [ 21 ] Adjacent to the Rockshelter is a historic village featuring 19th century structures relocated to the site. The History Center operates this as a living museum, with re-enactors recreating rural life in the 19th century Upper Ohio Valley. [ 22 ] Fort Pitt Museum [ edit ] Main article: Fort Pitt Museum Since 2010, the History Center has operated the Fort Pitt Museum , a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m 2 ) museum located at Point State Park .

Founded in 1794, it houses one of the largest theological libraries in the tri-state area . History [ edit ] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary was formed in 1959 by consolidating the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. 's Western Theological Seminary and the United Presbyterian Church of North America 's Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary . The consolidation was the result of the 1958 merger between the PCUSA and the UPCNA to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary began with the founding of Service Seminary (Associate Theological Seminary in the town of Service, Beaver County, Pennsylvania ) in 1792 by the Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania. Prior to that time, the Presbytery was dependent on a supply of ministers sent from Scotland . John Anderson was elected as the first teacher of divinity and the school began with an enrollment of six students. Service Seminary moved several times, from Service to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania , then to Xenia, Ohio , where it became Xenia Theological Seminary . This occurred in the 1850s and was prompted by a desire to locate nearer to the growing population in the Midwest . Joseph Kyle joined the faculty in 1900 (leaving 4th United Presbyterian Church in Allegheny, Pennsylvania ). In approximately 1914, Kyle was appointed president. In 1920, the trustees determined to move the seminary to St. Louis, Missouri , also to be nearer to potential students in the Plains states. In 1921, Kyle died unexpectedly. This loss of leadership at a crucial transition period created problems for the fledgling institution and it never really took root. In 1930, Xenia merged with a seminary that was founded in Pittsburgh in 1825, which was known as Pittsburgh Seminary (1825–1833; 1913–1930) and Allegheny Seminary (1833–1912). [ 1 ] Together Pittsburgh and Xenia formed the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. This institution was later augmented by the resources of Newburgh Seminary , founded in New York City in 1805 by John Mitchell Mason . Western Theological Seminary, the other branch of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's pre-1959 history, began with the establishment of classical academies in Washington, Pennsylvania , the first in 1785 by Joseph Smith and another in 1787 by John McMillan. Out of these academies, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA created Western Seminary. It was indeed a western seminary in 1825, furnishing a ministry for the rapidly opening frontier territories along the Ohio River. [ 2 ] Since the 1959 consolidation, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary has been located on the former Pittsburgh-Xenia Seminary campus in the Highland Park/East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. It became a PC (USA) seminary following the 1983 merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States . Academics [ edit ] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education . The seminary has scholars in all major fields of theological inquiry and offers language training in Greek and Hebrew. The following degrees are offered by the institution: [ 3 ] Master of Divinity (M.Div.) Master of Arts in Pastoral Studies (M.A.P.S.) Master of Theological Studies (MTS) Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) Focus areas include Science and Theology, Missional Leadership, Reformed, Christian Spirituality, Intergenerational Black Church Studies, Eastern Christian, and Creative Writing & Public Theology. [ 4 ] The Seminary also cooperates with other institutions within the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education to offer joint degree programs, including: Master of Divinity/ Juris Doctor ( Duquesne University ) M.A.P.S./Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) MTS/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) Master of Divinity/ Master of Social Work ( University of Pittsburgh ) Clifford E. Barbour Library [ edit ] The Clifford E. Barbour Library [ 5 ] is a theological library in Western Pennsylvania. Its 300,000 volumes, several online databases, and more than 800 periodical subscriptions make it one of the larger stand-alone theological libraries in the United States. [ 6 ] The library is located in a three-story building of American Colonial design, dedicated in 1964. The library houses several valuable collections, including the John M. Mason Memorial Collection, which consists of many rare theological works dating from the Reformation. On display in the Hansen Reading Room are the desk and chair of Karl Barth , dedicated to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary by Barth's son, Markus Barth , a faculty member from 1963–1972. [ 7 ] Many of the books and periodicals in the collection were made possible by a $15 million gift from wealthy banker and businessman Thomas Clinton . The library was managed by Dikran Hadidian during its formative years. Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology [ edit ] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is home to the Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The museum contains a collection of ancient Near Eastern and Palestinian pottery and artifacts brought together by travelers and archeologists over the past 60 years. Many exhibits resulted from the eight excavations of which the seminary has been a part. The Seminary is very involved in Biblical archaeology , and sponsors the Zeitah Excavations in Israel at Tel Zayit . [ 8 ] The excavation was founded under the direction of Professor Ron E. Tappy, Professor of Bible and Archaeology and director of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The excavation began in 1999 with a 55-member international team of experts and volunteers. In July 2005 excavators discovered the Zayit Stone , which contained an inscription dating to the 10th century BCE (King Solomon's reign). The two-line inscription, on a 33-pound limestone boulder embedded in the stone wall of a building, is the earliest securely-dated example of the complete Hebrew alphabet (an "abecedary"). The letters show a transitional script emerging from Phoenician and leading to the Hebrew national script of the 9th century BCE. The first significant inscription from this period in nearly a century, the discovery was reported in the New York Times . World Mission Initiative [ edit ] World Mission Initiative (WMI) at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is a fellowship of Presbyterians. [ 9 ] WMI prepares seminarians to become pastors, and coordinates cross-cultural trips. It has a church focus and works to train world Christian pastors. WMI hosts missionaries, national church leaders, and scholars on campus throughout the year. Faculty and alumni [ edit ] Prominent faculty from the seminary's history include: Dale Allison M. Craig Barnes Robert A. J. Gagnon John Gerstner Archibald Alexander Hodge William Swan Plumer Andrew Purves Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield Robert Dick Wilson Prominent alumni include: Thomas K. Chadwick John A. Dalles Festo Kivengere , sometimes referred to as "the Billy Graham of Africa", a Ugandan Anglican Bishop of Kigezi, evangelist, and fierce critic of Idi Amin's excesses.

Allegheny Theological Seminary (1833–1912) was formerly known at Pittsburgh Seminary (1825–1833). In 1913, the seminary name changed again to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary of the United Presbyterian Church of North America to reflect the incorporation of the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh in 1912. It then [1930] merged with Xenia Seminary of Ohio and Missouri to become the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. ^ "History" . www.pts.edu .

Contemporary art museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Mattress Factory The Mattress Factory Location of the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh Established 1977 Location Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Coordinates 40°27′26″N 80°00′44″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.4571477°N 80.012187°W ﻿ / 40.4571477; -80.012187 Visitors 28,000 (2018) [ 1 ] Founder Barbara Luderowski Director David Oresick [ 2 ] Nearest parking On site, Street Website mattress .org The Mattress Factory is a contemporary art museum located in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It was a pioneer of site-specific installation art and features permanent installations by artists Yayoi Kusama , [ 3 ] James Turrell , [ 4 ] and Greer Lankton . [ 5 ] The museum's roof itself is a light art installation and part of Pittsburgh's Northside evening skyline. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Barbara Luderowski purchased a derelict Stearns & Foster mattress warehouse in 1975. The museum achieved non-profit status in 1977. [ 8 ] Over the next forty years, Luderowski would attract upcoming installation artists to fill its rooms. The Mattress Factory along with its neighbors City of Asylum and Randyland are credited with playing a role in Pittsburgh's revitalization. [ 9 ] History [ edit ] In 1975, artist and Mattress Factory founder Barbara Luderowski purchased a former Stearns & Foster mattress warehouse at 500 Sampsonia Way in Pittsburgh's Central Northside . Originally, she used the warehouse as a space to live, work and build a community of artists and intellectuals. The community grew and in 1977—after two years of hosting art exhibits and a small food co-op—the Mattress Factory was established as a legal non-profit educational and cultural corporation. Its first exhibition of installation art opened five years later on May 8, 1982, and the museum has since grown to be an integral part of the Pittsburgh arts community, known for its artist residency program, educational programming, and unique exhibitions. In 2008 then-Curator of Exhibitions Michael Olijnyk joined Luderowski in leading the museum as co-director. Over the years the Mattress Factory has acquired more properties for various purposes, including: 1414 Monterey Street, which became a new gallery space Two buildings on North Taylor Street that became artist residences 505 Jacksonia Street, which is now used as a parking lot for museum visitors, and the adjacent lot, which now houses Winifred Lutz's Garden Installation , 1993 516 Sampsonia Way, which opened as gallery space in Fall 2013 Sexual Misconduct Allegations [ edit ] In September 2018, a report published in Pittsburgh's WESA detailed five employees' allegations of sexual misconduct and the mishandling of the situation by the Mattress Factory and its director, Michael Olijnyk. [ 10 ] The complaint was filed with the National Labor Relations Board, and in early January 2019, a settlement was reached and the investigation was closed. [ 11 ] Long-term exhibitions [ edit ] As of 2024 [update] , the Mattress Factory hosts 20 long-term installations.

Diorama of western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: "Miniature Railroad & Village" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A shot of the one section of the MRRV display. The Miniature Railroad & Village (MRRV) is a large and detailed model train layouts diorama of western Pennsylvania from 1880 to 1930. It is a long-running display currently located in the Kamin Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , the MRRV has been a Pittsburgh tradition for over 50 years. History [ edit ] A model of the Bowdish Homestead, since demolished, on the MRRV platform. The exhibit was initiated by Charles Bowdish  (1896–1988) of Brookville, Pennsylvania . Bowdish was a soldier during World War I .  When doctors discovered a congenital heart problem, he was honorably discharged from service and sent home, where he began to build models of structures around Brookville, his hometown.  Every Christmas, in his home on Creek Street (the house has since been demolished), the buildings were assembled in a display, complete with Lionel trains running through it.  On Christmas Eve 1920, Charles hosted his brother's wedding and reception, and entertained the guests by running his train display.  One of the guests, Alfred Truman , asked if he could bring some friends over to see it—word quickly spread, and nearly 600 people showed up. Because of this, Christmas Eve 1920 is considered to be the birth date of the exhibit. Bowdish soon began setting up and exhibiting his railroad yearly at Christmas time in his house.  Each year there would be a different theme, such as White Christmas or Indian Summer . The railroad spanned the entire second floor, and no admission fee was ever charged.  Thousands of people saw it over the years, some coming from other countries. A combination of a flood nearly destroying his stored models, and his insurance company refusing to cover the crowds anymore, forced Charles to begin searching for a new home for his work.  He originally offered it to Brookville, but the town declined. Eventually he offered it to the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science in Pittsburgh (renamed Buhl Science Center in the 1970s). The Buhl offered him space, and the exhibit opened there on December 1, 1954, and ran until December 31.  During the 31-day period, figures showed that 23,885 visitors viewed the layout. It was originally 14' X 14', and was called The Great Christmastown Railroad . It was renamed The Miniature Railroad & Village in 1957. The exhibit was an instant hit, and was and still is one of the major holiday attractions in Pittsburgh. The MRRV was in the basement, and the queue would at times extend out the front door and around the block, and the wait would be four hours long. Eventually the dates it was open would be the first weekend of November to the last weekend of February. It was then torn down and stored until the next year because the space had to be used for the annual science fair . On January 1, 1987, the Buhl officially became a part of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh . The Buhl staff had been wanting to expand the science center so they could bring in large travelling exhibits, and create more of their own. Joining the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh allowed them to have the resources to do it. Buhl closed on August 31, 1991, and Kamin Science Center opened on October 5, 1991. A whole new building allowed the museum to dedicate a room just to the MRRV. The new and expanded Miniature Railroad & Village opened in the Fall of 1992. Present [ edit ] The replica of the Sharon Steel Mill. The current platform is 83 feet (25 m) long by 30 feet (9.1 m) wide, 60% larger than the original.  Five independent loops feature Lionel trains, and one Bowser trolley travels through the town; these lines operate continuously. The new display's philosophy was the historic and educational significance of Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas; this permitted the display to be considered a large, animated history book.  Scenes on the display depict how people worked, lived, and played during the years 1880–1930.  These years cover part of the American Industrial Revolution , the Victorian and Edwardian eras, the Gilded Age (as Mark Twain called it), World War I, the Roaring 20s , and the beginning of the Great Depression .  All of the models featured on the display are handcrafted by staff, both paid and volunteers, and replicate real structures from around Western Pennsylvania .  The display boasts the largest steel mill ever replicated in O scale : the Sharon Steel Mill from Farrell, PA , which was constructed from the mill's actual blueprints. Expert advisors were contracted to make the new display as lifelike as possible. For example, a Harvard professor designed the lighting system to resemble the movement of the Sun and actual daylight . A sophisticated computer system controls the layout. Opto 22 , a company which supplies NASA and Disney World with control modules, provided the system. Every year, two months before Thanksgiving , the display closes down for maintenance .  During this shutdown period, new models are installed, and sometimes new animations are installed, which were constructed earlier in the year, for exhibition on the display. Occasionally old models are installed as well. Scenes on the display are updated, and the layout is given a careful and thorough cleaning. The exhibit reopens the day after Thanksgiving. Collectible Boxcars [ edit ] Since 1999, Lionel has issued collectable boxcars and a caboose as part of the commemorative MRRV series.  Each year, the boxcar features a unique design, drawn up inhouse.  These limited edition cars are only available through the Kamin Science Center's XPLOR Store.  Additionally, Lionel produced a Sub car for the Kamin Science Center in 2002 as part of the LCCA Pittsburgh Convention.

The Nationality Rooms are a group of 31 classrooms in the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning depicting and donated by the national and ethnic groups that helped build the city of Pittsburgh . The rooms are designated as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation historical landmark and are located on the 1st and 3rd floors of the Cathedral of Learning, itself a national historic landmark, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] on the University of Pittsburgh 's main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , United States. Although of museum caliber, 29 of the 31 rooms are used as daily classrooms by University of Pittsburgh faculty and students, while the other two (the Early American and Syrian-Lebanon) are display rooms viewed through glass doors, utilized primarily for special events, and can only be explored via special guided tour. The Nationality Rooms also serve in a vigorous program of intercultural involvement and exchange in which the original organizing committees for the rooms remain as participants and which includes a program of annual student scholarship to facilitate study abroad. [ 6 ] In addition, the Nationality Rooms inspire lectures, seminars, concerts exhibitions, and social events which focus on the various heritages and traditions of the nations represented. The national, traditional, and religious holidays of the nations represented are celebrated on campus and the rooms are appropriately decorated to reflect these occasions. The Nationality Rooms are available daily for public tours as long as the particular room is not being used for a class or other university function. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The Nationality Room Program was founded by Ruth Crawford Mitchell at the request of Pitt Chancellor John Bowman in 1926, in order to involve the community in constructing the Cathedral of Learning and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to national communities in the Pittsburgh area to sponsor a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group formed a Room Committee responsible for fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, "...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms." [ 8 ] Each room is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates, door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials.  Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the cathedral.  A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965 when E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion of twelve additional rooms on the third floor. Bruhns retired on Jan. 1, 2020, after 54 years in the position, and died in July 2020. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The Nationality Rooms Information, tours, and gift shop center just off the Commons Room A typical room on the 1st floor built between 1938 and 1957 took between three and ten years to complete, and would have cost the equivalent of $467,927 today, which was no small undertaking, especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during the Great Depression and World War II .  More recent rooms have cost in the range of US$750,000 and up, and took up to ten years to complete. [ 11 ] Upon completion of their rooms, the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad.  The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events, lectures, concerts, exhibits, social events, and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms.  The committee may use its room for non-political meetings, lectures, or other functions if no classes are scheduled. Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees, and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for the University libraries , publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes, and the fostering of courses in the mother languages.  National, traditional, and religious holidays are celebrated on campus, and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions. The first four rooms to be dedicated were the Scottish , Russian , German , and Swedish Rooms in 1938." [ 12 ] The newest rooms are the Turkish and Swiss rooms, both dedicated in 2012, [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the Korean room dedicated in 2015, [ 15 ] and the Philippine Room dedicated in 2019. [ 16 ] Original plans also proposed, in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor, the creation of " Pennsylvania " classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor "Pittsburgh" classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of the Western Pennsylvania or different eras of American history. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up, only one room was installed, the Early American Classroom, which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms. The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed, and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor. The English Classroom, the largest of the 31 Nationality Rooms, contains several artifacts from the original second House of Commons Upon completion of a room, a dedication ceremony is held with a formal presentation of a ceremonial key to the university's Chancellor to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift, and a commitment by the university to maintain the room in perpetuity. The nationality room committee officers then become members of the Nationality Council which provides scholarships for summer study abroad for Pitt students, along with other non-political cultural or educational events within the Nationality Program's scope. Today, [ as of? ] the cathedral is home to 31 Nationality Rooms (29 working classrooms and two display rooms: the Early American Room and the Syrian-Lebanon Room), on the first and third floors. Each nationality room celebrates a different culture that influenced Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to 1787, the university's founding and the signing of the United States Constitution . Only one room does not follow this convention, with the French Classroom depicting the First French Empire of the early 19th century. There are two additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded. [ citation needed ] Set in the Cathedral of Learning's cornerstone in 1937 is a gift from the Nationality Room Committee chairpersons to the university: a copper plate engraved with these thoughts: Faith and peace are in their hearts. Good will has brought them together. Like the Magi of ancestral traditions and the shepherds of candid simplicity, they offer their gifts of what is precious, genuine and their own, to truth that shines forever and enlightens all people. [ 8 ] Since 1944, tours of the nationality rooms have been given to visitors by a Pitt student organization, Quo Vadis (Latin: Where do you go? ), that guides over 40,000 tourists a year. With reservations, specially themed tours based on creature symbolism, images of royalty, and folktales are also given. An estimated 100,000 visitors, including self-guided and walk-in tourists, visit the Nationality Rooms each year. Principles [ edit ] The Indian Classroom, opened in 2000, is one of the newer Nationality Rooms that continue to be installed on the third floor The following principles, in order to assure commonality of purpose, authenticity, and non-political cultural emphasis, governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957. A Nationality Room must illustrate one of the outstanding architectural or design traditions of a nation that is recognized as such by the United States Department of State . The design of a given historical period must be cultural and aesthetic, not political.  The period depicted should be prior to 1787, the year the university was founded. To avoid political implications in the room, no political symbol is permitted in the decorations, nor a portrait or likeness of any living person. The only place a political symbol may be used is in the corridor stone above the room's entrance. No donor recognition may appear in the rooms. Donor recognition to the rooms is recorded in a Donor Book. Most architects and designers of the rooms have been born and educated abroad.  This has been instrumental in ensuring authenticity of design. In the 1970s, policy revisions were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles, utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life.  This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of the Soviet Union , as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room. The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tablet-armed seats, professor's lectern or table, adequate sight lines and lighting, modern audiovisual technology, and other necessities of a classroom.  New rooms also have narrated tour equipment. Materials are to remain authentic and durable that are executed through architectural form and not mere surface embellishment and are to provide eternal qualities that have the potential to "teach" about the cultures with appropriate non-political symbols and artifacts. Classrooms [ edit ] African Heritage [ edit ] The African Heritage Classroom African Heritage Classroom Location Room 330 Dedicated December 17, 1989 Concept Dr. Laurence Glasco Style 18th century Asante Temple Architect William J. Bates, A.I.A. The African Heritage Classroom was designed to reflect an 18th-century Asante temple courtyard in Ghana which would provide the setting for ceremonial events, learning, and worship.  The classroom represents the entire continent of Africa with Yoruba -style door carvings by Nigerian sculptor Lamidi O. Fakeye depicting ancient kingdoms of Africa including Egypt , Nubia , Ethiopia , Benin , Kongo / Angola , Kuba , Mali , and Zimbabwe . Plaster forms in the frieze represent the arts, music, science, languages, and literature of Africa. A display case housing artifacts from various African nations and the chalkboard area reflect patos around the courtyard. Below the chalkboard doors depicting the Igbo lozenge and star motif are Sankofa birds which symbolize the need to learn from the past in order to prepare for the future.  The oxblood steps, two levels of student benches, and wainscot with relief decorations suggest the polished clay of an Asante temple.  Openwork screens are present on the windows as they are used in Asante structures to filter the sun's rays while allowing air flow.  Six chieftain stools provide informal seating near a hand-carved professor's lectern. Armenian [ edit ] The Armenian Classroom Armenian Classroom Location Room 319 Dedicated August 28, 1988 Style 10th–12th century Monastic Architect Torkom Khrimian The Armenian Classroom [ 19 ] was inspired by the 10th- to 12th-century Sanahin Monastery . The design consists of intersecting arches and a domed ceiling built to lessen damage from frequent earthquakes in that country. The room's arches, built of Indiana limestone, make this the heaviest of the Nationality Rooms, weighing 22 tons, and required the second floor beneath the room to be reinforced in order to support its weight. The cornerstone is a basalt stone from the grounds of Sanahin. In the mortar behind it are the thumbprints of five of the oldest Armenian diaspora living in the Pittsburgh area, as well as the handprint of an infant of Armenian descent, symbolizing the continuity of the Armenian presence in western Pennsylvania. Austrian [ edit ] The Austrian Classroom Austrian Classroom Location Room 314 Dedicated June 9, 1996 Style 17th–18th century Baroque Architects Franz Gerhardt Schnögass, Vienna Gunther J. Kaier, A.I.A. Pittsburgh The Austrian Nationality Room represents the 18th-century era of the Austrian Empire during its age of enlightenment under Empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II and incorporates Baroque elements of the Haydnsaal in Schloss Esterházy at Eisenstadt where Joseph Haydn served as Kapellmeister from 1766 to 1778.  Ceiling paintings depict scenes from Roman mythology similar to those in the Haydnsaal.  The room features Lobmeyer crystal chandeliers, gilded white lacquer seminar furniture patterned after that in the formal dining hall of Vienna's Hofburg , royal red-tapestried walls, gold-leafed pilasters , and a parquet floor inlaid in a starburst design. Exhibits in the display cases in the room trace the development of the multinational Austrian Empire and the birthplaces of representative Austrian composers born within its borders between the years 1000 and 1918. Chinese [ edit ] The Chinese Classroom Chinese Classroom Location Room 136 Dedicated October 6, 1939 Style 18th-century Chinese Empire Designer Teng Kwei, Beijing Architect Henry Killiam Murphy The Chinese Classroom is inspired by the design of a palace hall in Beijing's Forbidden City and is dedicated to the memory of Confucius and his democratic ideal of classless education. The teacher and students sit at the same level around a moon-shaped teakwood table.  The professor's chair is carved with the admonition to "Teach by inspiring gradually and steadily". A slate portrait of Confucius is present that is patterned after one in the Confucian temple at his birthplace of Qufu in Shandong Province .  Above the red lacquered door, Chinese characters are carved into the stone lintel that proclaim that "Humility of mind goes with loftiness of character." Stone lions flank the entrance before carvings of the plum blossom, the national flower of China. The ceiling contains a coiling golden five-clawed imperial dragon surrounded by clouds denoting nature's energy and freedom.  Painted squares portray dragons guarding the pearl of wisdom and the phoenix with the motan flower, a symbol of cultural wealth.  The opened blackboard doors reveal painted renditions of the babao, or Eight Treasures , popular in Chinese art .  On the base below is a carved version of the Bagua which consists of eight trigrams surrounding the circular Yin and Yang .  Windows consist of frosted glass with stylized cames . Czechoslovak [ edit ] The Czechoslovak Classroom Czechoslovak Classroom Location Room 113 Dedicated March 7, 1939 Style Folk Motif Architect Dr. Bohumil Sláma, Prague The Czechoslovak Classroom combines elements of a Slovak farmhouse, country church, and the Charles University in Prague while detailing men who contributed to Czechoslovak culture. The motto of the classroom, and of the former Czechoslovak government in exile , is proclaimed by the inscription of "Pravda Vítězí" which translates to "Truth Will Prevail" and surrounds a bronze relief portrait of the first President and founder of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk .  In a wrought-iron case near the window bay, a letter penned by the hand of Masaryk to students at the University of Pittsburgh recalls John Amos Comenius' belief that "education is the workshop of humanity".  All woodwork, except the furniture, is made of larch wood which grows to great heights in the Carpathian Mountains . The ceiling, with flat boards overlapping each other between heavy beams, is painted by Prague artists Karel Svolinský and Marie Svolinská and depicts botanically accurate flowers and plants of Czechoslovakia and reflects a typical Slovak farmer's home and the style of country churches.  A "tree of life" design on the rear wall surrounds the text of the proclamation by King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Charles IV that marked the founding of the University of Prague in 1348.   The plaster reveals of the bay window area is decorated by murals of miraculous trees bearing flowers and fruits and harboring animals, birds, and insects reflecting "peasant writings" and executed by the artists in freehand.  Ceiling panels portray eight famous persons in Czech and Slovak history from the 9th through 19th centuries including Cyril and Methodius who created the Cyrillic script , Waclaw who was the " Good King Wenceslaus " of the Christmas Carol , Jan Hus who was a champion of Czech religious freedom, John Amos Comenius who is considered the father of modern education, Ján Kollár a Slovak poet who called for Slavic unity, Ľudovít Štúr who developed the Slovak literary language, and Bishop Stefan Moyzes who pioneered popular education in Slovakia . Intarsia done by V. Kopka of Moravia are found on the entrance door panels and the professor's desk and lectern which depicts university academic disciplines.  Embroidery, lace, Bohemian crystal, and historical documents are displayed in the wall cabinet. [ 20 ] Early American [ edit ] The Early American Classroom Early American Room Location Room 328 Presented 1938 Style 17th century New England Colonial Architect Theodore H. Bowman, A.I.A. Pittsburgh The Early American Room is one of two display rooms not used as a functional classroom, although it is opened for guided tours.  The room was commissioned by longtime University Pittsburgh trustee George Hubbard Clapp , a descendant nine generations removed from Roger Clapp, an English captain who sailed into the New England port of Hull on May 30, 1630. The kitchen-living room of the early colonists was chosen to portray the sturdy simplicity of life in America during the 1650s. [ 21 ] The room's focus is a nine-foot fireplace constructed from 200-year-old handmade bricks with "fixings" of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, longhandled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles, and forks. A small recess in the brick wall served to bake bread. A tapered pole swings out from the end of the fireplace to be used for drying laundry or to hang a quilt to keep the cold draft from those gathered near the fire. Massive hand-hewn pine beams used in the seven-foot-high ceiling and the fireplace were collected after a careful search in Massachusetts . White pine is used for the heavy seminar table, benches, and chairs. [ 22 ] Wrought-iron candelabra are hinged with clasps to hold lighting tapers. Other light fixtures are of specially designed pierced tin. [ 23 ] The colonial-style windows were designed by glass artist Charles Connick . [ 24 ] Decorative items include a collection of 17th- and 18th-century American coins, a working spinning wheel, and a hand-stitched sampler. The small closet between the blackboard and fireplace contains a secret panel and once the concealed latch is discovered, its release causes the wall to swing open, revealing a hidden staircase to the upper loft, which has been furnished as a 19th-century bedroom.  Included in the bedroom is a four-poster rope bed and small cradle, both of which belonged to pianist and composer Ethelbert Nevin . The bedroom also includes several personal items, including an 1878 wedding quilt, which belonged to Waitman Worthington McDaniel and his wife Martha Jane Poe, the grandmother of Nationality Director Maxine Bruhns. [ 25 ] The room is associated with various stories of unexplained incidents that have resulted in claims that the room is haunted. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] English [ edit ] The English Classroom English Classroom Location Room 144 Dedicated November 21, 1952 Style 16th century Tudor-Gothic Architect Albert A. Klimcheck The English Classroom is designed in the Tudor - Gothic style after the House of Commons that was rebuilt by Sir Charles Barry following the fire of 1834.  The English Classroom is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and incorporates several original items given as gifts from the British Government from the damaged House of Commons, whose Chamber was completely destroyed, following its bombing by the Luftwaffe in 1941, including the stone fireplace, hearth tiles, linenfold oak paneling, entrance doorframe, lintel , and corbels .  The fireplace is from the Commons' "Aye Lobby", so named because members walk through it to vote "yes" to a bill, and is marked with the initials V.R. for Victoria Regina . The cast-iron fireback and andirons commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and an inscription above the fireplace is from Shakespeare's King Richard II and uses lettering adapted from the letter tiles originally designed for medieval paving by the Monks of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey . The inscription reads: "Set in the silver sea.....this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England." Above the doorway hangs a royal coat of arms made in 1688 during the reign of King James II . The linenfold paneling itself arrived at the university still having a blackened coat from the bombing. [ 27 ] Under the ceiling trusses are four carved limestone corbels from the House of Commons that are carved with a Tudor rose .  Two corbels remain uncarved to emphasize the original carved corbels. The window frames, set in limestone, are characteristic of the Tudor period, and contain old imported glass, seeded and tinted, and encased in small, diamond-shaped leaded frames. Stained-glass window medallions depict the coats of arms of English towns and cities, literary and political figures, scholars of the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford , and the Houses of Lords and Commons.  Portraits of University of Pittsburgh alumnus and former Ambassador to the Court of St. James's , Andrew Mellon , and the former Earl of Chatham , William Pitt , after whom the city was named, flank the stained glass windows in the rear bay. A brick from 10 Downing Street serves as the room's cornerstone .  The white oak floor is fitted together with wooden peg dowels . Tudor-Gothic oak benches resemble the old House of Commons benches and are similarly arranged. Two English oak tables with melon-shaped legs stand before the bay.  Two House of Commons Library chairs upholstered in green leather and bearing the official gold crest featuring the portcullis and crown were a gift of Lord Alfred Bossom and were rebuilt using wood from actual chairs in the bombed House of Commons. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] French [ edit ] The French Classroom French Classroom Location Room 149 Dedicated January 23, 1943 Style Late 18th-century French Empire Architect Jacques Carlu , Paris The French Classroom was designed by Jacques Carlu , Director of the School of Architecture in Fontainebleau , in the French Empire Period that reflects a French style inspired by the glories of the ancient and classical past that were rediscovered during the Napoleonic campaigns in Greece, Italy, and Egypt . This places the timeframe of inspiration for the classroom in the late 18th century and early 19th century, just after the founding of the University of Pittsburgh in 1787, therefore making it the only classroom which represents an era postdating the founding of the university, although many room elements are influenced by the Palace of Versailles which clearly predates it.  The color scheme of the room is blue-gray, royal blue, and gold, which were suggested by French-American architect Paul Philippe Cret and are typical colors used at the height of the French Empire. The walls of the room are lined with wood paneling in classical proportions, and slender wall pilasters are capped with delicately carved ad gilded crowns. Carved ornaments of the Egyptian griffin and classical rosettes accentuate panel divisions.  A wall cabinet containing art objects, books, and medallions balances the entrance door and maintains the room's symmetry.  Crystal and metal chandeliers, which are simplified versions of those found in Palace of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors , hang from a grey plaster ceiling. A parquet floor pattern also reflects many rooms in the Palace of Versailles. A mahogany professor's chair and table are of the Directoire period design include bronze ornaments imported from France that are replicas of originals of Empire furniture in the Louvre .  The mahogany student tablet armchairs are upholstered in royal blue. On the rear wall, a 16th-century Choufleur tapestry depicts an allegorical woodland scene including, among other animals, a unicorn which often served as a central figure in tapestries and legends from the Middle Ages .  Gold damask draperies with a wreath and lyre motif add to the sense of French opulence and frame the windows which look out on the university's Heinz Memorial Chapel , itself an example of French Gothic architecture inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. [ 30 ] German [ edit ] The German Classroom German Classroom Location Room 119 Dedicated July 8, 1938 Style 16th-century German Renaissance Architect Frank A. Linder, Germany/U.S. The German Classroom was designed by German-born architect Frank A. Linder to reflect the 16th century German Renaissance as exemplified in the Alte Aula (Great Hall) of the University of Heidelberg . The woodwork of the room was done by German-born Philadelphia decorator Gustav Ketterer and includes walnut paneling framing the blackboards, columns carved with arabesques flanking the two entrance doorways, and support broken-arch pediments surmounted by carved polychromed crests of the two oldest German universities: Heidelberg (1386) and Leipzig (1409). The doors are mounted with ornate wrought-iron hinges and locks, and their upper panels are decorated with intarsia depicting the central square of Nürnberg on the front door and the fountain of Rothenburg on the rear door. Carved in the architrave above the paneling are the names of famous philosophers, poets, musicians, artists, and scientists. The intarsia doors of the four corner cabinets feature tales from German folklore including Parsifal who searched for the Holy Grail , Siegfried who was the hero of the Nibelungenlied , the maiden wooed in Goethe's poem Heidenröslein , and Lorelei who was the golden-haired Rhine maiden whose song lured sailors to destruction. Painted on the escutcheon above the front blackboard are words from Friedrich Schiller 's Das Ideal und das Leben , "Stern endeavor, which no arduous task can shake, to the hidden fount of true attains." The rear wall has a quotation from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 's Was wir bringen which reads: "Great mastery results from wise restraint, and law alone points the way to liberty." Furniture includes the professor's leather upholstered chair stands on a small platform behind a burled walnut table and student tablet armchairs are walnut with scroll backs. Wrought-iron chandeliers are the work of German craftsman.  The display case contains gifts of artworks and books from Germany's Ministry of Education. The stained-glass windows were designed by master stained glass artist Charles Connick , however they were not completed until 1953 by Connick protege Frances Van Arsdale Skinner. [ 24 ] The windows depict characters in the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood , Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Hansel and Gretel , and Cinderella . [ 31 ] Greek [ edit ] The Greek Classroom Greek Classroom Location Room 137 Dedicated November 7, 1941 Style 5th Century B.C. Classical Architect John Travlos , Athens The classical architecture of the Greek Classroom [ 32 ] represents 5th-century BCE. Athens , the Golden Age of Pericles and includes marble columns and a coffered ceiling. Colored details from the Acropolis' Propylaea and Erectheum appear on white marble. The floor is paved with rectangular slabs of Dionessos Pentelic marble with dark vein. [ 33 ] Gray Kokinara marble is used for the dado . The room's columns and pilasters, as well as the coffered ceiling, bear painted decorations identical to those used on ancient Greek structures. The artwork was done by Athenian artist Demetrios Kokotsis who used the traditional encaustic painting method, employing earth colors and beeswax applied freehand which was then overlaid with 24-carat gold leaf rubbed on by polishing bones which required two men more than seven months to complete. White oak furniture, patterned after designs on Greek vases, is decorated with gold-leaf carvings and sunburst inlays of ebony. Student chair backs carry the names of Greek islands and towns. The professor's and guests' chairs bear the names of Plato , Aristotle , and Socrates . A line from Homer's Iliad exhorts students to strive for nobility and excellence. The deep red wall color is repeated in the drapery valance with its Greek key design. Archives in the alcove cabinet record visits by the Queen of Greece, and by ecclesiastic and diplomatic officials.  In 1940, one of two marble pilasters for the room that was being constructed in Greece from the Mt Pentele stone quarry used to build the Parthenon , cracked shortly before shipping to the United States. With an invading World War II army massing on its borders, the column could not be replaced. Greek architect John Travlos ordered a matching crack etched into the undamaged column in order to preserve the symmetry. The marble was transported on the last ship to sail to America prior to the invasion and occupation of Greece. In November 1941, Travlos crouched under a blanket in his apartment closet listening to banned BBC radio broadcasts. Suddenly, Greek ecclesiastical music spouted from the radio, and Travlos heard the people of Pittsburgh dedicate his memorial to Greece. [ 27 ] Hungarian [ edit ] The Hungarian Classroom Hungarian Classroom Location Room 121 Dedicated September 29, 1939 Style Folk Motif Architect Dénes Györgyi , Budapest Dénes Györgyi , a professor at the Industrial Art School in Budapest , won the Hungarian Classroom design competition sponsored by Hungary's Ministry of Education in 1930 which features Magyar folk art combined with deep wood carvings and historic stained glass windows.  The walls of the room are oak veneer stained a soft tobacco brown.  The wood in the panels was carefully selected and matched, so that the natural grains form interesting decorative patterns.  The ceiling is 70 wooden cazettas suspended in a wooden frame and has a predominant hue of " paprika red", a color inspired by the peppers which are hung to dry over white fences in Hungary.  The cazettas are decorated with folk motifs (birds, hearts, and tulips ) in turquoise, green, and white were painted by Antal Diossy in Budapest.  Joining the ceiling and walls is an inscription frieze with the first two stanzas of Himnusz , the Hungarian National Anthem by Ferenc Kölcsey . Above the blackboard is the coat of arms of the University of Buda which was founded in 1388.  At the top is the crown of St. Stephen , the patron saint of Hungary and its first Christian king.  The student seats are made of oak and are unadorned except for stylized carved tulip ornaments on the back.  A bench along the rear wall and guest chairs are upholstered in blue.  Along the corridor wall, panels carved with floral, plant, and bird designs invoke a "tulip chest" which are the traditional hope chests of Hungarian village brides that are decorated with tulips.  In the display case lined with soft blue velvet is an exhibit of Hungarian porcelain, lace, embroidery, and costumed dolls.  Stained and painted glass windows depict the legend of Hungary's founding as well as important events in the nation's history and culture. The rear window depicts King Nimrod and his sons, Hunor and Magor , who pursued a white stag from the east to the fertile Danube plain. Descendants of Hunor became the Huns and those of Magor became the Magyars. The bay windows commemorate historic figures and events of the Middle Ages , Renaissance , and 17th and 19th centuries. The oak entrance doors bears deep carvings of tulips, pomegranate leaves, daisies, and wheat.  The door's center panel states the date of the room's completion in 1938. The carvings were made by American wood carvers of Hungarian birth from plaster models that were made in Budapest to ensure Magyar authenticity. [ 34 ] Indian [ edit ] The Indian Classroom Indian Classroom Location Room 327 Dedicated January 9, 2000 Style 4th–9th-century Indian Renaissance Architect Deepak Wadhwani, A.I.A. The Indian Classroom is modeled on a typical 4th–9th century AD courtyard from Nalanda University , a Buddhist monastic university in Nalanda . At its peak, the university's five temples and 11 monasteries covered 32 acres (130,000 m 2 ) and attracted thousands of students from all over Asia. The room depicts a classroom courtyard at Nalanda. The pale rose bricks, specially fabricated to reflect the hue and texture of the original, form the walls, floor, pilasters, and niches. Six stone columns decorated with rosettes, swags, and fruit echo those found at Nalanda. The rear sculpture wall, a scaled down version of one at Nalanda's Stupa #3, bears images of six Bodhisattvas . Flanking display cases hold replicas of ancient bronze sculptures found at the site. A watercolor triptych depicts male and female students at Nalanda as scholar-monk Silabhadra says farewell to 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang . Gurus taught classes in the courtyards, which were surrounded by residential cells. The cherry wood chalkboard doors and flanking cabinets bear carved seals of Nalanda University with recumbent deer above a Sanskrit inscription. Cast steel grilles in front of the windows, hand wrought into forms which reflect decorative elements of the columns, filter the light and soften the view of the 20th-century outside world. [ 35 ] Renaissance 3 Architects received the Master Builders Association Craftsmanship Award for its construction. [ 36 ] Irish [ edit ] The Irish Classroom Irish Classroom Location Room 127 Dedicated May 18, 1957 Style 500–1200 A.D. Irish Romanesque Architect Harold G. Leask, Dublin The Irish Classroom is the smallest of the Nationality Rooms. [ 37 ] The limestone room is designed in Irish Romanesque style, which flourished from the 6th to the 12th centuries and is similar in type, size, and materials to oratories first built on the west coast of Ireland. Adapted from Killeshin Chapel in County Carlow , the triangular doorway gable is carved with human and animal masks against a background of zig-zag and beaded designs. The blackboard frame's pendental arches are carved with foliage, images of wolfhounds, and stylized cat masks. On the opposite wall a sculptured stone chest, under a monumental recessed arch, is patterned after a bishop's tomb in Cormac's chapel . Its ornate sculpture depicts the "Great Beast", a greyhound-like animal wreathed in interlaced ornaments . On the chest rests a replica of the Gospels from the Book of Kells . The wrought-iron case bears bird and beast designs drawn from the Book of Kells.  Stained-glass windows, created in 1956/7 by the Harry Clarke Studios in Dublin, portray famous teachers at three of Ireland's oldest centers of learning; St. Finnian at Clonard , St. Columkille at Derry , and St. Carthach at Lismore . [ 38 ] Illuminations in the Book of Kells inspired the chair design, except for the wolfhound heads. The oak-beamed ceiling is characteristic of Irish oratories. The cornerstone, from the Abbey of Clonmacnoise , is carved with the Gaelic motto, "For the Glory of God and the Honour of Ireland." The cornerstone conceals a container of earth from Northern Ireland ( County Armagh ) and the Republic of Ireland ( County Meath ). [ 39 ] The room was designed by Harold G. Leask, the former Inspector of National Monuments with The Office of Public Works (The O.P.W.) in Ireland. Gov. David L. Lawrence , Art Rooney Sr. , founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers , and James W. Knox, a member of the Pittsburgh Irish community, were on the room's organizing committee. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , Jacqueline Kennedy ordered a Marine guard to deliver the Oval Office Presidential and American flags to Evelyn Lincoln , private secretary to the president. In her will, Lincoln bequeathed the flags to the University of Pittsburgh for the Irish Room in honor of Knox. The John F. Kennedy scholarship for study in Ireland and a James W. Knox endowment for graduate study abroad were created from the proceeds generated from their auction. [ 40 ] Israel Heritage [ edit ] The Israel Heritage Classroom Israel Heritage Classroom Location Room 337 Dedicated November 1, 1987 Concept Alexander Kaufman Style 1st century Israel Stone Structure Architect Martin Chetlin, A.I.A. The Israel Heritage Classroom reflects the simplicity of a 1st-century Galilean stone dwelling or house of assembly, this room's benches are patterned after those in the 2nd–3rd-century synagogue of Capernaum . The Ten Commandments , carved in Hebrew , grace the oak entrance door.  Grapes, pomegranates , and dates on the stone frieze , copied from Capernaum, represent crops grown in the Galilee. On the window wall, an inscription discovered in the 6th-century Rehob synagogue cites the Talmudic laws governing the growing of crops each seventh year. A scroll fragment in the rear case replicates the Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll segment which contains the prophecy "They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks..." Ancient wine jars flank the scroll. The professor's table, based on one found in Jerusalem's 1st-century burnt house, stands before a copy of the only existing stone Menorah which served as a functional candelabrum . The quotation on the chair reads: "I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils." Three segments from the 6th-century Dura Europos murals grace the chalkboard doors, Ezra the Scribe , reads the law; Moses brings forth water for the 12 tribes; and the sons of Aaron consecrate the Temple. Oak benches bear the names of the 12 tribes of Israel. The floor mosaic replicates one in the 6th century Galilean synagogue of Beth Alpha . Italian [ edit ] The Italian Classroom Italian Classroom Location Room 116 Dedicated May 14, 1949 Style 15th-century Italian Renaissance Architect Ezio Cerpi, Florence The Italian Classroom reflects the serenity of a 15th-century Tuscan monastery, with its traditional devotion to religion, art, music, and education. The rear choir stall bench and shuttered windows introduce the monastic theme. The blackboard doors recall an armadio , a cabinet behind an altar used to hold priestly vestments. The turquoise soffitto a cassettoni ( coffered ceiling ), embellished with carved, gold-leafed rosettes, was inspired by one originally in the San Domenico Convent at Pesaro . In the architrave , names of famous Italians are inlaid in olive wood. The lettering resembles that used in the inscription on the Arch of Titus in Rome. Bay benches are cushioned in red velvet. The red tile floor is set in a herring-bone pattern similar to that of Florence's Palazzo Vecchio . An original Florentine fireplace, made of sandstone from the quarries of Fiesole , bears the carved Latin inscription, "O Lord, do not forsake me." On either side stand Savonarola chairs . Monastery bench designs, adapted for student use, are carved with names and founding dates of Italian universities. The oldest is the University of Bologna , established in 1088. From the front of the room, a bronze bust of Dante Alighieri faces Giovanni Romagnoli's mural of Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia , the first woman in the world to achieve a university degree when she was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1678 by the University of Padua . Japanese [ edit ] The Japanese Classroom Japanese Classroom Location Room 317 Dedicated July 25, 1999 Style Minka Designer Hirokazu Nagase, Kyoto Architect Norman Harai, A.I.A. The Japanese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, evoking the mid-18th century minka which were houses of the non-ruling classes of Japan. This room is representative of minka that might be the residence of an important village leader in a farm village on the outskirts of Kyoto and the design represents the core rooms of the house: a plank-floored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma, an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entry-way, for cooking and as a work space. The doma was also a space for household life, where farm, business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof. In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather. A central feature of the room is the massive, rough-hewn beam, the ushibari of Japanese pine , supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room.  The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature. To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post, the daikokubashira, the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the building's existing superstructure. The major posts are made of zelkova , ( keyaki ), a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern. The other beams are made of American pine. The posts and beams are connected without nails, using traditional joinery techniques. The ceiling is of bamboo with joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below.  The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls through the use of textured wallpaper and wooden wainscoting for greater durability. The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji, sliding doors of lattice frames, covered with translucent paper. The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room.  The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the ima's wooden floor. Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor, this feature has been eliminated in the classroom for practicality.  Located on the rear wall, is the tokonoma , a raised alcove for the display of treasured objects, flower arrangements, and seasonal decorations. The tokonoma has been built in shoin-style, with shôji along its exterior side. The corner post, tokobashira, is made of ebony and the floor of the tokonoma is tatami . The display cases at the rear of the room and along the interior wall contain artifacts in keeping with the period and include a chagama and furo , an iron kettle with metal charcoal hearth/brazier combination, used in the "tea ceremony". While typical minka would have no chairs at all, in keeping with its function as a classroom, the classroom has wooden chairs designed and crafted specifically for students and are consistent in design with the rest of the room. Sliding wooden panels cover the blackboard at the front of the room. The interior surface of the entry door has been modified with a wooden treatment that suggests the sliding door that was the typical entrance to a house of this period. [ 41 ] Korean [ edit ] The Korean Classroom Korean Classroom Location Room 304 Dedicated November 15, 2015 Style Joseon Dynasty Architect Minah Lee, Seoul The Korean Nationality Room is based on the 14th century Myeong-nyundang (Hall of Enlightenment), the main building at the Sungkyunkwan in Seoul which served as Korea's royal academy during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties from 918 to 1897. [ 42 ] The room mimics the three connected rooms of the Myeong-nyundan with twin oak columns forming a symbolic boundary and a central room featuring a lofted ceiling that contains two hand-carved phoenixes facing a symbolic pearl of wisdom, a design inspired by the royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. [ 43 ] The room was primarily built off-site in Korea, disassembled, and shipped to Pittsburgh, where it was reassembled in the Cathedral of Learning by Korean carpenters who kept with traditional Korean building practices of not using nails or screws in construction. [ 42 ] The room features hand cut and hand engraved Douglas fir and red pine logs from South Korea that include swirling engraved designs based on traditional Korean architecture. [ 44 ] Windows are covered with a specially produced paper product made of mulberry tree fiber. [ 42 ] A symbolic back door leading to a windowed bay that faces Heinz Chapel alludes to a door in the Myeong-nyudang which leads to the Sungkyunkwan's courtyard. [ 15 ] The south wall displays three documents that explain the letters and principles of the Hangul , or Korean alphabet, which was created by the court of Sejong the Great in 1443. [ 45 ] A display niche to the right of the classrooms blackboards contains a book illustrating Crown Prince Hyomyeong 's matriculation to Sungkyunkwan in 1817, while another niche displays the Four Treasures of the Study : brush, ink, paper and ink-stone. [ 45 ] Furnishings include freestanding, hard-oak desks by Korean designer Ji-hoon Ha that accommodate two to three students and are specifically designed for laptops. [ 44 ] The room also contains an 85-inch, 3-D LED screen and central speaker system and is the first nationality room to be constructed with such technology. [ 42 ] Lithuanian [ edit ] The Lithuanian Classroom Lithuanian Classroom Location Room 129 Dedicated October 4, 1940 Style Folk Motif Architect Antanas Gudaitis, Kaunas The Lithuanian Classroom is dominated by a fresco depicting Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis' famous painting The Two Kings , which portrays the reverence Lithuanians have for their villages. This mural sets the tone for a room that pays tribute to the symbolism and love of nature and home reflected in Lithuanian folk art. The door's wooden planks are laid in a diamond pattern similar to those of many farm structures. At the center of the door is a carved rosette, symbol of fire. Above the entrance, a stylized sun between two horses' heads represents light and sound believed to ward off evil spirits. The white oak molding of intersecting scallops resembles decorations found on farm granaries or kleitis. Names of famous Lithuanians are carved on the frieze above the blackboard. The wall fabric is linen woven in a design called "The Path of the Birds". Its frame is of white oak and rare bog oak that acquires its deep hue while submerged in a marshy bog for decades. Lithuanian farmers would thus preserve prime trees in order to make furniture pieces that were treasured as heirlooms. The professor's desk is modeled after a household table and the lectern incorporates details of a spinning wheel spindle. Student chairs are carved with a design found on household utensils. The radiator enclosure is perforated with a design of wild rue leaves, a Lithuanian national emblem . Traditionally, a bride is crowned with a wreath of rue, symbol of chastity. Windows of handpressed glass bear leaded medallions in the form of sun ornaments often found on roadside shrines. Norwegian [ edit ] The Norwegian Classroom Norwegian Classroom Location Room 151 Dedicated May 15, 1948 Style Folk Motif Architect Georg Eliassen, Oslo The Norwegian Classroom was designed in Oslo in an 18th-century peasant style using Norwegian building techniques, painted decoration, and craftsmanship by architect Georg Eliassen just prior to the outbreak of World War II . Plans for the room were sent on the last ship to leave Petsamo for the United States where they were completed by University Architect Albert A. Klimcheck.  Walls of the main space are paneled with vertical overlapping spruce boards hand-rubbed with wax.  The walls in the front of the room are painted a soft blue and decorated with floral designs reminiscent of the 18th century rosemaling technique. Because living and bedrooms were often merged into one room during this era, two of the panels swing open as if they would reveal traditional built-in-beds, but instead conceal the blackboard. The room features high-sloped ceilings reflective of those in Nordic peasant homes that keep snow from accumulating during the severe winters. Spruce boards are laid in a herringbone pattern slanting upward to a plane of flat boards decorated by two hand-carved, painted rosettes with a symbol for the midnight sun .  Wooden chandeliers bearing a painted design incorporating "1945", the year the room was opened, hang from the flat surfaces.  The professor's section of the room has a low raftered ceiling. The transition between the two parts of the room is indicated by a corner kleberstone fireplace in which birch logs were burned standing on end to assure that smoke would rise up the chimney.  Windows are of handmade opalescent glass tinted pale yellow.  Since a bay window is not a Scandinavian tradition, the area is plastered, paved with slate , and treated as a traditional alcove. The student tablet armchairs are low-backed and the professor's chair is of a typical Viking design with carved heads of beasts and an intertwining dragon motif that traditionally serves as a symbol that protects against evil. The room features a century-old grandfather clock with an engraved dial and a case that is painted to match the wall decorations of the smaller room.  Above the rear wall bench and flanked by corner display cabinets decorated with rosemaling, hangs a framed copy of a 1695 Norwegian woolen tapestry depicting the Biblical parable of the five wise and five foolish virgins [ 46 ] Philippine [ edit ] The Philippine Classroom Philippine Classroom Location Room 313 Dedicated June 9, 2019 Architect Warren Bulseco, U.S., and Melinda Minerva “Popi” Laudico, Philippines The Philippine Nationality Room [ 47 ] began construction on May 3, 2018, overcoming a prior hold on the project since 2011. [ 11 ] [ 48 ] The design of the Philippine room is based on a traditional bahay na bato . [ 11 ] Meaning "house of stone", bahay na bato is a long-lasting type of home that became popular in the Philippines during the years of Spanish rule (mid-1500s to 1898). The room is particularly based on the interiors of the Quema House in the city of Vigan . [ 49 ] The Philippine Nationality Room was designed by Pittsburgh architect Warren Bulseco and Philippine architect Melinda Minerva “Popi” Laudico. Professor Fernando Zialcita , a noted authority on Philippine ancestral houses from Ateneo de Manila University, served as adviser to the project. Filipino-American artist Eliseo Art Silva created paintings for the room. The room features lattice-patterned windows using capiz shells , a popular alternative to glass in the Philippines. The chairs are backed with solihiya, rattan woven into a sunburst pattern. An etched silver Murano mirror from Europe and a bronze chandelier from the United States highlight the role of imported design in Filipino culture. Other artifacts showcase pre-Colonial cultures. The Golden Tara is a Hindu sculpture viewed by the Manobo tribe as a protective nature spirit. The Manunggul Jar , excavated from a Neolithic burial site in Palawan, depicts human figures traveling in a boat to the afterlife. The room's ceremonial key, designed by Christopher Purpura, incorporates mythological figures from the Meranao people of Mindanao—the serpent Naga and the bird Sarimanok. Polish [ edit ] The Polish Classroom Polish Classroom Location Room 126 Dedicated February 16, 1940 Style 16th-century Polish Renaissance Architect A. Szyszko-Bohusz, Kraków The Polish Classroom was inspired by rooms in Kraków 's Wawel Castle , for centuries the residence of kings. The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus , and the science that his theories revolutionized, are also a major theme of the room. A replica of the famous Jan Matejko portrait of Copernicus shows him as a young man pursuing his study of the universe from a workshop on the roof of his uncle's house in Allenstein ( Olsztyn ). In the bay stands an enlarged replica of the 16th-century Jagiellonian globe , one of the oldest existing globes to depict North America as a separate continent. The original globe was only eight inches high and was designed to operate as a clock and calendar. It took a metalsmith in Kraków five years to complete the large globe in this room. Artists from Kraków also came to Pittsburgh to paint the ceiling of 18-foot (5.5 m) beams with informal geometric Renaissance decorations. The room is illuminated by a bronze chandelier bearing a stylized Polish eagle . The walnut seminar table was copied from one in a state dining room at Wawel Castle. The windows combine hexagonal handmade roundels , similar to those in Wawel Castle, with stained-glass coats of arms representing Polish institutions of higher education. The cornerstone is a fragment of Gothic cornice preserved from the Collegium Maius (1369), the ancient Jagiellonian Library . Poland's music is represented by the original manuscript of Ignace Paderewski 's only opera, Manru , which is displayed in the archive cabinet. Romanian [ edit ] The Romanian Classroom Romanian Classroom Location Room 130 Dedicated May 16, 1943 Style 17th century Byzantine Architect N. Ghica-Budeşti, Bucharest The Romanian Classroom was designed in Bucharest by Nicolae Ghica-Budeşti. The carved doorframe is characteristic of stone thresholds of Romanian monasteries and is made is of American limestone selected due to its similarity to Romanian limestone used in the royal palace at Bucharest. The entrance door of the Romanian Classroom is ornately carved oak reminiscent of Byzantine churches in Romania. The words of Vasile Alecsandri , one of the greatest Romanian poets of the 19th century, are carved overhead in the stone door frame from his Ode to the Year 1855 : "The Romanian is like the mighty rock which amidst the waves of the stormy and majestic sea forever remains unmoved." The floor is laid in square blocks of pink marble imported from quarries at Ruşchiţa. The black boards are set in arched oak panels, carved in a manner of icon screens in Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Romanian churches. These are separated by carved-twisted rope which suggests the Roman origin of many of Romania's artistic traditions. Ancient original icons from Romania depicting the Virgin and Child , Christ , the Dormition of the Virgin , and Saint Mark are embedded in the upper section of each panel. White arca paint mixed with color gives the smooth plastered walls a bluish pink tint. A Byzantine-style mosaic embedded in the rear wall, a gift of the Romanian government, was executed by Bucharest ceramicist Nora Steriade in gold, turquoise, bronze, ruby red, and black pieces of glass, and was originally part of the Romanian Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair . [ 50 ] The lettering for the inscription and for the entrance text is the work of Alexander Seceni. The mosaic depicts Constantin Brâncoveanu , Prince of Wallachia , who refused to recant the Christian faith even at the cost of his own life and the lives of the male members of his family. The six windows have rounded Romanesque heads reflecting tradition brought from Rome when they conquered the original Dacian settlers in 106 AD. Two small window casements are deeply recessed and have marble window ledges. The four large center windows, form an alcove shut off from the main part of the room by an iron grilled gates wrought in Romania and hung in an arch. These gates swing back in folded sections against the plastered wall. A slab of polished marble tops the wrought-iron radiator grille. Yellow silk draperies frame the windows and ancient icons befitting the season and holidays are exhibited in the alcove which is reminiscent of an icon shrine in an Orthodox Church.   The student chairs are of dark oak hand-carved by Romanian peasant artisans using simple pocketknives and each splat bears a different design.  The professor's reading desk was adapted from an Eastern Orthodox Church lectern . [ 51 ] Russian [ edit ] The Russian Classroom Russian Classroom Location Room 153 Dedicated July 8, 1938 Style Byzantine and Folk Motifs Designer Andrey Avinoff , Tultchin The Russian Classroom contains folk ornamentation with traditional motifs from Byzantium , the spiritual center of Russia.  The seminar table is made of oak slabs matched in contrasting grain and held together by ornamental keys. The cut-out apron is characteristic of massive tables in the Vologda district. The back of each student's chair has a cruciform circle pattern surmounted by triangles carved with symbols of regional or stylistic significance including the reindeer which symbolizes the tundra and the sturgeon that represents the Volga River .  The professor's chair has a back of spirals surmounted by two peacocks worshipping the tree of life.  The podium is ecclesiastic in character and suggests the analoi used in Orthodox churches to support heavy Bibles. The blackboard is patterned after a triptych , or three-leafed frame which holds icons. The doors of the blackboard are a grille of wooden spirals backed by red velvet.  Above them is a carved panel with Sirin and Alcanost, the twin birds of Russian folklore that depict joy and sorrow as indistinguishable. A dado or low wainscot of simple horizontal oaken boards surrounds the room and incorporates the blackboard, the corner cupboard, and kiot which is a Slavic term for a wall frame treated as a piece of furniture. Within the kiot hangs a vishivka ( appliqué and embroidery ) banner of Saint George , patron saint of Moscow since the 15th century. The banner was made with pieces of 16th and 17th century fabric from Venice and Paris and is an example of needlework once popular with the Russian aristocracy.  The words "Valorous youth victorious over forces of evil and darkness" are carved in both Russian and English below the banner. A copy of the Avinoff family icon in the room depicts the miraculous saving of the city of Kitej from a Tartar invasion in the 14th century.  The ceiling is cornered with designs resembling those used to form traditional Easter cakes and which symbolize the four seasons, with a bud for Spring, a sunflower for summer, grapes for Autumn, and a pine cone for Winter. A wrought iron chandelier was created by Russian-born Hyman Blum. Following a visit from Dmitry Medvedev in 2009, a display cabinet with carved ornamentation matching the rooms original carvings was installed to house three gifts presented by the then Russian President . [ 52 ] Scottish [ edit ] The Scottish Classroom Scottish Classroom Location Room 139 Dedicated July 8, 1938 Style 17th century Architect Reginald Fairlie, Edinburgh The Scottish Classroom was designed by Reginald Fairlie of Edinburgh in the period style of the early 17th century.  The woodwork is carefully selected and treated English pollard oak.  The names of distinguished Scots are carved in the ribbon bands of the panels and include David Livingstone who was an African missionary and explorer, Robert Louis Stevenson who authored Treasure Island , and Alexander Fleming who discovered penicillin .  The inscriptions above the doors and the rear cabinet are from " The Brus " by the 14th-century Scottish poet John Barbour .  The room's oak doors were copied from the entrance of Rowallan Castle in Ayrshire .  A 16th-century Scottish proverb above the blackboard was taken from the Cowgate in Edinburgh and is known as "the Scottish Golden Rule" which reads: "Gif Ye did as Ye sould Ye might haif as Ye would." The plaster frieze was adapted from the plaster frieze at Elcho Castle in Perthshire and incorporates symbols of 14 Scottish clans which had members on the room committee, such as the buckle of the Leslie Clan .  The thistle , Scotland's national flower, is rendered on the cornerstone as a tree-of-life.  The overmantel of the Scottish sandstone fireplace that is flanked by carved kists, or log storage chests, is dominated by a portrait of poet Robert Burns that is copied from an original by Alexander Nasmyth which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland .  Above the portrait is the cross of St. Andrew , Scotland's patron saint. The bronze statuettes on the mantel near an arrangement of dried heather are miniature replicas of heroic statues at the gateway to Edinburgh Castle and represent the 13th-century patriot Sir William Wallace and the 14th century freedom fighter, Robert the Bruce , both of whom were popularized in the movie Braveheart . Medallions in the bay windows represent the coats of arms of the four ancient Scottish universities: Glasgow , St. Andrew's , Aberdeen , and Edinburgh .  The medallions in the front and rear windows are of Elgin and Melrose Abbeys which were 13th and 16th century seats of learning.  The draperies are of crewel-embroidered linen.  The rooms lighting fixtures were inspired by an iron coronet in Edinburgh's John Knox Museum that was retrieved from the battlefield of Bannockburn at which Scotland won its independence from England in 1314.  Student's seats resemble a chair that belonged to John Knox .  An old Scottish church furnished the pattern for the reading stand.  The rear cabinet, based on an aumbry or weapon closet, contain artifacts such as pewter and china used at Soutar's Inn in Ayrshire that was frequented by Robert Burns. The panels in the doors, mantel, and in-the-wall cabinets were carved in Edinburgh by Thomas Good and then shipped to Pittsburgh.  The cabinetwork was done in the shops of Gustav Ketterer of Philadelphia . Wrought ironwork was done by Samuel Yellin .  Cut into stone above the doorways are the thistle and the Lion Rampant , the Scottish emblem incorporated into Britain's royal arms . The chairman of the original Scottish Classroom Committee was Jock Sutherland . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Swedish [ edit ] Swedish Nationality Room. Swedish Classroom Location Room 135 Dedicated July 8, 1938 Style Folk Motif Architect Linton R. Wilson Adviser Carl Milles , Stockholm The Swedish Classroom reflects a peasant cottage and contains murals painted by Olle Nordmark . The special glory of the room is the rear wall paintings. The inspiration for the four framed paintings came from painted panels done by the 18th-century painter from Hälsingland , Gustav Reuter . Linton Wilson found the panels at the Nordic Museum . [ 55 ] The hooded brick fireplace derives from an original in the Bollnäs Cottage in Skansen , the famous outdoor museum in Stockholm . The brilliant white walls and fireplace are constructed of 200-year-old handmade bricks. The fire tools were handwrought by Ola Nilsson, a Swedish blacksmith. He reconstructed tools used in his childhood home in Sweden. [ 56 ] A subtle sense of humor associated with the Swedish people is revealed in the room's paintings. A wall fresco secco depicts the Three Wise Men dressed as cavaliers riding to Bethlehem , in two directions. In their midst is Sweden's patron saint, St. Catherine . The sloped ceiling bears decorations in which the central figure is the Archangel Gabriel , seen as a droll trumpeter with two left feet. Nearby are renditions of Justice and Knowledge surrounded by groupings of flowers. Justice uses her blindfold to hold scales that appear balanced but have an off-center fulcrum. Knowledge seems puzzled as she contemplates writing on her slate with a quill pen. Furniture and woodwork are the work of Erik Jansson of Philadelphia. [ 55 ] The classroom's oak furniture is stained a muted gray-blue tone, similar to that found in old Swedish homes. Floral designs, in colors that complement the amber tone of fir wall benches, brighten the door and archive cabinet. The red brick floor is set in a herringbone pattern. Swiss [ edit ] Swiss Nationality Room Swiss Classroom Location Room 321 Dedicated April 22, 2012 Style Late Medieval Style circa 1500 Designer Justin Rüssli, Lucerne Architect Stephen Altherr The Swiss Classroom is modeled after a 15th-century room from Fraumunster Abbey displayed in the Swiss National Museum in Zurich , Switzerland. [ 57 ] The room is paneled in pine wood and features four white oak trestle tables and four display cases that represent the four languages of Switzerland: French, German, Italian, and Romansch .  26 country-style chairs contain painted carvings of the symbols of Switzerland's cantons that form the Swiss Confederation which united in 1291. The furniture and woodwork were crafted by Richard Sink of French Creek, WV. [ 57 ] A centerpiece of the room is a reproduction of a cocklestove that is modeled on a H.H. Graaf family oven on display in Schloss Wülflingen Castle , Winterthur . The cocklestove's ornate tiles contain several painted Swiss motifs that including various animals, plants, edelweiss , the heraldic emblem of the Graaf family, and a depiction of the Swiss legend of William Tell . [ 58 ] Windows are leaded and feature three stained-glass shields of the original Swiss cantons as well as the Swiss Cross . The Swiss Cross is also displayed stone over the door, within the window of the door, and on the lectern which is modeled on a 17th-century schoolmaster's desk. A carved and painted frieze depicts Swiss flora and fauna and an antique map depicts Switzerland by its ancient Latin name of "Helvetia". Portraits on the back wall, done in the style of Hans Holbein the Younger , depict Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi . Wood beamed ceiling contains LED lights that are hidden behind rosettes. [ 14 ] Syria-Lebanon [ edit ] The Syria-Lebanon Room Syria-Lebanon Room Location Room 160 Dedicated June 28, 1941 Style 18th century Damascus Architect unrecorded Originally a library built in 1782 in a wealthy Damascan merchant's home, the Syria - Lebanon Room was moved intact to its location in the Cathedral of Learning following a six-year effort to fund and install the room by the Syrian and Lebanese communities in Pittsburgh. Because of the fragility and pricelessness of the furnishing, it has been closed for class use and is one of two display rooms. The linden -paneled walls and ceilings are decorated with " gesso painting," a mixture of chalk and glue applied by brush in intricate relief, then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf. The room features a (now improperly oriented) mihrab with a stalactite vault traditionally housing the Koran and prayer rug . Set in the walls are book cabinets and display shelves. [ 59 ] The room is illuminated by an old mosque lamp of perforated copper with handblown glass wells that originally held oil, water, and wicks. The sofas, from the Arabic word "suffah", are covered in satin and rest on a dark red and white marble foundation. The marble floor slopes down at the entrance where visitors would remove their shoes before entering. In 1997, a glass-paneled French-style door to the room was added to allow the room to be visible from passers-by.  The doors were patterned after a grille design found on the windows of the 18th century Ibn Room in the Islamic section of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. [ 60 ] Turkish [ edit ] The Turkish Classroom Turkish Classroom Location Room 339 Dedicated March 4, 2012 Style Baş Odası circa 1400AD Designer Ömer Akın Architect Ömer Akın and John Cleary The Turkish Nationality Room was based on a baş odası, or main room, of a typical Turkish house or hayat with an outer gallery and a side iwan . The iwan is intended to be used as an entrance area similar to the royal pavilion, annexed to the Yeni Mosque in the Eminönü district of Istanbul , which was built in 1663 for the use of Sultan Mehmet IV . [ 61 ] In the iwan of the Turkish Nationality Room, four ceramic panels, painted on clay tiles in Ankara , represent various cultures and points in Turkish history. [ 62 ] The largest ceramic is a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey , who is depicted instructing the nation on the Turkish alphabet adopted in 1928. Other panels depict Uighur princesses, who represent the importance of women in circa 9th-century Turkish culture, a reproduction of "Two merchants in conversation" by Mehmed Siyah Kalem [ tr ] which signifies the appearance of realism in Turkish drawing around the 14th century; and a depiction of Suleiman the Magnificent at the circumcision ceremony of Şehzade Beyazıt and Şehzade Cihangir which represents the apex of Ottoman power and culture in the 16th century.  The main room attempts to convey the theme of democracy with its seating distributed around the perimeter of the room which suggests that all occupants are equals. Hardwood seats mimic divan -style seating found in a typical baş odası with back panels that function as writing tablets which when retracted form a "parted curtain" motif, a common shape used for household wall niches. The room's ceiling, modeled after the Emirhocazade Ahmet Bey summer house in Safranbolu , is a combination of traditional çitakâri and kündekâri carpentry art that creates intricate geometric patterns using small pieces of wood attached without metal fasteners or glue. Clear glass windows along one wall frame a painted mural depicting a panoramic view of Istanbul which is feature similar to that seen in the mirrored room of the Topkapi Palace . The stained glass windows depict a tulip shape which served as a symbol of the Ottomans in the 18th century.  Display cases contain historic examples of Turkish calligraphy , ceramics, jewelry, miniatures and textiles as well as an evil eye . The entrance symbol above the exterior door depicts the current flag of Turkey , adopted in 1936. Ukrainian [ edit ] The Ukrainian Classroom Ukrainian Classroom Location Room 341 Dedicated June 17, 1990 Style 17th–18th century Ukrainian Baroque Designer Lubomyr E. Kalynych Architect Walter R. Boykowycz, A.I.A. The Ukrainian Classroom is designed in Baroque style with richly carved wood, colorful ceramics, and intricate metalwork in this adaptation of a nobleman's reception room. The entrance has an archaic trapezoidal form with carved motifs of water (chevron), wheat, and sunflowers. The lintel inscription commemorates Ukraine's millennium of Christianity (988–1988). The stove tiles depict festival practices and daily life. A pokutia, or place of honor, is defined by the benches and the traditional icons of St. Nicholas , the Mother of God , Christ the Teacher, and St. George . The chalkboard doors bearing the Tree of Life are surmounted by three Cyrillic alphabets used in Ukraine in the 11th, 17th, and 19th centuries. On the right wall, a copper bas-relief depicts the development of Ukrainian culture over the millennia. It portrays cultural centers, historical figures, rituals, monuments, and the evolution of Ukrainian ornament. The massive crossbeam's elaborate carvings include a protective solar symbol and a quotation from Ukraine's bard Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861): "Learn, my brothers! Think and read ... Learn foreign thoughts, but do not shun your own country!"  Beyond the wood posts, reminiscent of a gallery, the display case houses traditional Ukrainian art and crafts. Welsh [ edit ] The Welsh Classroom Welsh Classroom Location Room 342 Dedicated June 1, 2008 Style 18th century Non-Conformist chapel Architect Martin Powell, Katherine Horstman, Richard Freeman, Yaso Snyder The Welsh Classroom, was perhaps the longest in coming, as reservations for a Welsh room were originally requested in the 1930s. [ 63 ] The existing room, installed on the third floor of the Cathedral of Learning, is patterned after the Pen-rhiw Chapel at St Fagans National History Museum near Cardiff and represents a traditional 18th-century Welsh chapel, which often became the center of village social life. [ 64 ] By that time, the English ruled the country and imposed law requiring English as the official language of the courts and churches.  In order to worship and hold church services in their native Welsh language , and spurred on by the non-conformist movement started by the Protestant Reformation , the Welsh people met in secret locations such as barns or homes, as suggested by the simple white walled chapel modeled in this Nationality Room.  The minister would live at one end as depicted by the display case with dishes and pottery that would be found in a Welsh kitchen and the long oak case clock seated on a Welsh slate foundation opposite the main blue door.  The clock, considered one of the most important furnishings in a Welsh home, has, instead of numbers, a painted square face that spells out "Richard Thomas" suggesting that he was both the maker and owner of the clock. The bay window serves as the focus of the Welsh chapel worship, including a blue raised pulpit with a view of the entire congregation and two Deacon's benches from which to monitor the actions of the minister and congregation. At the other end of the room is a table bearing a lectern, as such worship places would often become a school room for both children and adults during week days.  Above the chalk board is the Lord's Prayer , written in Welsh. [ 65 ] Pew benches of pine face the lectern.  Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn cattle stalls, would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made of poplar and flooring suggests a typical chapel dirt floor.  The carved stone dragon over the doorway, the long-time Welsh national symbol , represents the legendary victory of the Red Dragon over the White Dragon of numerous tales of medieval Welsh literature and represents the triumph of Good over Evil. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Yugoslav [ edit ] The Yugoslav Classroom Yugoslav Classroom Location Room 142 Dedicated March 31, 1939 Style Folk Motif Architect Vojta Braniš [ hr ] , Zagreb The Yugoslav Classroom was designed by Professor Vojta Braniš [ hr ] , a sculptor and director of the Industrial Art School in Zagreb .  The walls are paneled in Slavonian oak and hand-carved with geometric figures and the old Slavonic heart design which is combined with a running geometric border, a favorite with South Slavs .  This type of work, known as "notch-carving", was traditionally done with a penknife as pastime of peasants.  On the corridor wall is a specially designed coat of arms featuring a double-headed eagle symbolizing the religious influences of Eastern Empire of Byzantium and Western Empire of Rome along with the founding dates of the universities in Belgrade , Ljubljana , and Zagreb .  The ceiling is carved with intricate Croatian , Slovenian , and Serbian folk motifs and the wooden chandeliers are similar to those in the White Palace in Belgrade. The professor's chair and guests chairs were carved by students at the International Art School in Zagreb, and each spindle of the chairs bears a different notched design.  At the window, a bronze sculpture by Vojta Braniš, "Post-War Motherhood", depicts a barefoot mother nursing her child whom she has protected during the long months of war.  In the display cabinet is a lace portrayal of the Madonna of Brežje by Slovenes Leopoldina Pelhan and her student Mila Božičkova which took six months to complete and was inspired by the story of a lace Madonna created by the villagers of Sveta Gora in order to replace a priceless painting during World War I . [ 69 ] The ceiling squares contain one of the three alternating ceiling ornaments suggesting flowers, stars, the sun, and other radiating geometric patterns, which are organized into a matrix of 9 by 7 squares. Above the paneled walls, six portraits depict prominent Yugoslavs. On the front wall are portraits of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864) who compiled the Serbian dictionary and collected, edited, and published Serbian national ballads and folk songs; and Croatian statesman Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer (1815–1905) who was known for his efforts to achieve understanding between the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, founder of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts ). On the corridor wall are likenesses of Baron George von Vega (1754–1802), a Slovenian officer in the Austrian army and mathematician recognized for various works including a book of logarithm tables; and Petar Petrović Njegoš (1813–1851), the last prince-bishop of Montenegro , who was celebrated for his poetry.  Represented on the rear wall are Rugjer Bošković (1711–1787), a Ragusan scientist distinguished for his achievements in the fields of mathematics, optics, and astronomy; and France Prešeren (1800–1849) who is considered the greatest Slovenian classical poet. The Yugoslav Classroom's executive committee was first organized in 1926 under the chairmanship of Anton Gazdić, the president of the Croatian Fraternal Union . After his death in September 1933 the new chairman was Steve Babić, the previous vice-chairman, and the new vice-chairwoman became Catherine Rušković McAleer.

Museum: Pittsburgh_Center_for_the_Arts
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts Location within Pittsburgh Former name Pittsburgh Arts and Crafts Center Established 1945 Location Pittsburgh Coordinates 40°27′09″N 79°55′12″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.452406°N 79.920133°W ﻿ / 40.452406; -79.920133 Website http://center.pfpca.org/ Pittsburgh Landmark – PHLF Designated 1971 [ 1 ] The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PCA) is a non-profit community arts campus that offers arts education programs and contemporary art exhibitions in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States . [ 2 ] It also provides services and resources for artists throughout Western Pennsylvania . PCA provides a venue for the community to create, see, support, and learn about visual arts. Founded in 1945, PCA is located at 6300 Fifth Avenue in the Shadyside neighborhood. [ 3 ] Though, according to the City of Pittsburgh Map, the center is located in the Point Breeze neighborhood. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Pop artist Keith Haring had his first exhibition at the Pittsburgh Arts and Crafts Center in 1978 before moving to New York City and becoming one of the most prolific artists of the late 20th century. [ 6 ] History [ edit ] Founding [ edit ] The PCA's opened on March 17, 1945, as the "Arts and Craft Center" at Fifth and Shady Avenues. [ 7 ] Almost 1000 Pittsburghers gathered at the opening night ceremonies, headed by Mayor Cornelius D. Scully , J. Bailey Ellis, who was named chairman of the Center, and Mrs. Charles D. Marshall, who publicly turned the key to her home over to the city. Ten artist groups comprised the center at its founding: Pittsburgh Drama League (founded 1913) Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen (founded 1944) Weavers Guild of Pittsburgh (founded 1940) Society of Sculptors (founded 1934) Pittsburgh Civic Ballet (founded 1941) Abstract Artists Group of Pittsburgh Musician's Club of Pittsburgh (founded 1913) Associated Artists of Pittsburgh (founded 1910) Contemporary Dance Group Authors’ Club (founded 1918). The first program after the grand opening was a musicale given by the Musician's Club on March 25, 1945. Each of the ten groups was responsible for holding five programs open to the public each year. The first Christmas Bazaar was held in November 1946, and continues today as the Holiday Sale. The organization was chartered in July 1947. The first annual meeting to which all members of the various artist groups were invited was held on January 12, 1948. The newly revised by-laws were read and accepted. The elected board and officers were unpaid. The center's dedication to improving the overall quality of life in Pittsburgh through education has been an essential part of its philosophy from the beginning. The first mention of classes appeared in the minutes of the June 1947 board meeting. University of Pittsburgh professor Walter Hovey, then president of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen, asked for the use of the kitchen in order to hold a jewelry class for some 40 students. In addition to education, the center has always sought to promote regional art. In 1948, the first Everyman's Art Show was held, open to the region's amateurs. The first Artist of the Year show was held in January 1949, honoring painter Balcombe Greene. In the April 1954, the Center went on the air on WQED-TV with the weekly, half-hour series You, the Artists hosted by sculptor Everett Sturgeon. From 1981 to 1989, the center renewed its relationship with WQED with the weekly Lyceum (later Studio 13 ,) hosted by Mary Rawson. Ongoing attempts were made in print as well, starting from the earliest days with a mimeographed newsletter, Musings , from 1975-79 with Quidnunc , and later in expanded course catalogs and the quarterly Art Lines . Reorganizing [ edit ] Eventually, volunteers could not keep abreast of an increasingly complex artistic and organizational environment. By the late 1960s, the center's administration resembled “an octopus without a head,” according to the Pittsburgh Press's Patricia Lowry. Artist Danny Butts was engaged as the center's first full-time director. He was succeeded by businessman Jerrold Rouby in 1970. Additional paid positions were added then: an education director and sales director. The Center's classes and enrollment expanded during Rouby's tenure. In 1975, Audrey Bethel became the center's director. Under her leadership, the groundwork was laid for many changes. Nationally known artists visited the center, the board of directors was restructured, and the center's name was changed. Cheryl Towers became director in 1981, and later hired ceramicist Sande Deitch as full-time exhibitions director. Deitch became director of the Center in 1987; Murray Horne became exhibitions director. Post-1990s [ edit ] Kim Beck , Pittsburgh Center of the Arts Emerging Artist 2006 Charcoal on paper For the center, the late 1990s were marked with ambitious programs, but also financial difficulty. In February 2002, five staff—including Executive Director Laura Willumsen and Curator Vicky Clark—were laid off and the exhibitions department eliminated. In August 2004, 13 staff members were laid off. The center was approximately $1 million in debt, and its doors were closed. The center has offered special prizes of Artist of the Year and Emerging Artist of the Year, along with its Biennial exhibitions of local contemporary artists. Previous winners of prizes include Delanie Jenkins, Clayton Merrill, and George Anastasios Magalios . In September 2004, Charlie Humphrey became the unpaid interim director of PCA. The center reopened, after having been closed only for a few weeks. In relatively short order, missed payments to artists were rectified and relationships with foundations were repaired. In January 2006, following votes by the Pittsburgh Filmmakers membership, Pittsburgh Center for the Arts board and Pittsburgh Filmmakers board, the merger of the two organizations became final. The Pittsburgh Filmmakers by-laws were carried over as the by-laws of the merged organization. In Fall 2010, the combined Pittsburgh Filmmakers /Pittsburgh Center for the Arts entered into merger discussions with the Pittsburgh Glass Center . [ 8 ] By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations. [ 8 ] Facilities [ edit ] Throughout the years many renovations were made at both the Marshall building, which houses the galleries, and the Scaife building, which houses the school. The last major renovation was to the Marshall building, which reopened March 24, 1990 with a dedication by Mayor Sophie Masloff to 800 guests, including Jane Marshall Fisher, granddaughter of the building's original donor. The center has a campus arrangement of four buildings, three of which (two mansions and a carriage house) are rented from the city for $1.00 per year. The fourth structure houses newly built kilns. PCA buildings [ edit ] For the industrialists in the early 1900s, a major living area was Pittsburgh's East End, where a building boom was underway. A parade of mansions were commissioned along Fifth Avenue to what became known as “Millionaires Row” for some of the wealthiest and most celebrated families in Pittsburgh, such as the Mellons, the Benedums, and the Fricks. In 1909, one of the most impressive mansions built was the 65-room Richard Beatty Mellon House on the 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land bordering Fifth Avenue, Shady Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard on what is now known as Mellon Park . Richard Beatty Mellon and his wife Jennie King Mellon raised two children, Sarah Cordelia King Mellon and Richard King Mellon . Jennie King Mellon had a love for flowers and had two very large flower gardens facing Beechwood Boulevard, which still exists in Mellon Park today. Next to the mansion was a garage and carriage house, which housed servants on the second floor. This carriage house was donated to the City and is now the Phipps Garden Center. The 65-room mansion was torn down in 1941. In 1904, there was another earlier Tudor revival mansion built on the Mellon Estate. It was given as a wedding gift in 1927 to Richard Beatty's daughter Sarah, who married Alan Magee Scaife, fifth generation industrialist and the Director of Mellon National Bank . In February 1946, the Scaifes also donated their home and property to the City. This mansion is now the Scaife Building that houses the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts School. Next door to the Mellon Estate, on the corner of Fifth and Shady Avenues, Charles D. Marshall, president and co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, which later became Bethlehem Steel , built his mansion. Completed in 1912, the Marshall mansion was an impressive formal 17th-Century Carolean-inspired building. In 1943, Charles Marshall also donated his house at 6300 Fifth Avenue to the city. The city was responsible for only the exterior maintenance. The Marshall mansion became the Arts and Crafts Center of Pittsburgh in 1945. In 1980, the name was again changed to what is now known as the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. External links [ edit ] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Pittsburgh Center for the Arts .

It is widely regarded as one of America 's most colorful public art landmarks. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Randy Gilson is the founder of this museum, which showcases found object art. [ 4 ] Randyland has played an important role in the cultural rejuvenation of Pittsburgh, with its neighbors City of Asylum and Mattress Factory . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Randyland has received international attention through viral listicles , and [ 8 ] [ 9 ] is among the most photographed places on Instagram . [ 10 ] History [ edit ] Randy Gilson talking to visitors at Randyland Randy Gilson was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania . Early in life he suffered from homelessness and poverty. He moved to Pittsburgh's Northside in 1982, where he was a community activist , planting over 800 street gardens and 50 vegetable gardens. [ 11 ] His guerrilla gardening planted vacant lots in Manchester , the Mexican War Streets , and surrounding neighborhoods. [ 12 ] He bought the property that would become Randyland on a credit card for $10,000 in 1995. [ 13 ] Using upcycling, Gilson decorates his home with items such as mannequins, plastic dinosaurs and pink flamingos. The fences display murals with neighbors dancing and smiling. [ 14 ] In late 2016, Gilson's partner David Paul Francis "Mac" McDermott was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer . [ 15 ] Upon hearing the news, Randyland fans raised over $20,000 and sent Gilson and McDermott on their first vacation. The couple visited the Grand Canyon and Hollywood . [ 16 ] Afterwards, Gilson retired from his restaurant job to spend more time with the ailing McDermott. Following the announcement, Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director. [ 11 ] [ 15 ] [ 17 ] The neighborhood around the museum experienced explosive growth in 2016-2019. [ 18 ] Randyland itself reportedly doubled in attendance. [ 19 ] The courtyard was overhauled to accommodate the traffic. Under Conner's curation, the facility embraced being a selfie museum as a vibrant backdrop for photos. [ 20 ] McDermott died on January 10, 2019. [ 19 ] As Gilson's partner, he was posthumously given the title of co-founder. Journalists noted that McDermott may have downplayed his role when alive but was a backbone of the museum. [ 21 ] Later that year, Randyland received the Mayor's Award for Public Art for 2019. Conner left the museum early 2020. [ 20 ] Because it is outdoors, Randyland was one of the only art museums open in Pennsylvania during the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 18 ] Gilson came out of retirement. The Courtyard was changed to a socially distanced playground throughout quarantine. Many of the original murals have been painted over. As of 2022, Randyland is still a free and popular tourist attraction.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: "Society for Contemporary Craft" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Contemporary Craft ( CC ), which was previously known as the Society for Contemporary Craft , presents contemporary art in craft media such as ceramics, metals, fiber, glass, wood, and mixed media by international, national, and regional artists. In 2020, CC relocated from The Strip District to its permanent location on Butler Street in the Lawrenceville neighborhood in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States . The organization offers exhibitions focusing on multi-cultural diversity and social justice., [ 1 ] artist-led, hands-on workshops, and a store featuring handcrafted art objects by artists from across the United States. CC is free admission and open to the public. Between three and four exhibits are displayed annually in CC's main gallery and bring in approximately 35,000 visitors. [ citation needed ] Another 100,000 visit the Satellite Gallery at One Mellon Center that was opened in 1990. This second gallery is located in the Pittsburgh Steel Plaza T-station and allows those working downtown the opportunity to experience art. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] CC is nonprofit, aiming to bring arts to the community. [ citation needed ] It provides as much free access and programs as possible. In addition to the current exhibits and various studio workshops, CC reaches out into the community and focuses on at-risk youth, seniors in assisted living, and those living in homeless shelters. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] CC was founded in 1971 by Elizabeth Rockwell Raphael [ 5 ] [ 6 ] in the belief that contemporary artists had new things to say with traditional materials, and that they needed wider opportunities to exhibit and sell their work.  Since then, CC has organized more than 230 exhibitions and has established a satellite gallery [ 7 ] and a permanent collection. CC also offers a range of studio classes, community outreach programs, and a retail store. Elizabeth “Betty” Rockwell Raphael, who has been called one of the most groundbreaking women in the arts [ 2 ] was the first to transform the Pittsburgh arts scene. Before its foundation in 1971, Raphael opened a small art gallery in 1941 making the first modern art gallery Pittsburgh had ever seen. She introduced a new vision of art to the city and created what is now one of the only organizations in the country that focuses solely on craft media. [ 7 ] In 2010, CC was named a "Champion in Action" in the community arts category by Citizens Bank and WPXI-TV , and received a $25,000 grant for “offering cutting-edge exhibitions focused on multicultural diversity and non-mainstream art, as well as a range of classes and community outreach programs,” said Ralph J, Papa, Chairman of Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania. [ 4 ] In 2018, CC received the Award of Distinction from American Craft Council . This award recognizes an organization, institution, corporation, or individual who has made significant contributions to the field of craft with a minimum of 25 years of service. [ 8 ] CC was the first organization to receive this award in Pittsburgh, PA. [ citation needed ] References [ edit ] ^ "The Society for Contemporary Craft" . Pittsburgh City Paper .

It is the largest memorial in the United States that is dedicated solely to honoring all branches of military veterans and service personnel. History and notable features [ edit ] This historic building was conceived by the Grand Army of the Republic during the 1890s as a way for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County residents to honor the dwindling ranks of American Civil War veterans; it was built on what had served as a Union Army mustering ground during the war. The memorial now represents all branches of the service and honors career and citizen soldiers who have served the United States throughout its history. Architect Henry Hornbostel designed this memorial in 1907. Dedicated in 1910, the building was created in the Beaux-Arts style and is heroic in scale. It is located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh at 4141 Fifth Avenue (although the walkway leading to its main entrance is signed as " Matthew Ridgway Blvd." in honor of the World War II and Korean War hero who called Pittsburgh home). Situated adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh campus and its Cathedral of Learning , the building is set back from Fifth Avenue. It features expansive, well-kept lawns with large cannons and other war implements. The side streets flanking the building are Bigelow Boulevard and University Place, with O'Hara Street directly behind the memorial. It houses rare and one-of-a-kind exhibits that span the eras from the American Civil War to present-day conflicts. Since 1963, it has been home to the "Hall of Valor," an exhibit that honors individual veterans from the region who went above and beyond the call of duty. The hall currently pays tribute to more than six hundred honorees, including winners of the Medal of Honor , The Kearny Cross , the Distinguished Service Cross , the Navy Cross , the Air Force Cross , the Silver Star , and the Distinguished Flying Cross . The building houses an auditorium that seats 2,500, a banquet hall, meeting rooms, and a museum. The expansive lawn of the memorial sits on top of an underground parking garage operated under a long-term lease by the University of Pittsburgh. It has served as host for many city, civic, university, and business events, including an April 25, 1978, Gulf Oil Corporation shareholders meeting. [ 4 ] Filming location [ edit ] The 1991 psychological horror film Silence of the Lambs features the hall as the Memphis Courthouse, where the film's villain, Hannibal Lecter is kept in a makeshift cell. [ 5 ] The 2009 horror film Sorority Row uses the hall as the site of a graduation. [ 6 ] Famous visitors [ edit ] Ferdinand Foch visited the hall in 1921. [ 7 ] Garner Ted Armstrong of The World Tomorrow spoke at The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall on March 25, 1978. [ 8 ] G. E.

Museum: Stephen_Foster_Memorial
United States historic place Stephen Collins Foster Memorial U.S. Historic district Contributing property Pennsylvania state historical marker Pittsburgh Landmark – PHLF Stephen Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh Location Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA Coordinates 40°26′38″N 79°57′10″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.44382°N 79.95275°W ﻿ / 40.44382; -79.95275 Built 1935–1937 Architect Charles Klauder Architectural style Gothic Revival Part of Schenley Farms Historic District ( ID83002213 [ 1 ] ) Significant dates Added to NRHP July 22, 1983 [ 1 ] Designated PHMC December 1, 1958 [ 2 ] Designated PHLF 1973 [ 3 ] The Stephen Collins Foster Memorial is a performing arts center and museum which houses the Stephen Foster Archives at the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, USA . It is dedicated to the life and works of American songwriter Stephen Foster . It is a contributing property to the Schenley Farms National Historic District , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] is designated as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historical Landmark , [ 3 ] [ 6 ] and is a landmark whose significance is designated by a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Historical Marker . [ 7 ] It is located along Forbes Avenue in the Oakland neighborhood on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as Pitt. The main structure houses the two theaters that serve as performance spaces for the university's Department of Theatre Arts : the 478-seat Charity Randall Theatre and 151-seat Henry Heymann Theatre. The left wing of the building houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum and the Center for American Music which contains the University of Pittsburgh's Stephen Foster Collection and archive that includes manuscripts, copies of over 200 of his musical compositions, examples of recordings, songsters, broadside, programs, books, various memorabilia, and several musical instruments, including one of Foster's pianos. [ 8 ] The memorial is also home to the university's Ethelbert Nevin Collection [ 9 ] and the Society for American Music . [ 10 ] Building [ edit ] Fred Kelly Lobby Charity Randall Theatre Foster shrine entrance hallway and Charles Connick stained glass Interior of the Stephen Foster Shrine The Stephen Foster Memorial, dedicated in 1937, is a steel-framed structure faced with the same Indiana Limestone used for the university's Cathedral of Learning . [ 11 ] It is one of two buildings, the other being Heinz Memorial Chapel , designed by its architect, Charles Klauder , to accompany his centerpiece Cathedral of Learning on the gothic revival portion of the university's campus. The W.F. Trimble & Son's Company was contracted to help erect the building on March 2, 1935. [ 8 ] It was constructed using 35,000 cubic feet (990 m 3 ) of Indiana limestone, 400 tons (360,000 kg) of steel, and 2,500 cubic yards (1,900 m 3 ) of concrete. [ 8 ] In 2003, a $3.2 million renovation of the Stephen Foster Memorial, focusing on its theater facilities, was completed by Colker and Tom Wiley of Pittsburgh's WTW Architects. [ 12 ] The stone courtyard that is adjacent to the rear of the memorial, and sits between it and the south entrance to the Cathedral of Learning, is dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly and is named in his honor. [ 12 ] On the grounds of the memorial, near the Foster Shrine pavilion, sits a sundial on a stone base, currently missing its gnomon , [ 13 ] that was dedicated May 1914 to the Pittsburgh Blues of the War of 1812 by the Dolly Madison Chapter, U.S. Daughters of 1812 . The sun dial was rededicated there on May 9, 1941. [ 14 ] The memorial building houses two theaters and, connected via a hallway, a memorial shrine dedicated to displaying items from the university's Foster Hall Collection. The Stephen Foster Memorial serves as the home for the Society for American Music and the University of Pittsburgh's Center for American's Music which encompasses a research library, archive and museum dedicated to expanding and documenting knowledge of American music and its role in American life. Fred Kelly Lobby [ edit ] The Fred Kelly Lobby, which serves as the lobby/foyer of the Charity Randall Theatre, is entered through the memorial's main Forbes Avenue-facing double red doors and contains two rectangular chandeliers by master metalworker Samuel Yellin of Philadelphia . The lobby also contains Charles Connick stained glass windows depicting Shakespeare (misspelled "Shakespere") and Beethoven that are dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly. [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The 2003 renovation of the memorial added new pieces of furniture to the lobby/foyer which including an octagonal upholstered banquette , a ticket and concession stand, as well as a new wrought iron ring wheel chandelier . These three additions were designed by Pittsburgh architect Michael Chirigos whose work was inspired by the memorial's Gothic arches. The banquette's seats enclose arched cabinets showcasing playbills for future productions along with college and career memorabilia associated with Gene Kelly 's youngest brother, Fred. Both Kellys were Pitt graduates, and it was Fred who taught Gene and many others to dance. The display's cost was underwritten by Fred Kelly's family as an honor to his achievements as an influential choreographer who later became a pioneering television producer and director. The lobby also commemorates outstanding Pitt Theater alumni who are recipients of Department of Theatre Art's annual Fred Kelly Award. [ 15 ] Charity Randall Theatre [ edit ] The main 478-seat traditional proscenium theater, formerly known as the Foster Memorial Theatre, [ 16 ] was renamed as the Charity Randall Theatre following a $2 million renovation in 2003. The theater was reconditioned to bring it up to code, update its equipment, and replicate the original conditions of the auditorium's features. These renovations were undertaken with donations from the Charity Randall Foundation which was established in 1977 to remember the sister of Pitt graduate and businessman Robert Randall and to support her interest in the arts after her death in a car accident. [ 15 ] The plush, deep red seats, identical to those first installed New York 's Radio City Music Hall , were reupholstered and their wrought iron frames and oak arms refinished to their original 1930s condition. [ 12 ] The number of seats were reduced from 572 to 478, including the addition of 24 new freestanding balcony seats. Other auditorium improvements include new carpeting and new lighting that highlights the vaulted stone ceiling, as well as a restoration of the original Samuel Yellin designed chandelier. [ 15 ] In addition, state-of-the-art sound, lighting, and production equipment was added, as well as a new rigging system, actors' restroom, and various stage improvements. [ 17 ] Henry Heymann Theatre [ edit ] The downstairs of the memorial houses the 153-seat Henry Heymann Theatre, featuring a thrust stage with seating on three sides. The theater honors the university's longtime scenic designer, and theater donor, Henry Heymann, who taught scenic design from 1968 until he retired in 1993. [ 16 ] The Heymann Theatre was created in 2000 in a space that formerly served as the memorial's social room, which hosted USO dances during World War II . A little-known tunnel also extends from the Heymann Theatre to under the loading dock level of the Cathedral of Learning, connecting the two buildings. [ 18 ] During the 2003 renovations to the memorial, the downstairs dressing room area was reconfigured to accommodate three "star" dressing rooms and men's and women's showers. Another basement room serves as headquarters for the still-active Tuesday Musical Club, which initiated the original idea and drive for the construction of the Stephen Foster Memorial. [ 15 ] Foster Shrine [ edit ] The left wing, composed of the pavilion of the Foster Shrine, is entered from the left of the building's foyer, which serves as the lobby of the Charity Randall Theatre, and through an entrance corridor that features Foster artifacts, a Foster bust, and five small casement windows featuring Connick stained glass windows devoted to symbols of Stephen Foster and his songs. [ 19 ] Moving along the corridor to the shrine, on the right is the entrance to the Foster Reading Room and library, which is home to much of the Foster collection, including its more fragile contents, that can be examined by appointment. Continuing on, the corridor opens into a 12-sided gothic chamber with lancet windows containing Connick stained glass medallions which illustrate various Foster songs. [ 15 ] On display in the Shrine in and around Gothic-arched alcoves are Foster's piano, sheet music, broadsides , recordings, and other personal items and memorabilia. [ 20 ] The 2003 renovation left the memorial shrine untouched, except for the addition of an unobtrusive fire suppression systems. [ 15 ] History [ edit ] Stephen Foster (1826–1864), the center's namesake The memorial's double red doors The memorial itself was conceived in 1927 when the Tuesday Musical Club, founded in 1889 by affluent female musicians, and University of Pittsburgh Chancellor John Bowman agreed to collaborate on a performance hall dedicated to Stephen Foster that would house the club's recitals. [ 21 ] Bowman donated land adjacent to where the foundation for the Cathedral of Learning was being laid for the memorial. However, little progress on the memorial was made until 1932 when Bowman learned of Josiah Kirby Lilly's Foster Hall Collection. After Lilly pledged more than 10,000 Foster items, fund-raising began in earnest, with almost half the $550,000 cost coming from Lilly and his son, Eli . [ 15 ] Construction began January 13, 1935, the 71st anniversary of Foster's death. A dedication ceremony took place on June 2, 1937, Pitt's 150th anniversary. [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The Foster Hall Collection itself was established in 1930 by Josiah Kirby Lilly , noted for being the president of the prominent Indianapolis pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company . The collection originally began as a retirement hobby based upon his lifelong love of Stephen Foster' s music, but it eventually grew into one of the major collections of American music and history. Lilly and his staff, with the help of some of Foster's relatives, as well as through contributions prompted by the publication of the Foster Hall Bulletin, accumulated over 10,000 Foster items. This initial collection was housed in Indianapolis in a small limestone building he called "Foster Hall." Before his effort began, there had been no exact knowledge concerning the total number of Foster's works, nor any accurate literature published about the composer. Foster Hall's staff identified 201 original works, and Foster Hall became a resource center for John Tasker Howard's biography Stephen Foster: America's Troubadour (1934). Concerned about the future of his collection, Lilly donated the Foster Hall's holdings to the University of Pittsburgh's new Stephen Foster Memorial and the collection was moved to its new home in 1937. Since then, some additional 20,000 items reflecting Foster, composers influenced by him, and music in American life have been added. [ 22 ] The university's Center for American Music also houses the Ethelbert Nevin Collection, which was previously housed in the Theodore M. Finney Music Library until 1999. The Nevin Collection was acquired by the University of Pittsburgh between 1933 and 1956. The materials in the collection were either purchased or donated by Mrs. Ethelbert Nevin, other family members, and friends. The collection consists of original manuscripts, letters, mementos, furnishings, printed matter, and special gifts. [ 9 ] Aside from maintaining the collections and museum, The Center for American Music's projects include Voices Across Time , a curriculum support package that allows teachers to integrate historic American Music into their classrooms. The center also has undertaken Resources of American History II that will provide global online access to music scores, papers, sound recordings, and other American music-related materials in its archives.

Donations vary from booze, former pets now preserved in jars, to killing implements. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] History [ edit ] The Miriellos acquired the victorian property which became Trundle Manor in 2007. Their fascination with Goth, Steampunk and classic horror films, led the couple to amass a private collection of oddities. The couple’s intrigue with the macabre began in their respective childhoods. [ 7 ] [ 5 ] Mr. Arm recalls, "I’ve been collecting since I was a little kid". [ 4 ] They opened their collection, and house, to the public for tours in 2009. It attracts thousands a year as it has been prominently featured as place of interest in Pittsburgh. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Trundle Manor was featured on “MTV’s Extreme Cribs” in 2011. [ 2 ] [ 6 ] [ 11 ] Apart from giving tours, Trundle Manor also organizes and takes part in various events. It often hosts taxidermy classes, art, and comedy shows. [ 5 ] [ 12 ] They have taken their collection on the road as a traveling 'creep show'. [ 1 ] [ 13 ] Exhibits [ edit ] Olivia's Singing Tumor [ edit ] Olivia’s Singing Tumor is the centerpiece of their human reliquary. It features a large benign tumor encased in a glass jar with a musical contraption that makes it “sing.” The said tumor was donated by a belly dancer who gave it to the couple on the condition that it be put on display.

Historic building at the University of Pittsburgh This article is about the University of Pittsburgh academic building and gallery. For others, see Frick Art & Historical Center and Frick Collection . United States historic place Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Building U.S. Historic district Contributing property The Frick Fine Arts Building at the University of Pittsburgh sits behind the Schenley Fountain Coordinates 40°26′30.11″N 79°57′4.50″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.4416972°N 79.9512500°W ﻿ / 40.4416972; -79.9512500 Built 1962–1965 Architect Burton Kenneth Johnstone Architectural style Neo-Renaissance Part of Schenley Farms Historic District ( ID83002213 [ 1 ] ) Added to NRHP July 22, 1983 The Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Building is a landmark Renaissance villa and a contributing property to the Schenley Farms-Oakland Civic Historic District [ 2 ] [ 3 ] on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States . The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the southern edge of Schenley Plaza , opposite The Carnegie Institute , and is the home of Pitt's History of Art and Architecture Department, Studio Arts Department, and the Frick Fine Arts Library. Before its front steps is Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain . History [ edit ] Henry Clay Frick portrait by Malvina Hoffman on the facade of the building The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the site of the former Schenley Park Casino , Pittsburgh's first multi-purpose arena with an indoor ice skating rink, sat on the location of the building before burning down in December 1896. [ 4 ] The building itself is a gift of Helen Clay Frick (1888–1984), daughter of the Pittsburgh industrialist and art patron Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919). She established the Fine Arts Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1926 and continued to fund it through the 1950s, when she first made a commitment to create a separate structure to house it. [ 5 ] Land for the project was donated to the university by the City of Pittsburgh. In early negotiations with the University of Pittsburgh, Miss Frick asked that successors to the New York architects Carrère and Hastings design the new facility after the Italian palazzo its firm had built in Manhattan for her father some fifty years earlier. Eventually, however, both parties agreed to Burton Kenneth Johnstone Associates as the architects. Its design is modeled after Pope Julius III 's (1487–1555) Villa Giulia in Rome, Italy . The building is constructed of white limestone and marble with a terracotta tile roof around a central courtyard. An octagonal cupola, which caps the central rotunda, rises 45 feet above the ground. [ 5 ] The building houses the University of Pittsburgh's Department of History of Art and Architecture and Department of Studio Arts, and contains classrooms, an open cloister, an art gallery, a 200-seat auditorium, as well as a research library. Construction began in 1962 and the building was opened in May 1965. By the late 1960s Miss Frick, unhappy that the university did not conform to her restrictions on management of both the department and the new building, severed her ties with the University of Pittsburgh. She responded by creating a new venture, The Frick Art Museum , on the property of her ancestral home, Clayton, a few miles east in Pittsburgh's Point Breeze neighborhood. That museum operates today as a part of the Frick Art & Historical Center complex. Building use and features [ edit ] The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister of Frick Fine Arts Building Today, the Frick Fine Arts Building consists of classrooms, art studios, a library, and art galleries around an open cloister and contains a 45 feet (14 m) high octagon capped by a pyramidal roof. [ 6 ] A noted 1965 low relief portrait of Henry Clay Frick by Malvina Hoffman in limestone sits above the entrance to the building. Hoffman was 79 years old when she accepted the commission. She could not sculpt it herself because union rules prevented sculptors from working on a relief attached to a building. However, she climbed up on the scaffolding to oversee the completion of the work. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Inside the main entrance, a neon work by contemporary Chinese artist Gu Wenda is installed in the lobby. [ 9 ] The building also contains a 200-seat auditorium that is used for lectures, performances, and special events. [ 10 ] Nicholas Lochoff Cloister [ edit ] The Frick Fine Arts Library The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister is a main feature of the Frick Fine Arts Building. Its large paintings of Italian masterpieces are scale reproductions that were commissioned in 1911 from Nicholas Lochoff by the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts (now the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts ). Lochoff worked slowly and carefully. Only a few paintings were completed and sent back to Russia by the Russian Revolution of 1917 . Lochoff, unable to return because of new communist regime, felt compelled to sell off the paintings. Buyers included Harvard University and the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. Miss Frick acquired the entire collection, however, after Lochoff's death, with the help of art critic Bernard Berenson . In 2003, the paintings were cleaned and restored by Christine Daulton. Also in the gallery are noted Carrara marble reproductions of 14th century Annunciation figures by sculptor Alceo Dossena . [ 11 ] Frick Fine Arts Library [ edit ] Located in Frick Fine Arts Building, this two-story library houses a circulating research collection serving the Departments of the History of Art and Architecture and Studio Arts. The Collection contains over 90,000 volumes and subscribes to more than 350 journals in relevant fields and is ranked among the top 10 fine art libraries in the country. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The library's reading room is constructed of fruit wood paneling and cabinetwork with gold leaf trim designed by Italian craftsmen.  The library is further appointed by wrought iron balcony railings, terracotta tile flooring, maple tables with matching Windsor chairs, and ceiling-high windows furnishing views of Schenley Park .  An inscription on the wall facing the entrance indicates the libraries dedication to Henry Clay Frick . [ 5 ] University Arts Gallery [ edit ] Entrance to the University Arts Gallery flanked by marble Dossena statues The permanent collection contains a collection of prints and graphic works dating from the 16th through 20th centuries and regularly hosts changing exhibitions sponsored by the Department of the History of Art and Architecture and the Friends organization.  Some of the more prominent pieces in the permanent collection include a large collection of Jacques Callot and Gertrude Quastler prints;  16th-18th century drawings from the Clapp and Denny families; a collection of 19th and 20th century photography; the Gimbel collection of American art; and various Japanese prints, Asian ceramics, portraits, and Pittsburgh-related paintings by Hetzel, Gorson, and Kane.

Salk Hall from the rear Jonas Salk Hall at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pennsylvania state [ 2 ] and Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark. [ 3 ] The Art Deco building is named after Jonas Salk , who conducted his research on the first polio vaccine in a basement laboratory while on the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh . [ 4 ] Jonas Salk in 1955 holds bottles of a culture used to grow polio vaccines History [ edit ] The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city owned Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city.  It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz. [ 5 ] The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration . [ 6 ] The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city.  Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt's School of Public Health . [ 7 ] In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($14.6 million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall.  For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students.  Pitt remodeled it to house the School of Dental Medicine and School of Pharmacy in 1961-1962. [ 8 ] Annex [ edit ] The Salk Hall Annex, a major renovation and three-story addition designed by the architectural firm Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel [ 9 ] for the Dental School, was completed the Terrace Street side of the building in 1967 [ 10 ] for a cost of over $5 million ($49.9 million today). [ 11 ] Today, it serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and the dental clinics. A new $50.6 million ($73 million today) addition and renovation to Salk Hall was announced in January 2010. [ 12 ] It will include the construction of an 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m 2 ) research tower in the parking area behind the existing building by Ballinger Architects with associates DRS Architects. The new tower is planned to house laboratories and support spaces relocated from their current home in Salk Hall in order to free up space for additional classrooms and offices in the original structure. [ 13 ] The target completion date is July, 2014. Dental Museum [ edit ] A dental museum is housed in the first floor reception area of Salk Hall. The museum contains a variety of original dental artifacts, including a c. 1910 dental chair, and x-ray machine and instrument cabinet from the 1920s. [ 14 ] Pharmacy Museum [ edit ] Also contained in Salk Hall is the Elmer H. Grimm Sr. Pharmacy Museum, [ 15 ] which opened in the fall of 1996.  Located on the fourth floor, the museum holds pharmacy memorabilia such as drug products, equipment, and sundry products dating back to the early 20th century.  Among the museum's possessions are two hand-carved finials , which were often found over the door or partitions that separated the main part of the pharmacy from the back room where pharmacists did most of their work, an old-fashioned powder mill , and a konseal machine.

Named after U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III (1938–1991) from Pennsylvania, it is located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh . The Heinz History Center is a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m 2 ) [ 2 ] educational institution "that engages and inspires a diverse audience with links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection." [ 3 ] In 2024, the Heinz History Center was named the best history museum in the United States by readers of USA Today as part of their annual Readers' Choice poll. [ 4 ] Senator John Heinz History Center [ edit ] The Heinz History Center seen from the Strip District in Pittsburgh in July 2007 In 1879, a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania was founded. In 1884, leaders changed the organization's name to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania (HSWP); it has been operating continuously since then and is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization. [ 3 ] HSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of steamboat navigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955, it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. During its early years, HSWP leaders held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, were granted space for the organization's archives at the new Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood. [ 3 ] By 1914, HSWP had its own building on Bigelow Boulevard. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip District . [ 3 ] The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by hosting an inaugural gala there on April 26, 1996, for 900 guests. [ citation needed ] In 2004, the Smithsonian wing was completed, adding a gallery for changing exhibitions from the Smithsonian Institution , a Special Collections Gallery, an Education Center, and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum. [ 5 ] The History Center is named for John Heinz , a former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash. [ 2 ] Architecture [ edit ] The century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted by the Pittsburgh office of the architecture firm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson , who did the design and oversaw construction. The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is an exhibit in its own right. [ 6 ] Interior and contents [ edit ] The History Center features the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Detre Library & Archives, and six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania. [ 7 ] The History Center features permanent exhibitions including: Pittsburgh: A Tradition of Innovation - celebrates 250 years of Western Pennsylvania's significant contributions to the world, from Dr. Jonas Salk 's discovery of the polio vaccine to the invention of the Big Mac .

[ 10 ] From Slavery to Freedom - explores more than 250 years of African American history, from 18th century Africa to 21st century Western Pennsylvania. [ 11 ] Rediscovering Lewis & Clark: A Journey with the Rooney Family - traces the path of Lewis and Clark's expedition beginning in Pittsburgh. [ 12 ] Glass: Shattering Notions - showcases Pittsburgh's reign as America's "glass city" and the history of the region’s first industry. [ 13 ] Heinz - chronicles the history of the H.J. Heinz Company. [ 14 ] Visible Storage - provides a behind-the-scenes look at more than 1,200 objects in the museum's collection.

[ 16 ] The gallery also features original set pieces and props from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood , which was filmed in Pittsburgh.

The "museum within a museum" captures the Pittsburgh region's evolution and influence as a sports leader over more than a century, from amateur to pro and across the spectrum of sports. The Sports Museum captures tales of Pittsburgh sports through hundreds of artifacts, more than 70 hands-on interactive exhibits, and 20 audio-visual programs. Select artifacts include Franco Harris ' " Immaculate Reception " cleats; Mario Lemieux 's hockey skates; Satchel Paige 's baseball glove; the pitching rubber from the 1960 World Series; Billy Conn 's boxing gloves and light heavyweight champion belt; Arnold Palmer 's sweater and golf bag; Chip Ganassi 's 2000 Indy 500-winning race car; the "Ultimate Steelers Fan's Car;" the Homestead women swimmers Olympic medals from the 1920s and 1930s; and hundreds of Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cards .

[ 20 ] The site also includes a recreated 16th century Monongahela Indian Village and 1770s Frontier Trading Post. [ 21 ] Adjacent to the Rockshelter is a historic village featuring 19th century structures relocated to the site.
