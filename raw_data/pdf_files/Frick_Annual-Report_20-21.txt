THE FRICK PITTSBURGH
2020–2021 ANNUAL REPORT

A Year of Gratitude
Looking back on the momentous fiscal year 
that began on April 1, 2020—marked by the 
global pandemic of Covid-19, the national 
reckoning with racial justice, the launch of 
our new Strategic Plan, the 30th anniversary 
of Clayton’s restoration and public opening, 
and the 50th anniversary of The Frick Art 
Museum’s founding—we have much to be 
thankful for. 
You, our members and visitors, found new 
ways to engage with the Frick—through 
online programming and the extended 
opening of our garden site—even during 
periods when our museum buildings were 
closed (from March 16 to August 15, 2020, 
and November 21, 2020, to January 23, 
2021). As the museums reopened (initially, 
with admission capped at 10%), you were 
patient with our new safety measures, 
including timed reservations and face mask 
requirements. 
When all of our income streams—from 
investments, donations, and sales—faced 
precipitous declines, our dedicated team 
shouldered tiered salary reductions and 
deep budget reductions. 
Foundations and regional 
funders provided leadership 
support for our essential 
operations when we needed 
it most. Our Board stepped 
forward with additional 
donations that allowed the 
early restoration of staff 
salaries. Individuals whose 
circumstances allowed renewed 
their memberships and made 
additional gifts. Thank you, all. 
As the pages that follow reveal, 
the Frick has emerged from this year a more 
flexible, humble, and socially committed 
organization. We concluded the year without 
a deficit, ahead of schedule in our strategic 
plan, and focused on opportunities to serve 
full-heartedly our entire community, including 
visitors of color who haven’t previously 
thought of the Frick as a place for them. 
Thank you. We look forward to seeing much 
of you in the year ahead.
Elizabeth E. Barker, Ph.D. 
Executive Director

A Reckoning
WHEN WE REFLECT ON 2020,
the murder of George Floyd and the 
groundswell in the movement for racial 
justice come front of mind. 
At the Frick, this groundswell prompted 
our staff and Board to look inward, at 
ourselves as individuals and at the activities 
and structures of our institution. Guided 
by our Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and 
Inclusion (DEAI) consultant, Cecile Shellman, 
we recognized ways in which we have 
participated in structures of oppression—and 
we committed to change. As the first steps on 
our journey to become an actively anti-racist 
organization, we pledged: 
1.	 to support the Black Lives Matter 
movement and its commitment “to 
create space for Black imagination and 
innovation”;
2.	 to cultivate a staff and Board that 
oppose all discrimination and are 
actively anti-racist; 
3.	 to create an environment of physical and 
psychological safety for our Black staff 
and visitors; 
4.	 to require that selection pools of 
prospective employees and vendors 
include qualified Black and other diverse 
candidates; 
5.	 to publish a diversity audit of our 
collections and establish diversity goals 
for acquisitions;
6.	 to consult with Black stakeholders 
to shape relevant programs, 
communications, and activities;
7.	 to expand our professional networks to 
include diverse organizations; and
8.	 to develop strategies to diversify our 
leadership and Board.
We then set to work on enacting these 
commitments. We completed a psychometric 
assessment of our intercultural fluency, 
which captured the work ahead and our 
hunger to reach our goals. We began to 
update our recruiting and purchasing 
practices, and merged the Governance and 
DEAI committees of our Board. 
In the fall, we examined the social and 
economic conditions in which our collection 
and institution were formed in the exhibition 
The Frick Reflects: Looking Back, Moving 
Forward. In 2021, we welcomed Vanessa 
German to a three-year artist residency; her 
first installation, Reckoning: Grief and Light, 
features memorial altarpieces to Breonna 
Taylor, George Floyd, and Elijah McClain, 
and casts museums as spaces of public 
reckoning and social healing.
Outside the galleries, we forged new 
partnerships, including with the youth 
violence prevention program Voices Against 
Violence and the multidisciplinary women 
artists’ group #notwhite Collective. We 
crafted an organizational DEAI statement 
to further define our commitments.
A commitment to anti-racism redefined 
our institution this year, and public 
accountability is a part of that commitment. 
We will continue to share updates in future 
annual reports.
Following a procession from the ArtHouse in 
neighboring Homewood to The Frick Art Museum terrace, 
Artist-in-Residence Vanessa German leads a performance 
inspired by Mende funeral rights in honor of Black and 
indigenous people whose lives have been lost to violence.

The Frick, along with August Wilson African American Cultural Center, 
Fallingwater, Mattress Factory, and The Westmoreland Museum of 
American Art, was jointly awarded a $200K grant from the Richard 
King Mellon Foundation to develop and implement a new virtual 
tour technology created by students at Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Center for Entertainment Technology. 
Our annual RADical Day in recognition of the continued support 
of the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD) typically includes 
large crowds, free exhibition admission, a Clayton open house, 
and family art activities. This year, the Frick turned itself inside 
out online by giving virtual audiences a peek at spaces typically 
unseen by the public, including collections storage, the Clayton 
Vault, the Playhouse bowling alley, and a many-compartmented 
17th-century cabinet that belonged to Mr. Frick.
Inspired by the Frida Kahlo exhibitions on view 
at The Frick Art Museum, the multicultural 
women's artist group #notwhite Collective 
kicked off a live Saturday cooking series 
sharing family stories, photos, and recipes 
from their cultures on the Frick’s Instagram.

Like many homeowners, we did some improvement projects this year. On the landing of 
Clayton’s front porch stairs, O.A. Bertin Company reset terrazzo pieces conserved by McKay 
Lodge Art Conservation Laboratory in 2018, color-matched and poured new terrazzo where 
necessary, and—finally—ground, polished, and sealed the mosaic. Upstairs, storm windows 
protecting the stained glass windows of Mrs. Frick’s bathroom were reglazed, and a new project 
involving the Juliet balcony, roof, and dormer above Mr. Frick's bathroom began. Lead paint 
remediation, metal restoration, and masonry repair are underway.
The Frick welcomed Homewood-based artist Vanessa German for a three-year residency 
beginning in March 2021 with Reckoning: Grief and Light, an immersive, multisensory 
installation in our Italian gallery. Three altarpieces elegizing George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, Elijah McClain, and other lives ended at the hands of police face Renaissance 
devotional paintings. Selections from Unburied, Unmourned, Unmarked: Requiem for Rice, 
a contemporary symphony about the history of Africans enslaved on Lowcountry South 
Carolina and Georgia rice plantations, accompanies.

As Mr. Frick amassed an impressive 
collection of paintings in the early 
20th century, he sought decorative 
arts of the same renown for his 
homes, acquiring a large collection 
of Chinese porcelains from the 
Qing Dynasty period (1644–1912) 
to decorate both Clayton and his 
summer estate, Eagle Rock.

In conjunction with our institutional anniversaries, our Curatorial staff took a critical look at 
the social context in which the Frick family lived; the perspective with which Helen Clay Frick 
founded our institution; and the values and viewpoints her collection reveals in The Frick 
Reflects: Looking Back, Moving Forward. Turning the spotlight on rarely seen objects, this 
project considered the collection—assembled in privileged and turbulent circumstances—
from new perspectives, including those of our own time, exploring how museums, curators, 
and visitors participate in the construction of knowledge, meaning, and memory.

 FIRST-TIME SCHOOLS
In the spring of 2020, the Frick expected 
to welcome thousands of students into our 
museums and classrooms. Instead, we found 
ourselves in a new world where schools were 
closed and students were learning from 
home. Continuing to serve local schools and 
other longstanding community partners, 
even when in-person museum programming 
was not possible, became our priority.
Frick museum educators delved 
wholeheartedly into creating live, 
interactive Digital Learning Experiences 
that were free for all classes. We 
purchased supplies and created art kits 
for students at Pittsburgh Faison K-6; 
made videos to keep our pre-K friends 
at Crescent Early Childhood Center 
learning about color, shape, and line; 
and worked with partner teachers at 
Propel McKeesport and Sterrett Classical 
Academy to create live, virtual museum 
visits that kept students engaged in 
the learning and conversations we 
started together in person earlier in 
the school year. 
Out of challenge can come great opportunity, 
and our new relationship with Voices Against 
Violence, an organization in south Pittsburgh 
whose mission is to reduce interpersonal 
conflict among youth, was one of the 
brightest spots of the year. In the summer 
of 2020, Voices Against Violence summer 
campers visited the Frick and created the 
“Black is Beautiful” outdoor art installation 
that still stands near The Frick Art Museum. 
Since then, our partnership has grown and is 
ready to become a year-round collaboration, 
engaging families as well as youth in shared 
experiences exploring art and history. 
At the time of this report, our Learning team 
is striving to serve our community partners 
in ways that best meet their needs, including 
making outreach visits to schools, supplying 
art materials and lesson plans to classroom 
teachers, engaging students online in virtual 
programs that bring students right into the 
galleries, and welcoming students back to 
the Frick for safe, in-person visits. We stand 
committed to being a place of learning for 
all community partners, and look forward 
to welcoming friends old and new in the 
coming year.

cially-distanced field trip.
The Frick started our fiscal year on April 1, 2020, with our doors closed due to 
Covid-19. Membership sales and earned revenue stopped for several months 
before gradually returning, and philanthropic support dipped as giving was 
appropriately focused on meeting basic human needs. An initial PPP Loan 
enabled us to retain most of our staff, and, as the year continued, we were 
grateful to receive sustaining Covid-19 relief funding from local foundations, 
federal and state government, and friends and supporters like you. Covid-19 
caused delays for our large capital projects, and we anticipate at least a three-
year recovery timeline as we build back to pre-pandemic operating budgets and 
membership participation. With your continued support, the Frick will continue to 
innovate our programs and services as we work toward full recovery.
Despite the significant operational challenges that Covid-19 brought to the organization, 
FY21 ended with a surplus and a renewed focus on implementing the strategic plan. The 
Frick carries no debt aside from a second Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, to be 
utilized and forgiven in FY22. The surplus will be used for capital maintenance projects that 
were planned for but unable to be performed during extended closures. Personnel remain 
our most valuable resource at more than half of the annual budget. The Frick is focused 
on creating fairer employment structures, including shifting 29 hour/week employees to 
full-time. Organizationally, we are ensuring that our enterprises are break-even or profit-
producing and increasing our emphasis on using Minority, Women, and Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprises (MWDBE). Your support sustained the Frick during a challenging 
period, and we thank you.

The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands
of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage,
and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history
and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural
importance of land and the role of cultural
institutions in the formation of collective
memory. Displacement and erasure are
not just histories for native peoples. Land
acknowledgments, like historic sites themselves,
are exercises in preservation and reconciliation,
engaged with past, present, and future.		
Strategic Plan Update
I. ACCESS
A. Welcome Diverse Audiences to the Frick
1.	
Publish a Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion
(DEAI) statement
Our DEAI statement, drafted by our staff DEAI Committee 
and enthusiastically adopted by the Board in June 2021, is an 
early step on our collective journey to becoming an anti-racist 
organization. Read the full text at TheFrickPittsburgh.org/Equity.
2.	 Adopt a Rooney Rule in our hiring practices
After implementing this rule, we recognized its insufficiency. 
In summer 2021, we adjusted our policies to proactively recruit 
candidates of color by adjusting the phrasing and locations of 
job postings.
3.	 Invest in staff training to ensure predictably outstanding 
services for all visitors
In 2020, we began to expand professional development 
opportunities for our team, including workshops in empathy 
and in verbal de-escalation techniques, complimentary 
membership in the American Alliance of Museums, and paid 
access to the Mid-Atlantic Association of Museums annual 
conference. 
4.	 Seek to develop meaningful, long-term partnerships with 
trusted organizations in diverse communities
Drawing on our experience cultivating relationships with local 
schools, in 2020, we began to forge new partnerships with 
community organizations such as Voices against Violence 
(see II.B.3).
5.	 Be mindful of DEAI as we develop acquisitions, exhibitions, 
and programs
In 2020-21, our exciting roster of exhibitions and public 
programs featured contributions from BIPOC, queer, and 
disabled artists, and cast fresh light on the Frick’s own 
institutional origin story. 
6.	 Develop programs for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, 
Black History Month, and Juneteenth
As with the first two goals listed above, this now seems a 
rudimentary step in our larger commitment to anti-racism. In 
2020-21, we recognized Black History Month with a moderated 
discussion of Caste, and arranged to host a Juneteenth 
concert—which was ultimately relocated to Mellon Park when 
anticipated attendance exceeded the capacity of our site. 
7.	
Implement ongoing visitor assessment
Throughout 2020-21, we used flash member surveys, electronic 
assessments from exhibition visitors, and site visit focus groups 
to assess and adjust our services and offerings. 
In March 2020, the Frick adopted the following 38 goals. Together, 
they chart an inclusive, visitor-focused, and sustainable course. Our 
Strategic Plan is adaptable, allowing our team to develop realistic 
work plans in response to changing circumstances as each fiscal 
year approaches. This flexibility served us well this year. Despite 
the serious challenges of Covid-19, as this Annual Report attests, 
we advanced our goals in ways that met our community’s evolving 
needs. Every Annual Report will contain a progress report like the 
following until all our goals are met—at which point, we will share 
new ones.
YEAR 1 OF OUR 7-YEAR PLAN:
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
21% of goals completed 
53% of goals in progress 
26% of goals upcoming

Strategic Goals, 2021–2027

23

B. Ease Navigation of Our Site and Information
1.	
Undertake a comprehensive wayfinding audit and update our 
campus signage accordingly, beginning at the perimeter fence 
Upcoming
2.	 In conjunction with resurfacing the parking lot, remove the 
guard booth and relocate that function, and add electric vehicle 
recharging stations
In 2021, we finalized our plans and commenced Phase 1 
of this project. 
3.	 Implement the site lighting plan to enhance the safety and beauty 
of our campus, while demonstrating leadership in reducing light 
pollution by observing International Dark Sky guidelines
In winter and spring 2021, we presented public programs about 
the dark-sky movement and began Phase 1 of this project (which 
includes the parking lot, mentioned above).
4.	 Overhaul the telephone tree for ease of use
In fall 2020, we implemented a new VoIP (Voice over Internet 
Protocol) phone system and updated the telephone tree. 
5.	 Review the website 
Upcoming
II. INTERPRETATION
A. Align our Interpretative Strategy with our Visitors’ Needs
1.	
Establish a full-time position dedicated to developing and 
overseeing the Frick’s sitewide strategies for interpretation
In spring 2021, Kelsie Paul (former Manager of School Learning) 
became our first Manager of Interpretation & Engagement, 
responsible for developing and leading inclusive experiences that 
actively engage visitors through participation, reflection, and 
connection.
2.	 Establish a culture of continuous assessment of our evolving 
Interpretation Plan in response to the changing needs 
of our visitors
See I.A.7.
3.	 Produce a visitor orientation video
Upcoming
4.	 Expand the menu of guided tours, and explore adding drop-in 
visits to Clayton
In 2020-21, with Clayton closed due to Covid, our docents 
introduced a popular series of outdoor site tours. In the year 
ahead, their focused study and reflection promises to yield fresh 
experiences of Clayton.
5.	 Reopen the Playhouse to the public as a learning space
In 2020, we launched plans to make the ground floor space that 
once housed the Frick children’s bowling alley into a studio for the 
Frick’s artist-in-residence. Periodic programs involving the artist 
and their studio will engage the community with the site. 
6.	 Update and reissue the whole-site souvenir guidebook
In spring 2021, The Art and Life of a Pittsburgh Family was 
updated and reissued after being out of print for several years. 
Look for it at the Frick Museum Store.
C. Attend to Our Visitors’ Human Needs
1.	
Expand our accommodations for people with disabilities, 
including by widening curb cuts, automating entrance doors, 
and creating accessible restrooms in The Frick Art Museum
In 2020-21, we made progress in meeting this multiyear goal by 
finalizing our plans to improve accessibility onto our campus, 
within our parking lot, and on our sidewalks (see B.2-3). 
2.	 Establish a sanitary, safe place for nursing mothers and 
caregivers to breastfeed babies, express breast milk, and 
feed infants
In 2021, we identified a suitable location for this space and set 
in motion plans for its creation.
3.	 Develop viable plans for secondary food service on site for 
visitors not seeking a fine dining experience, such as a coffee 
bar offering prepared food
In summer 2020, Covid conditions prompted a successful 
experiment with carryout Café lunches, which continued 
in spring 2021 from a temporary cart in the Grable Visitor 
Center. The Café at the Frick reopened in summer 2021 with 
a refurbished interior, expanded hours, and an introductory 
menu of casual lunch and coffee bar offerings. (As conditions 
permit, Café services will continue to expand.)
4.	 Consolidate and update the restaurant and pastry kitchens to 
provide such expanded food service
We discontinued the practice of operating separate pastry and 
Café kitchens in 2020. A refurbishment of the Café kitchen is still 
to be developed. 
B. Expand Learning Experiences
for Families with Children
1.	
Develop interpretive, educational 
programs for the Playhouse
Covid prompted new plans for the 
Playhouse (see II.A.5), since its intimate 
scale is ill-suited to social distancing.
2.	 Review Greenhouse programming
Upcoming
3.	 Pilot outdoor art installations
In October 2020, we installed a mixed-media triptych created 
by summer campers from Voices Against Violence near the 
intersection of Reynolds Street and Homewood Avenue.
C. Continuously Assess and Reﬁne the Exhibitions Program
1.	
When possible, extend the duration of temporary exhibitions to 
accommodate expanded programing
Selected exhibitions added to our schedule in 2020-21, such as 
Romare Bearden: Artist as Activist and Visionary (2022), will be 
on view for extended presentations.
2.	 Introduce focused research exhibitions and “pop-up” displays to 
smooth drops in attendance between large shows
Upcoming
3.	 Update the Collection displays, including by reviewing our 
label format and content from the vantage point of our visitors 
Upcoming
4.	 Ensure that all exhibitions and displays are promoted, regardless 
of their location on campus
In 2020, we broadened our marketing beyond “blockbuster” 
exhibitions to include temporary exhibitions at the Car and Carriage 
Museum and single-gallery installations at The Frick Art Museum.

Our Team
‡ ex officio
To help the Frick attract and retain talent, in 2021, we increased our investment in professional 
development, expanded leadership training for our management cohort, and launched a 
multi-year pay initiative that seeks to bring all staff to regional parity for their positions or 
Allegheny County’s living wage, whichever is greater, by the second quarter of 2023.
III. STEWARDSHIP
A. Preserve the Structures and Collections Entrusted to Our Care
1.	
Remediate the lead paint, conserve the structure, and repaint 
the exterior of Clayton
Upcoming
2.	 Complete other repairs, including the Juliet Balcony and Henry 
Clay Frick’s bathroom
In 2020-21, we completed repairs to the terrazzo floor of the 
Clayton porch and embarked on a project to conserve the Juliet 
balcony and bathroom.
3.	 Correct the roof leaks, ﬂuctuating climate conditions, and car lift 
in the Car and Carriage Museum
In 2020 and early 2021, we continued to study the sources of water 
incursion and adjusted our climate control reporting processes. In 
summer 2021, we conducted repairs to the car lift. 
4.	 Undertake a comprehensive assessment of The Frick Art Museum 
and develop and implement a multi-year capital improvement plan
Upcoming
5.	 Update the Collection Development Plan for the art collection
Upcoming
B. Review Certain Activities with an Eye to Sustainability
1.	
Refine and maintain sustainable systems for collecting and 
assessing information about our visitors and operations 
Upcoming
2.	 Assess the museum’s travel program to ensure that it is 
distinctive, economical, and well-managed
Upcoming
3.	 Review the Membership program to ensure that it is meeting our 
members’ needs, helping to expand the group of prospective 
supporters, and financially supporting the needs and mission of 
the organization
In early 2021, we began a new assessment of our membership 
program—a project coinciding with a national decline in museum 
membership during the pandemic.
4.	 Invest in leadership training for our managers and professional 
development for all staff so that we can perform our work 
effectively, efficiently, and with satisfaction
In 2020, as a first step in this process, our 25-person leadership 
cohort completed a three-week course on leading remote teams 
through times of change.
Welcome to our inaugural Burke 
Family Fellow! Alonna Carter 
(center), a graduate student 
in public history at Duquesne 
University, will focus her fellowship 
research on Black experiences 
during the Gilded Age, working 
with Frick Learning and Curatorial 
staff on the development of new 
interpretive tours of Clayton. 
The Burke Family Fellowship was 
established in honor of dedicated 
Frick supporters Charles R. "Chip" 
Burke (left) and Carole King (right).
