Pirates' charitable initiatives
PIRATES CHARITIES
In 2006, under the direction of Chairman, Bob Nutting, the Pirates established Pirates Charities to strengthen our community. Since its inception, Pirates Charities has impacted communities throughout the Pittsburgh region through the development of unique experiences and programs. Through this work, Pirates Charities has created lasting positive impact for athletes with unique abilities, local men and women serving our country, children battling cancer and countless other individuals.
FIELDS FOR KIDS
The Pirates Charities Fields for Kids program presented by Highmark partners with organizations operating youth baseball and/or softball programs to ensure youth athletes have safe places to play.
Since its inception in 2009, the Pirates Charities Fields for Kids Program has distributed 425 individual grants in the greater Pittsburgh region and since 2011, 46 grants in the Pirates Spring Training home of Bradenton, Florida.
MIRACLE LEAGUE SUPPORT
For more than 15 years, Pirates Chairman Bob Nutting and Pirates Charities has been proud to support Miracle League programs in the greater Pittsburgh region and Manatee County, Florida by providing athletes with unique abilities the opportunity to play the sport they love. Over the years, Pirates Charities has partnered with numerous Miracle Leagues to increase accessibility for the game and allow every all-star to play.

In 1979, the Pittsburgh Pirates adopted Sister Sledge's "We Are Family" as their team song, a choice made by team leader Willie Stargell, and it became their official theme song.
