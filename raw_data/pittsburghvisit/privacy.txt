VisitPittsburgh is concerned about your privacy.
We want you to understand what Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you, and how we use your Personally Identifiable Information.
"Personally Identifiable Information" (PII) refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains. This includes information that is used in a way that is personally identifiable, including linking it with identifiable information from other sources, or from which other personally identifiable information can easily be derived, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information. To the extent unique information (which by itself is not Personally Identifiable Information) such as a personal profile, unique identifier, biometric information, and IP address is associated with Personally Identifiable Information, then such unique information is also considered Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.
When you register on our VisitPittsburgh Web Site, we will ask you for certain PII such as, your address, telephone number, and e-mail address. If you use our Request for Proposal option, we will ask you for detailed information regarding your meeting requirements so that responding proposals from our members are on-target with your needs. If you send VisitPittsburgh correspondence, via email, fax, or regular mail, or if other users or third parties such as businesses send us correspondence about your activities in connection with your use of the Web Site, VisitPittsburgh may retain that information. Further, if any third parties provide information to us about you, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
