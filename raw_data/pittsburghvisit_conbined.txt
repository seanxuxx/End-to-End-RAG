## trace-echo-an-uptown-gathering-space-for-coffee-pints-pittsburgh-community
Since early October, there's been a new venue in town with a familiar name, Trace Echo (a Trace offshoot), in a perhaps unexpected part of town ‚Äî Pittsburgh's Uptown neighborhood.
Southeast of the city's Central Business District and across from some colorful row houses, this quaint, new corner venue now welcomes locals to its cozy interior and connected patio with outdoor space (featuring wood stacks, a fire pit and soon-to-come food truck).
The neighborhood, also known as The Bluff, currently seems a contrast of dilapidated buildings and beautiful historic architecture, overgrown lots and vibrant murals. There are a couple budding businesses popping up around, too; Redhawk Coffee Roasters , for example, has an outpost just a few blocks away.
Redhawk Coffee Roasters: https://redhawkcoffee.com/
And then, of course, there‚Äôs Trace Echo . We‚Äôd highly recommend supporting this friendly business by grabbing a coffee to go, served in a clever, compostable-recyclable cup, or sipping an afternoon pint amongst neighbors in an evolving part of the city.
Trace Echo: https://www.tracebloomfield.com/trace-echo
Aadam Soorma, head of marketing and guest experience at Trace Brewing, says the company‚Äôs overarching goal is always community with a focus on inclusion. ‚ÄúA lot of our regulars aren't the types to visit a bunch of breweries,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúWe're their neighborhood spot and third space. We're their coffee shop, meeting place, work-from-home space and gathering place.‚Äù He feels that at Trace they curate a vibe in many ways. But the purposeful and intentional steps taken through programming ‚Äî with events, their bar program and menu selections, plus hiring practices ‚Äî is all geared toward touching diverse communities with the goal of everyone feeling comfortable in their space.
Trace first evolved during COVID when the owners were simply brainstorming about where they envisioned things going once it was safe to gather and host events again. ‚ÄúBut the density of Bloomfield and walkability/bikeability/public transit access was something we thought about,‚Äù Soorma says, ‚Äúand the way that our space could sort of gel with the neighborhood as a part of folks' day to day.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúAlso, our General Manager (Katie Rado) has underrepresented communities in breweries literally at the top of her mind so there was no doubt our events would showcase, celebrate and pay Black, Queer artists and lead the way for other breweries to start thinking about their events strategies.‚Äù
For Trace Echo‚Äôs location, they initially explored spaces in dense, walkable parts of town (like Oakland). Uptown was always in mind too, and when the time felt right, they signed a lease at their current address on Forbes Ave. ‚ÄúIt's positioned right smack between Downtown and Oakland,‚Äù Soorma explains. ‚ÄúIt's a 10-minute walk to PPG Arena for concerts and Penguins games . It's literally two bus stops from Duquesne University and in a part of town that's growing. And [nearby] UPMC Mercy has doctors, nurses and healthcare workers cycling in and out of their facility daily, so it's nice to treat our healthcare friends to coffee and beer. Overall, the Uptown neighborhood seems to be interested in having more spaces to gather and more places to visit. We're excited to be in early and hope to continue getting to know our new neighbors.‚Äù
PPG Arena: https://www.ppgpaintsarena.com/
Penguins games: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/schedule
The beer continues to get brewed at their homebase brewery in Bloomfield, and the team then drives kegs over to Trace Echo. At bar-cafe Echo they‚Äôve then rounded out the menu with some fun, non-beer options as well. ‚ÄúA Few Bad Apples is the only cider we will run at Trace Echo,‚Äù Soorma shares. ‚ÄúIt feels neat to have that as a bit of an 'exclusive' deal. We are excited to offer Two Frays NA beer in cans. We will continue serving Goodlander draft cocktails and Personal Day seltzers too. Pittsburgh Winery options are available too for the wine drinkers.‚Äù There are options for soda and even iced tea, too.
Yet what really makes the Trace Echo offerings ‚Äúpop‚Äù according to Soorma, is what happens before 3 p.m. every day, with Ghost Coffee Collab treating Uptown as their HQ. This means guests have several options for pour over coffee, unique single-origin pulls of espresso and ‚Äúarguably one of the most thoughtful cafe menus in Pittsburgh right now,‚Äù Soorma says. He knows it might seem a little odd, but what makes Trace Echo truly special is the Ghost Coffee collab. ‚ÄúOur relationship with Ghost and our partnership on this space is the manifestation of years of work to dial in a method and a process to truly have two spaces and two brands housed symbiotically under one roof,‚Äù he says.
Ghost Coffee Collab: https://www.ghostcoffeecollab.com/
Soorma‚Äôs favorite part of opening Echo has been getting to know the neighbors. ‚ÄúWith our seven-days-a-week service and our dense, walkable vibe, the neighbors have been a blast to talk to,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI really like Lee at Uptown Mini Mart; he's from Bhutan, grew up in Nepal and will share all kinds of stories about folks who come in to play the lottery every day (he's even had a few big winners)."
They‚Äôve also become friends with Harry at Uptown Kitchen; when they opened, he looked at our menu then looked back at his pizza restaurant and said "WE COMPLETE EACH OTHER!" ‚ÄúThat was a very cute moment,‚Äù Soorma says. He also really appreciates the space‚Äôs natural light, and the overall vibe during cafe hours. ‚ÄúAlso the bus stop out front is the most active bus stop I've ever seen in my life,‚Äù Soorma says.
So far the venue‚Äôs getting nice foot traffic during the lead-up to Penguins games, plus a lovely reception to the coffee program. The Duquesne folks and UPMC Mercy folks have been stopping in for team outings and happy hours, too. ‚ÄúIt's been great,‚Äù Soorma says, ‚Äújust really nice people getting familiar with our staff and our offerings. I'm excited to see what it'll look like when we start throwing events and when our (static) food truck comes on board in 2025."
Current draws include a 'second drink on us' deal for folks en route to a Pens game or a concert at PPG. ‚ÄúIt's an exclusive Trace Echo deal for folks who are en route to the arena,‚Äù Soorma says. Also, they‚Äôre extremely excited about onboarding Sahar's Food Lab ‚Äî an experimental, minority-owned food truck. ‚ÄúSahar and her partner Jeremy run their food truck (they have commitments to several breweries thru the end of 2024),‚Äù Soorma says, ‚Äúand plan to join us as a static, permanent food truck concept at Trace Echo in early 2025. We're very excited to have them working with us.‚Äù

Pittsburgh Area Farmers' Markets and U-Pick Farms
Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets, click here .
If you want to get a little closer to your food, try harvesting your own produce at Pittsburgh area U-Pick Farms . You'll get some exercise as well as a great big bunch of fresh produce you picked yourself. Visiting a u-pick farm is a great family experience that is both fun and educational. There's something about harvesting your own food that makes you appreciate it more. Many U-Pick farms also have on-site stores selling other ready-to-go products from their farm.
Many Pittsburgh area residents enter in to a more formal agreement with local farmers to ensure their seasonal supply of farm fresh products; including farm fresh beef and other meats. This is a relatively new and growing trend called, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) . These agreements, and the products offered, vary by farm and help local families enjoy a variety of farm fresh products while providing local farmers a profitable outlet for their harvest.

Up for more walking?

Sports fans are in luck in Pittsburgh! The city is home to several professional teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers , Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins , and the locals are fanatical for their favorite sports teams . You can find a large area devoted to the teams at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located inside the Senator John Heinz History Museum .
Pittsburgh Steelers: http://www.steelers.com/
Pittsburgh Pirates: http://www.mlb.com/pirates
Pittsburgh Penguins: http://www.nhl.com/penguins
The Heinz History Museum pays tribute to more than the local sports teams. Here, you can learn so much about one of Pittsburgh‚Äôs most famous citizens, Mister Rogers, a national treasure. Find his monogrammed house slippers and one of his beloved red cardigans. The museum also is full of American history following the democracy of the country.

Ride the Duquesne Incline up to the Mount Washington neighborhood for a spectacular view of the city. A quick ride back down will drop you off in the South Side neighborhood.
Pittsburgh is widely known for its three rivers. Tour the city by water aboard the Gateway Clipper Fleet .

And, the sunset cruises are a great option for a romantic night out.
Speaking of those bridges, many of them are easily walkable, connecting Downtown to several of Pittsburgh‚Äôs 90 unique neighborhoods. In fact, the Sixth Street Bridge, commonly known as the Clemente Bridge, directly takes you from Downtown to PNC Park, home of the Pirates.
Consider extending your Pittsburgh visit with a daytrip to the Laurel Highlands , where you can visit two of Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs most iconic homes, Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob . Visiting these residences is like stepping back in time, as the d√©cor reflects the decade each house was built. When available, make sure you book a guided tour, as they provide an insider‚Äôs look at Mr. Wright‚Äôs thought processes, as well as the homeowners‚Äô.
Laurel Highlands: https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/go-laurel-highlands/

From the iconic entrance into the city from the Fort Pitt Tunnel or that first peek at the top of the U.S. Steel Tower when I-279 curves, that ‚Äúparticular brand of magic‚Äù captivates all who see the Steel City for the first and hundredth time.
In what started as a fort built during the French and Indian War, Pittsburgh earned much of its personality today by once being the center of the American steel industry - it‚Äôs where the name of the Steelers came from, after all. The grit that came with working in the steel mills can still be felt in the community, from Fairywood to the East Hills.
If you want to feel integrated as a Pittsburgher, there‚Äôs something special about walking through the City‚Äôs Strip District on a Steelers Sunday. What better way to capture the yinzer spirit than with a Primanti‚Äôs sandwich at the original location in the Strip, stacked high with vinegar-based coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries? We recommend, ironically enough, the Pitts-Burger. Can‚Äôt stomach fries on a sandwich? Then try it on a salad in classic Pittsburgh style. It‚Äôs good for the soul. Whatever your taste, Pittsburgh has something for everyone. Take one of the inclines up Mt. Washington and check out the city skyline from the overlooks before stopping for a bite to eat with a view.

Primanti‚Äôs: https://primantibros.com/
There are some things that are simple must-dos in the Steel City. We‚Äôre called the City of Champions, so check out the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates play during their seasons. Lonely Planet recommends visiting in June , when the winter is over but the humid summer is still on the horizon. It‚Äôs also just in time for the Three Rivers Art Festival . Even if you check everything off your Pittsburgh list, there‚Äôs always something new to discover around every corner. So whether you‚Äôre coming for a Steelers game on the weekend or hunkering down between the three rivers for the winter, we‚Äôre excited to welcome you as an honorary Yinzer.

## how-to-ride-the-pittsburgh-inclines
Inclines, commonly known as Funiculars Railways, can be found all over the world and throughout history.
It's a question we get asked all the time. So, we're giving you the low-down on going up.
These railways are designed to transport people and cargo up and down steep slopes. And if there is one thing Pittsburgh has, it's steep slopes. You've probably noticed the iconic Pittsburgh Inclines that make our skyline so unique.
The Duquesne Incline (pronounced "doo-KANE") has red cars and is visible from The Point, while The Monongahela Incline (commonly called "The Mon Incline") has yellow cars and can be seen from the South Shore.
Duquesne Incline 1197 W. Carson St. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219
Monongahela Incline 8 Grandview Ave., Port Authority of Allegheny County Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15211
Details: https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/monongahela-incline/

Originally opened in the 1870s to service those who lived on Mount Washington, the two inclines that remain in use are the last of four that served the Mt. Washington area . Today, they have become more than just a means of transportation. They are still used by local commuters to enter downtown , but they have evolved into our favorite way to show off the city skyline.
Both inclines cost $2.50 one way . The Mon Incline is $3.50 for a roundtrip ticket, and Duquesne Incline $5 roundtrip with certain discounts for children and senior citizens. Tickets can be purchased at the upper or lower station for both inclines. The Monongahela Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only.
The inclines are public transportation, so Pittsburgh Regional Transit Connect Cards work to pay for a trip as well. If you don't have a Connect Card, the Mon Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only.
Pro Tip: Use the PRT App on your smartphone to buy your Incline tickets. On the App, tickets are $2.75 and valid for unlimited trips for 3 hours total on both Inclines.
The inclines are open 365 days a year and run approximately every 5 minutes. Hours are:
To find these historic landmarks, cross the Monongahela river (the one south of Downtown) by either the Smithfield Street or Fort Pitt Bridge and enter Pittsburgh‚Äôs South Shore. You will find the lower stations of both inclines where you can purchase ride tickets.
The two inclines both scale the side of Mount Washington and both have equally stunning views. We can't tell you which one is better, because we love them both so much! You really can't go wrong with either choice.
Visiting Mount Washington and our Inclines are way more than a great view . The Monongahela Incline lower station is located on East Carson Street near the Smithfield Bridge in Station Square. It is surrounded by restaurants, shops and entertainment. Here, you can park and hop on the Incline to enjoy the stunning city skyline as you rise to Grandview Avenue.
At the upper station on Mt. Washington, you an enjoy scenic lookout platforms or enjoy a walk along Shiloh St. to enjoy DiFiore's ice cream with the kids or a nice lunch at Redbeard's or Coughlin's Law.
Redbeard's: https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/redbeards-bar-grill-1038187-disabled/
The Duquesne Incline is located down the street on W Carson Street just west of the Fort Pitt Bridge in view of Point State Park and has a provided parking lot. This incline carries you to an Observation Deck that USA Today Weekend Magazine described as one of the ‚Äú10 most beautiful views in America.‚Äù
Once you get to the top, you'll find more than an Instagram-worthy vie . Both upper incline stations also provide historical exhibits to browse through while waiting between rides. And why not make a day of it? Strolling around Mt Washington is a great way to spend an afternoon . Be sure to check out some of the awesome dining options!
Pro Tip: Sit at the front of the cable car for the best view of the city. ‚¨áÔ∏è

To the extent unique information (which by itself is not Personally Identifiable Information) such as a personal profile, unique identifier, biometric information, and IP address is associated with Personally Identifiable Information, then such unique information is also considered Personally Identifiable Information.

If you're not sure why fish on Friday is a thing, let me backup a bit. Lent (Mar. 5 - April 17, 2025), is a religious observance by many Christian denominations that covers a period of approximately six weeks before Easter Sunday. During all of the Fridays of Lent, Catholics over the age of 14 abstain from meat and from foods made with meat.
The end result? Places from churches to fire halls, restaurants and bars get in on the Fish Fry fun, offering up colossal fish sandwiches, Only in Pittsburgh pierogies, traditional Polish favorites like haluski and lots of mac-n-cheese, fries and other fried goodies. You don't need to be a member of the church to go, either; just head on in (bring cash) and experience the Pittsburgh Fish Fry for yourself! Home to a thriving culinary scene across various neighborhoods , you'll find a scrumptious array of fried fish offerings throughout Pittsburgh.

## wineries-distilleries
Discover and explore Pittsburgh's unique drinking history!
In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion was in full force because of farmers rebelling against the whisky task which in return made western Pennsylvania a hub for a lot of distilleries during that time. This changed when prohibition came into effect where it made it illegal to produce and sell alcohol. Fast forward to the year 2000, when the whole state of Pennsylvania had only one distillery. Today, there are around 70 in the state with more than a dozen of those located in Allegheny County. Follow this handy map on where to find Pittsburgh spirits, pre-mixed cocktails, wine, cider, mead and more!
