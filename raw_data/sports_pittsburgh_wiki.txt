Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War . Baseball , hockey , and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the "City of Champions" when the Pittsburgh Pirates , Pittsburgh Panthers football team , and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s. [ 1 ] Today, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and Penguins ; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference , the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt 's coat of arms ; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets , wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney , in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins , wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing in Ontario . In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel , which has become "arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team." [ 6 ] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer , Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle , and basketball player Jack Twyman .  Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the "Cradle of Quarterbacks" [ 7 ] [ 8 ] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly , George Blanda , Johnny Unitas , Joe Namath , Dan Marino , and Joe Montana . The hometown Pittsburgh Penguins NHL ice hockey team defeats the Washington Capitals in Game 7 of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs second round en route to winning the Stanley Cup championship two rounds later. As of 2024, this is the most recent major league sports championship won by a Pittsburgh team. Professional team sports [ edit ] The City of Pittsburgh has had various professional sports franchises throughout its history and today is home to three teams competing at the highest professional level in their respective sports: the Pittsburgh Pirates of the MLB , the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL , and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL .

[ 10 ] On April 15, 1876, Recreation Park was the site of a game between the Xanthas and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (alternately spelled "Alleghenys" [ 11 ] ), an unrelated forerunner to the "Alleghenys" team which would later be renamed the Pirates.  The Alleghenies won the game 7–3. [ 12 ] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association ; only a Canadian team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season. 1882 marked the first "major league" and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute. [ 13 ] The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss , who would go down in history as the "Father of the modern World Series" and its precursor, the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup , both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series. He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel (first "modern") baseball stadium, Forbes Field . Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901–1903, 1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925.  The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport. [ 14 ] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960, 1971, and 1979.  In 1960, the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run, hit by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game.  In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title.  Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit.  The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season. [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992.  Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ).  In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915.  The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] —including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some [ who? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period.  Just as they initially played in the first "modern" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete "modern" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915.  The " Black Fives " league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920–23. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937–39 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944–45 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947–48 before folding.  The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972.  In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s.  The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season.  Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title. [1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009–10 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season "neutral site" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain 's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. [ 19 ] Hockey [ edit ] See also: Flyers–Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia  § Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905–1907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 20 ] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. [ 21 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. [ 22 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jaromír Jágr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 23 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma , throughout his career. [ 26 ] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era. [ 27 ] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009. [ 28 ] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football [ edit ] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. [ citation needed ] The first professional football game was held at Recreation Park in Pittsburgh. [ citation needed ] Heffelfinger scored the game's only points as the Allegheny Athletic Association defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club , 4–0. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The early professional football era was also represented in Pittsburgh, by top athletic association teams in the Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit . The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club , was the top pro team in the state in 1898 and 1899. The first ever pro football all-star game was played at Exposition Park between the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and a collection of players from several teams in the area on December 3, 1898.  Duquesne won the game 16–0.  Later the Homestead Library & Athletic Club , fielded the top pro team in the state in 1900 and 1901. In 1902 the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League . The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple , the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. The team featured baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson , a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius , and outfielder with Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902. In 1933, as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney , who had been raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers . [ 31 ] Originally nicknamed the Pirates, [ 32 ] the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city's heritage of producing steel . The Steelers' first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947. [ 33 ] In 1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team. [ 34 ] Three years later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception . In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher , who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008. [ 33 ] As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame . [ 35 ] In October 1964, Ernie Stautner , who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers' player to have his number—70—retired. [ 36 ] Charles "Mean Joe" Greene had his number—75—retired in 2014.  In 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their "unbelievable" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney , son of founder Art Rooney, became the majority owner of the Steelers in November 2008 along with his son Art II, after they bought all of the shares of two of his four brothers. [ 39 ] Outside of the NFL, the city was represented by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937. It was also briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League , in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (which later became the Tampa Bay Storm ), of the Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990. A second Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power , played in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014. [ 40 ] In addition, Pittsburgh has also been home to women's full-contact football teams. The Pittsburgh Passion were founded in 2002 as members of the National Women's Football Association , then played in the Independent Women's Football League , and then Women's Football Alliance . [ 41 ] The Passion play their home games at West Allegheny High School in nearby Imperial . The team went 12–0 and won a national title in 2007 as members of the NWFA. [ 42 ] The Pittsburgh Rebellion were members of the Legends Football League during the 2017 season with home games at the downtown Highmark Stadium . The "most established area minor-league football team" the Pittsburgh Colts are members of the North American Football League 's Regional American Football League. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The United States Football League (2022) announced that the league would be relaunching in April 2022 and that the Pittsburgh Maulers would be returning [ 45 ] Soccer [ edit ] Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC are members of the USL Championship (second division) and play at Highmark Stadium . [ 46 ] The Riverhounds are one of the oldest professional soccer clubs in the United States operating outside of MLS; the only two older clubs are fellow USL Championship side Charleston Battery and USL League One's Richmond Kickers , both of which were founded in 1993. Like their counterparts, the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates, the Riverhounds are a full-time professional club, and many of their current and former players have represented their countries in international play. In 2024, the USL W League announced that the Riverhounds' ownership group had established a women's team to begin competing in 2025. [ 47 ] Several months later, the club's name, Pittsburgh Riveters SC , and crest were unveiled. [ 48 ] Historic teams such as the suburban Harmarville Hurricanes won the U.S. Open Cup , U.S. Soccer's national championship, with Harmarville winning in 1952 and 1956 and reaching the final in 1953. Pittsburgh area teams Gallatin and Morgan Strasser also won the Open Cup in its earlier years, but since the end of the 1950s, only the Riverhounds have advanced as far as the quarterfinals, which they achieved in 2001 and 2023. The amateur club Pittsburgh Beadling has contested for regional and national titles for over 100 years, winning the National Amateur Cup in 1954, [ 49 ] though Beadling now operates primarily as a youth club. Aldo Donelli , better known as a Duquesne University Football player and coach played soccer with a number of clubs in the 1920s and 1930s and was a member of the United States men's national soccer team during the 1934 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In a 4–2 qualifying victory over Mexico in Rome, Italy on May 24, he tallied all four times, becoming the first American to score his first three international goals with the senior team in the same match. The region's interest in soccer continues as modern stars such as natives Justin Evans , Meghan Klingenberg , Don Malinowski , John Stollmeyer , A. J. Wood and Marvell Wynne II have all achieved international success. Rugby [ edit ] The Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club are rugby union team based in South Side Pittsburgh . The club formed in 2018 when the Pittsburgh City RC and the Pittsburgh Highlanders combined to form the Forge. The Pittsburgh Forge currently fields two competitive men's senior sides and one competitive women's side. The men currently participate in the Midwest Competition Region (NCR1) at the Division II and Division III levels, and the women also play in the Midwest Competition Region at the Division II level. The Pittsburgh Sledgehammers are a rugby league team based in Cheswick, Pennsylvania (outside of Pittsburgh) which was formed in 2010 and plays in the AMNRL competition. The Pittsburgh Harlequins are a rugby union team also based in Cheswick. The Pittsburgh Harlequins Rugby Club was founded in 1973 by a group of University of Pittsburgh law students . The organization has an active roster of 45 players and an alumni roster inclusive of more than 70 seasons of play. The Harlequins Rugby Club is a Division I member of the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union . Over 300 active players wear the Harlequin jerseys every year at the Division 1 men's, Under 19, and Under 14 levels. In 1995, the Founders Field Center for Athletic Leadership was developed to support the Harlequins Men's and Youth programs. The 12-acre Founders Field facility includes lighting, irrigation, a clubhouse, locker rooms, concessions, and parking. The Pittsburgh Steeltoes , a Rugby sevens club with both a men's and women's team, was announced as an expansion team for the Premier Rugby Sevens in 2023. [ 50 ] Highmark Stadium hosted the 2023 Eastern Conference Final, marking the first ever professional rugby event held in the city. [ 51 ] Three of the Steeltoes' women represented their countries at the 2024 Summer Olympics : Kayla Canett and Sammy Sullivan for United States and Asia Hogan-Rochester for Canada , [ 52 ] winning bronze and silver, respectively. [ 53 ] Ultimate [ edit ] The Pittsburgh Thunderbirds are a professional ultimate team that competes in the Ultimate Frisbee Association (formerly known as the American Ultimate Disc League) since 2015. They play their home games at Highmark Stadium .

The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division . Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants , nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente , the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame , and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell . Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012 , a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues. [ 5 ] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League, [ 6 ] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839–10,819–140 (.500 winning 'percentage'). [ 7 ] The Pirates are also often referred to as the "Bucs" or the "Buccos" (derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park , a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins . History [ edit ] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club , an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City , across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. [ 8 ] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, [ 9 ] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association . Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, [ 10 ] the team was listed as "Allegheny" in the standings, and was sometimes called the "Alleghenys" (rarely the "Alleghenies") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. [ 11 ] Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League 's Pittsburgh Burghers . The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer , who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics . Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was "piratical". [ 12 ] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly "piratical" act gained them the occasional nickname "Pirates" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. [ 13 ] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. The 1909 Pirates in a poster celebrating their National League pennant. Frank Chance of Chicago and John McGraw of  New York, two teams the Pirates beat for the pennant, are being made to walk the plank . After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels , who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.) [ 14 ] Among those players was Honus Wagner , who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame . The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played , which they lost to Boston . The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909 , defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field . As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler , along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925 , becoming the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the World Series. [ 15 ] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees . The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season . Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960 . They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees , yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente , the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971 . Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass . In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. [ 16 ] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970 , 1971 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 , and 1979 . Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell , Dave Parker , and Al Oliver , the team was nicknamed "The Lumber Company." Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song "We Are Family" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3–1 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990. The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , and Doug Drabek . The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992 . Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. Andrew McCutchen , 2012 With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park , did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen , defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game . They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals . That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. [ 17 ] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th [ 18 ] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies , Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs . [ 19 ] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Ballpark [ edit ] Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium , a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. [ 20 ] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services . [ 21 ] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game , when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4–0. PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel façade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; [ 26 ] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, [ 27 ] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente , who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell , Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge , or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station , located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. Former ballparks [ edit ] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park , located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park , which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. [ 28 ] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. [ 29 ] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. Forbes Field , the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970 In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland , which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation. [ 30 ] Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss "hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field. [ 31 ] When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth 's career on May 25, 1935 [ 35 ] and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series . The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh "Pitt" Panthers . Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE , although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium . In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit. [ 38 ] LECOM Park , which hosts the Pirates' Spring Training games Spring Training [ edit ] Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida , which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders . Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach , which dates to 1914. [ 39 ] It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park , built in 1912, and Wrigley Field , built in 1914. [ 40 ] Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights. [ 41 ] The park was formerly named "McKechnie Field," for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie , who led the Pirates in 1925 ; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine , which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania , and also a campus in Bradenton. [ 42 ] Pirate City , the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park. Logos and uniforms [ edit ] 1888: "Alleghenys" Logo 1900–1906 1907 1908–1909 1915–1919 1921, 1932 1922 1923–1931 1933–1935 1948–present Uniform design in the 1940s The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the "P" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century. [ 43 ] During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple "P" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had "Pirates" running vertically down the placket. [ 43 ] The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and "Pittsburgh" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942. [ 43 ] In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic "Red, White, & Blue" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League . The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924, [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] but the change did not last beyond that season. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Along with the San Francisco Giants , the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an "accent color" in 1997 and remained until 2009. In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds ), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit). [ 43 ] The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch. Willie Stargell wearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes . After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. [ 43 ] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys , following the Oakland Athletics . Starting in 1977 , the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series . The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold "P" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since. [ 43 ] After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009 , the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold "P" at both home and on the road. [ 43 ] From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019. [ 49 ] Since the 2015 season , the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games. [ 50 ] The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season , now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches. [ 51 ] Ahead of the 2020 season , the Pirates revived the script "Pittsburgh" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the "P" logo outlined in black and yellow. [ 52 ] In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold "P", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park. In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new "4+1" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold "P" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh "PGH". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted "Y", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh ( Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio ). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous "Steelmark" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh. [ 53 ] Rivalries [ edit ] Philadelphia Phillies [ edit ] Main article: Phillies–Pirates rivalry The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies. [ 57 ] The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s. [ 56 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span. [ 58 ] After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry. [ 60 ] Cincinnati Reds [ edit ] Main article: Pirates-Reds rivalry The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds , given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry , and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason, [ 61 ] most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game . In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches , occasionally resulting in brawls. [ 62 ] Divisional foes [ edit ] From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series , which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious [ 63 ] battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game . The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of the 1938 season . Interleague [ edit ] The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers . While the Pirates and Tigers only became "natural rivals" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League 's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins . The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36–29. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series . An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically.  The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new "balanced" schedule.  The Pirates lead the series 21–18.

Pirates Hall of Fame [ edit ] In 2022, the Pirates formally established a team Hall of Fame to honor the "most influential ballplayers in Pittsburgh baseball history", as picked by an internal committee that had the help of team historian Jim Trdinich. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] 19 individuals were part of the first class, which included every Pittsburgh Pirate inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame along with several other former players, broadcasters, and coaches. Like the Washington Nationals with the Ring of Honor , the Pirates inducted players that had played for the Negro league baseball team Homestead Grays , which had played in Forbes Field and Greenlee Field in Pittsburgh alongside their time in Washington; two of the first class also spent time with the Pittsburgh Crawfords , with a ceremony dedicated to "signing" the four to Pirates contracts. All inductees were honored with a plaque displayed in the concourse by the entrance with the statue of Roberto Clemente .

On May 8, 1886, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys turned the first 3–4–2 triple play in Major League history. [ 83 ] In the fourth inning of a game, the Cincinnati Red Stockings put runners in first and second with no outs. John Reilly grounded out to first base, where Fred Carroll recorded the first out. He threw to second base, where Sam Barkley made the tag for the second out. The runner from second decided to try for home plate and he was cut down on a throw from Barkley and a tag by Doggie Miller . [ citation needed ] The Alleghenys won the game, 9–6. [ 84 ] First ever Major League Baseball game broadcast on the radio, a game between the Pirates and the host Philadelphia Phillies aired August 5, 1921, on KDKA (AM) Pittsburgh. The Pirates won the game, 8–5. In 1925 , the Pirates became the first MLB team to recover from a 3-games-to-1 deficit in winning a best-of-seven World Series; they then became the first MLB team to repeat that feat in 1979 . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] During the 1953 season, the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass " miner's cap ". This was the mandate of general manager Branch Rickey , who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game. [ 87 ] In 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a helmet with the comfort of a baseball cap. [ 88 ] The cap would prove widely unpopular, with only Alex Torres of the New York Mets choosing to wear it. [ 89 ] First franchise to win a World Series on a home run ( 1960 World Series ) in the 7th game. The only other team to accomplish this feat is the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993 , though theirs came in Game 6. In 1970 the Pirates became the first major league club to create their uniforms using a cotton-nylon blend featuring pull-over shirts and beltless pants. [ 90 ] The first all-minority lineup in MLB history took the field on September 1, 1971. [ 91 ] The lineup was Rennie Stennett , Gene Clines , Roberto Clemente , Willie Stargell , Manny Sanguillén , Dave Cash , Al Oliver , Jackie Hernández , and Dock Ellis . [ 92 ] The first World Series night game was played in Three Rivers Stadium on October 13, 1971— eleven years to the day since Mazeroski's walk-off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960 . In this case, however, it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, rather than a decisive Game 7. Apparently, good things happen for the Pirates on this date, as they knotted the 1971 World Series at two games apiece on their way to their fourth title. The first MLB scout to win the "Scout of the Year Award", Howie Haak , in 1984, three additional scouts from the organization have subsequently won the award. The first combined extra inning no-hitter in MLB history took place at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1997. Francisco Córdova (9 innings) and Ricardo Rincón (1 inning) combined to no-hit the Houston Astros , 3–0 in 10 innings. Pinch-hitter Mark Smith's three-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning sealed the victory and the no-hitter for the Pirates. It remains the only such no-hitter to date. [ 93 ] In November 2008, the Pirates became the first MLB team to sign Indian players when they acquired the non-draft free agents of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] This was also seen by Pirates general manager Neal Huntington , as "not only add[ing] two prospects to our system but also hope to open a pathway to an untapped market." [ 96 ] The Pirates are the first team in professional sports to have 20 consecutive losing seasons. This streak lasted from 1993 to 2012. This is the longest such streak in North American professional sports history. The Pirates are the first MLB team (as well as only second in major professional sports) to be owned by an openly gay owner, although Kevin McClatchy had already divested his shares in the Pirates when he openly announced his homosexuality in September 2012. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] On April 6, 2015, the Pirates' loss to the Cincinnati Reds earned the team its 10,000 franchise loss and making the Pirates the first MLB team to reach their 10,000th loss on an Opening Day. [ 18 ] On May 9, 2015, the Pirates became the first MLB team to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The triple play occurred during a 7–5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals . The play occurred when the Cardinals' Yadier Molina lined out to Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker . Walker then threw to third baseman Jung Ho Kang to double off the Cardinals' Jhonny Peralta for the second out. Kang then threw the ball back to Walker, who was standing on second base for the final out after St. Louis's Jason Heyward froze between second and third. [ 99 ] On April 24, 2017, the Pirates fielded the first baseball player to be born and raised in Lithuania , to reach the major leagues, Dovydas Neverauskas . In 1933, Joe Zapustas was the first Lithuanian-born player to play in MLB, as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics, however, he grew up in Boston. [ 100 ] On April 26, 2017, the Pirates promoted South African Gift Ngoepe from the AAA Indianapolis Indians ; making him the first African-born player in MLB history. [ 101 ] On August 23, 2017, the Pirates became the first team in MLB history to break up a no-hitter in extra innings with a walk-off home run . The home run was hit by Josh Harrison in the tenth inning, off of pitcher Rich Hill , to give the Pirates a 1–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers . [ 102 ] Minor league affiliations [ edit ] Main article: List of Pittsburgh Pirates minor league affiliates The Pittsburgh Pirates farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates. [ 103 ] Class Team League Location Ballpark Affiliated Triple-A Indianapolis Indians International League Indianapolis, Indiana Victory Field 2005 Double-A Altoona Curve Eastern League Altoona, Pennsylvania Peoples Natural Gas Field 1999 High-A Greensboro Grasshoppers South Atlantic League Greensboro, North Carolina First National Bank Field 2019 Single-A Bradenton Marauders Florida State League Bradenton, Florida LECOM Park 2010 Rookie FCL Pirates Florida Complex League Bradenton, Florida Pirate City Complex 1969 DSL Pirates Black Dominican Summer League Boca Chica , Santo Domingo Pirates Academy 2018 DSL Pirates Gold Civil rights advocacy [ edit ] Throughout the 1940s Pirates owner William Benswanger was a leading advocate of integration of the Major Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club. [ 104 ] The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963, the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh. [ 105 ] On September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minority players for the first time in MLB history. [ 106 ] Fanbase [ edit ] Bing Crosby co-owned the Pirates from 1946 until his death in 1977. Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby , Michael Keaton , and Regis Philbin , [ 107 ] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams . [ 108 ] However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013 , the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century. While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times ( XIV, XL, and XLIII ) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017 , including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s, [ 109 ] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped. [ 110 ] The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001. [ 111 ] Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting , with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season. [ 112 ] When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit . When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium . Community activities [ edit ] Each year, the Pirates recognize six "Community Champions" during a special pregame ceremony. [ 113 ] Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, "Ask Pirates Management", and appearances by the Pirate Parrot . Piratefest was once held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh [ 114 ] but is now held annually at the ballpark. Media [ edit ] Further information: Pittsburgh Pirates Radio Network and List of Pittsburgh Pirates broadcasters Radio and TV [ edit ] Map of Pirate radio affiliates The Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio on August 5, 1921. Harold Arlin , a foreman at Westinghouse , announced the game over KDKA from a box seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field . [ 115 ] [ 116 ] KDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with Rosey Rowswell becoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936. [ 117 ] Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games. In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM talk radio station WPGB . The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters. [ 118 ] On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM , [ 119 ] which became official on October 12. [ 120 ] On March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM. [ 121 ] As part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with Pittsburgh Panthers football and men's basketball. [ 122 ] Games are televised on SportsNet Pittsburgh , the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. The network is majority owned by Fenway Sports Group , owners of the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Penguins . The Pirates became joint owners of the channel on December 16, 2023, with operations to be produced by the Red Sox's home network NESN . [ 123 ] During the 2016 season, the Pirates averaged a 7.22 rating and 83,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts. [ 124 ] Apart from any Pirates games aired nationally on Fox, there has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002. Previously, KDKA-TV aired Pirates games for 38 years (1957–1994). Games also aired on WPXI (1995–1996) and on WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997–2002). Announcers [ edit ] Current The Pirates have no set broadcast team for radio or TV; instead, all announcers and analysts take turns working in both mediums over the course of a season. The longest-tenured broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk , both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst, [ 125 ] while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers . [ 126 ] Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps , Kevin Young , and Neil Walker . Past Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter , usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955. [ 127 ] Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] Nicknamed "The Gunner," Prince was known for his "Gunnerisms"—nicknames and quips—and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC . Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince. [ 130 ] Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett , who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015. [ 131 ] Former analysts include Don Hoak , Nelson Briles , and Jim Rooker . Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass , who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. [ 6 ] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys , and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. [ 6 ] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. [ 10 ] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney , owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II . The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation . [ 11 ] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers . Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium , which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field . History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933–present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the New York Giants . [ 6 ] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( 1936 ). [ 12 ] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White , a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the "Phil-Pitt Eagles" and were known as the " Steagles ". This team went 5–4–1. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the "Carpets"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21–0. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a " Playoff Bowl " in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL–NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3 million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969–1991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season . [ 21 ] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers "Mean" Joe Greene in 1969 , Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970 , Jack Ham in 1971 , Franco Harris in 1972 , [ 22 ] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann , Jack Lambert , John Stallworth , Donnie Shell and Mike Webster . [ 23 ] The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted five future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year. [ 24 ] The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two. [ 25 ] They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins ( 1971 – 1979 ) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year. The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9–7 record. [ 26 ] The 1981 season was no better, with an 8–8 showing. [ 27 ] The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. "Mean" Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season , Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982 's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983 's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984 's AFC Championship Game appearance. [ 28 ] After those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in 1985 , 1986 , and 1988 . In 1987 , the year of the players' strike , the Steelers finished with a record of 8–7, but missed the playoffs. [ 29 ] In 1989 , they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons. [ 30 ] Noll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209–156–1. [ 31 ] Bill Cowher years (1992–2006) In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher , a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton . [ 32 ] Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009 Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns . In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the "Blitzburgh" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later. [ 35 ] With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games. [ 36 ] Mike Tomlin years (2007–present) Roethlisberger in a Steelers' throwback jersey during the team's 500th win in franchise history On January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term "retire", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team. [ 37 ] A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy. [ 38 ] On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach. [ 39 ] Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history. [ 40 ] In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10–6 record and AFC North title. [ 41 ] The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season. [ 42 ] The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12–4 mark and a division title. [ 43 ] With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship, [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27–23 against the Arizona Cardinals . [ 46 ] At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl ( Tony Dungy was the first). [ 47 ] In their title defense, the Steelers went 9–7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season. [ 48 ] In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12–4 record and an AFC North title. [ 49 ] The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers , 31–25. [ 52 ] In the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12–4 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round. [ 53 ] The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins . [ 54 ] Overall, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in 2012. [ 55 ] In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason. [ 56 ] In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record. [ 57 ] They lost 30–17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round. [ 58 ] The Steelers finished with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season. [ 59 ] They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record. [ 62 ] They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13–3 mark. [ 66 ] Their postseason was short lived with a 45–42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. [ 67 ] Despite a 9–6–1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs. [ 68 ] The Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season. [ 69 ] The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11–0 start. [ 70 ] However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12–4. [ 71 ] The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48–37. [ 72 ] The 2021 season saw the team go 9–7–1 and make the postseason. [ 73 ] The Steelers lost 42–21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. [ 74 ] Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season. [ 75 ] Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162–94–2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013–17 seasons were noted for record performances from the " Killer B's ". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown , Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell . [ 76 ] Occasionally, the "Killer B's" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals. [ 77 ] Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. [ 78 ] Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9–8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season. [ 79 ] In the 2023 season, the team finished 10–7 and third in the AFC North. [ 80 ] They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31–17. [ 81 ] Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. [ 82 ] The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Summary Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444–282–2 (.635) and an overall record of 480–305–2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. [ 85 ] Ownership Art Rooney II , controlling owner of the Steelers Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations. [ 86 ] Dan Rooney , and his son, Art Rooney II , president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers – Timothy and Patrick – wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York. [ 87 ] Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines , causing them to violate "NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests". [ 88 ] Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time: Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr. , John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys. The Robert A. Paul family of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, which is primarily involved with Pittsburgh-based Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation as well as Morton's Restaurant Group, Urban Active Fitness, Meyer Products and Harley Marine Services. Additionally, family members serve on numerous boards , including Cornell University, UPMC , University of Pittsburgh , the American Red Cross , Harvard Medical School and the Loomis Chaffee School.

[ 91 ] Russ and Scott Swank of Lower Burrell . [ 92 ] Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams: [ 93 ] Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam purchased the Cleveland Browns in 2012. Hedge fund manager David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018. Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils owner Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders in 2023. Investment partner David Blitzer was also a part of the Harris group. Season-by-season records Further information: List of Pittsburgh Steelers seasons Through the end of the 2023 season , the Steelers have an all-time record of 707–606–22, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times. [ 94 ] In the NFL's "modern era" (since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). [ 95 ] The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The Steelers are 36–26 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger. [ 98 ] Civil rights advocacy The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry ), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam ), [ a ] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris ), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy ), the first owner to push for passage of an "equal opportunity" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer ( Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).

The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.

This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger . The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the " Steagles "; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used "Vegas Gold", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers "gold" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag . The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the " Steelmark ", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland -based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word "Steelers" surrounded by three astroids ( hypocycloids of four cusps ). The original meanings behind the astroids were, "Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world." Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel. [ 100 ] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word "Steel", the team was given permission to add "ers" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. [ 101 ] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants , are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968 . The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997 , the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ( Futura Condensed ) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007 . They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963 – 1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season . The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the "bumblebee jerseys" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season. [ 102 ] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed. [ 103 ] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then- Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. [ 104 ] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw . Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors. Rivals The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: ( Cleveland Browns , Baltimore Ravens , and Cincinnati Bengals ). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders , Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , New England Patriots , and Tennessee Titans . They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles , but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Divisional rivals Cleveland Browns Main article: Browns–Steelers rivalry The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1; [ 108 ] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Baltimore Ravens Main article: Ravens–Steelers rivalry Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable matchups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998 , 20–13, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field , 13–10. Later that season ( 2001 ) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27–10 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion . During their NFL championship season in 2000 , the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh , 16–0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9–6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32–24. [ 111 ] The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3–1 record. [ 112 ] Cincinnati Bengals Main article: Bengals–Steelers rivalry The Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFL–NFL merger was completed. In 1976 , the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game , in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title , won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play. [ 113 ] The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38–31, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11–5 and 8–8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006 . The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict , often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory. [ 60 ] The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35. [ 114 ] The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times. [ 115 ] Conference New England Patriots Main article: Patriots–Steelers rivalry The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field , though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997 ; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin . Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets . Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season . Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season. The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period ( 1998 – 2007 ) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at Foxborough in 2008 , after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16) and then won 36–17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game . They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back. [ 116 ] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh. In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2–1), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2–0), and the Denver Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots. [ 117 ] In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on Sunday Night Football . Tennessee Titans Main article: Steelers–Titans rivalry Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34–31 playoff showdown in 2002 ); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997–2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27–24 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020. [ 118 ] Denver Broncos Main article: Broncos–Steelers rivalry The Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970 , but the first notable contest came in 1973 , when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium , 23–13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35–35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34–21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33–10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium ; the Steelers pulled the upset 24–17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24–23. In 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game , where Denver squeaked out at 24–21 win. [ 119 ] Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34–17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV , the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow -led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the "316 game". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in Peyton Manning 's debut as Broncos quarterback . The two clubs met twice in 2015 , as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs. [ 120 ] Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27–19. Oakland Raiders Main article: Raiders–Steelers rivalry The Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13–7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris , who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception , while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time. [ 121 ] The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33–14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24–13) and 1975 (16–10) to reach the Super Bowl . The Raiders responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24–7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Raider George Atkinson as part of the NFL's "criminal element" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38–10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury. While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to the Raiders decline after 2002 ), the teams have had notable games against each other, including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20–13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski 's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27–24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010 , where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35–3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger . The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31–21 gap to win 34–31. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21–18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38–35 at Heinz Field. On December 9, 2018, in Oakland, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24–21, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth. [ 122 ] The Raiders won at Pittsburgh on September 19, 2021, 26–17, then fell on Christmas Eve 2022 at Pittsburgh 13–10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett . A lifeless performance in a 23–18 loss at Vegas on September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler . As of the 2024 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17–16. [ 123 ] Inter Conference Dallas Cowboys Main article: Cowboys–Steelers rivalry The Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys [ 124 ] started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in 1960 (against the Steelers) at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a 35–28 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl . The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21–17 and Super Bowl XIII 35–31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 – 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner , defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach , both of whom are in the Hall of Fame . In 1977 , Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII , their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28–13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979 , Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14–3 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title . The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996 , as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27–17. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century ( 2004 and 2008 ) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13–13, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27–24 margin in overtime and won 35–30 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–16. [ 125 ] The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film Black Sunday , parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24–19 margin. Philadelphia Eagles Main article: Eagles–Steelers rivalry The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts ) moved to the American Football Conference , while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference . As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3. [ 126 ] Culture Mascot Steely McBeam signing autographs for fans at Steelers training camp on August 2, 2007 Prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot. [ 127 ] As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team. [ 127 ] Diane Roles of Middlesex Township , submitted the winning name which was "meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, "Mc" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for Jim Beam , her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage." [ 128 ] Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events. [ 127 ] Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized S , and the L is drawn to look like a beam of steel. [ 127 ] Fanbase Main article: Steeler Nation The Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their "unbelievable" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. [ 11 ] [ 129 ] The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora ) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities. [ 130 ] The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season. [ 131 ] The Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but "Steeler bars" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams. Sailors and Marines aboard the USS Essex react as the Pittsburgh Steelers score against the Arizona Cardinals. The Terrible Towel has been described by the Associated Press as "arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team". [ 131 ] Conceived of by broadcaster Myron Cope in 1975 , [ 131 ] the towel's rights have since been given to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis , which cares for over 900 people with intellectual disability and physical disabilities , including Cope's autistic son. [ 132 ] Since 1996, proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2.5 million for the school. [ 132 ] Fight songs The Steelers have no official fight song, but many fan versions of "Here We Go Steelers" and the "Steelers Polka" (the latter a parody of " Pennsylvania Polka ") by ethnic singer Jimmy Pol, both originating in the 1970s, have been recorded. Since 1994, the song " Here We Go " by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans. [ 133 ] Since 2002, the 1979 Styx song " Renegade " is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper Wiz Khalifa , " Black and Yellow ", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience. [ 134 ] Cheerleaders Main article: Pittsburgh Steelerettes The Steelers were the first NFL team to have a cheerleading squad, they were known as the Steelerettes. Their run only lasted from 1961 to 1969. To this day, they were the only cheerleaders the team had in their history. [ 135 ] Basketball During the offseason, the Steelers have long participated in charity basketball games throughout Western Pennsylvania and neighboring areas. The games usually feature six active players as well as their player-coach playing against a group of local civic leaders. [ 136 ] The players, whose participants aren't announced until the day of the game, sign free autographs for fans during halftime. [ 137 ] Facilities Stadiums This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( June 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In 2001, the Steelers moved into Heinz Field . [ 138 ] The franchise dating back to 1933 has had several homes. [ 139 ] For 31 seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh . From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside . The team moved to what was then known as Heinz Field in 2001. In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium. [ 140 ] Training camp Steelers at training camp in Latrobe The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe . [ 141 ] The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: "... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania , an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland . Classic, wonderful slice of American culture . If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see." [ 142 ] The team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside . Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team. [ 143 ] In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season. [ 144 ] Historical facilities The Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s. [ 145 ] In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices. [ 146 ] During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director) [ 147 ] [ 148 ] and suburban Ligonier [ 149 ] also served as a pre-season training camp sites.

Further information: Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network As of 2006, the Steelers' flagship radio stations were WDVE 102.5 FM and WBGG 970 AM. Both stations are owned by iHeartMedia . Games are also available on 51 radio stations in Pennsylvania , Western Maryland , Ohio , and Northern West Virginia . [ 218 ] The announcer is Tunch Ilkin . Craig Wolfley is the sideline reporter. Myron Cope , the longtime color analyst and inventor of the " Terrible Towel ", retired after the 2004 season , and died in 2008. Longtime lead announcer Bill Hillgrove retired after the 2023 season . Pre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV , channel 2; independent sister station WPKD-TV , channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh . KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program Steelers Kickoff during the regular season prior to the national airing of The NFL Today . Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the Xfinity Xtra Point following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. Both Batch and Hoke replaced former Steelers lineman Edmund Nelson , who retired from broadcasting in 2015. [ 219 ] Thursday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on Fox affiliate WPGH-TV , channel 53 (along with home games with NFC opponents and some flexed interconference games), while ESPN Monday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on WTAE-TV , channel 4. (WTAE-TV is owned by the Hearst Corporation , which owns a 20% stake in ESPN.) By virtue of being members of the AFC, most of the Steelers' games air on CBS and KDKA. NBC Sunday Night Football games are carried by WPXI , channel 11, in the market. The Steelers hold a national contract with Grupo Imagen for radio rights to their games in Mexico; Imagen broadcasts the Steelers on their stations in 17 Mexican cities. Figures with broadcasting résumés Main article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers figures in broadcasting The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope , who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons ( 1970 – 2004 ). [ 220 ] Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. Newspaper The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. [ 221 ] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. Usage in popular culture The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films: The January 11, 1975, episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device. [ 222 ] Black Sunday in 1977 [ 223 ] Heaven Can Wait in 1978 [ 224 ] Smokey and the Bandit II in 1980 [ 225 ] Fighting Back in 1980 [ 226 ] Hey Kid, Catch! in 1980 [ 227 ] ...All the Marbles in 1981 Evening Shade (TV series) 1990–1994 [ 228 ] The Waterboy cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998 [ 229 ] The Longest Yard in 2005 The Chief a theater production. Black and Yellow in 2010. [ 230 ] The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Mad Men's April 14, 2013, episode has Don Draper , Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling meeting with two HJ Heinz executives. The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20–28). Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE . [ 233 ] The protagonist of John Grisham 's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan. [ 234 ] In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country , featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain . [ 235 ] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'. The Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research The Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1 million. [ 236 ] The Foundation, started by Steelers president Art Rooney II, focuses on education and research regarding brain injuries and sports-related concussions. [ 237 ] In June 2017, the Steelers announced an inaugural charity walk to raise money for the foundation.

The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference . The team has played its home games at PPG Paints Arena since 2010, and has previously played at the Civic Arena , which was better known by its nickname "the Igloo". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams – the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL . Founded during the 1967 expansion , the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals , winning the Stanley Cup five times – in 1991 , 1992 , 2009 , 2016 , and 2017 . Along with the Edmonton Oilers , the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non- Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame , including co-owner Mario Lemieux , who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr , Sidney Crosby , and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise. History Early years (1967–1984) Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League 's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor , a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania , began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III , Pittsburgh Steelers ' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family 's Richard Mellon Scaife . The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners ; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris , owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris , owner of the Detroit Red Wings . The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967–68 season . The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena 's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Civic Arena 's capacity was increased to meet NHL requirements for a franchise. The arena served as the Penguins' home arena from 1967 to 2010. A contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked "Penguins" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio . (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the "Igloo", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena), [ 7 ] [ 8 ] a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the " Golden Triangle " of downtown Pittsburgh. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley , opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario , [ 10 ] on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing "Original Six" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate , all-star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and New York Rangers ' veteran Earl Ingarfield , a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald , and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley . George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain. [ 11 ] On October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens . [ 5 ] On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley , who recorded a 2.88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game . Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti . [ 6 ] The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players – including longtime future Penguins star Jean Pronovost – making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains. Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969–1974) Michel Briere 's number was taken out of circulation after his career-ending accident in 1970. It was later formally retired in 2001. In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke . Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito . Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semifinals, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec , suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001. [ 6 ] In the 1970–71 season , the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972 , only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr. , Keith McCreary , agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972. The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974 , when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button . Button obtained Steve Durbano , Ab DeMarco , Bob "Battleship" Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28–41–9 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth. However, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into bankruptcy . The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate. [ 12 ] Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 1976–77 season . [ 13 ] Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair , the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. Playoff runs and a uniform change (1974–1982) During the mid-1970s, Lowell MacDonald was paired with Syl Apps Jr. and Jean Pronovost , forming the "Century Line ". MacDonald played with the Penguins from 1970 to 1978. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the "Century Line" of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the semifinals in 1975 , but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. Baz Bastien , a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977–78 . Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins . [ 6 ] The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh . Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980. [ 14 ] On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle , and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else. During the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 1982 playoffs , the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli , who had tied the game before. [ 15 ] It would be the Penguins' final playoff appearance until 1989 . Lemieux–Jagr era (1984–2005) Mario Lemieux played for the Penguins in two stints (1984–1997, 2000–2006). The team had the league's worst record in both the 1982–83 and 1983–84 seasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate. Mario Lemieux , one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the 1984 NHL entry draft . Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils , who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management. [ 16 ] Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted. [ 17 ] Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers (after the Oilers' 1987 Stanley Cup win) and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens , Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Penguins; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. In 1985–86 , the Penguins missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In 1986–87 , they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987–88 , for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game. [ 11 ] In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game. [ 11 ] Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989–1997) A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989–90 season , although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings ( Bryan Trottier ) and trades ( Joe Mullen , Larry Murphy , Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson ) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL entry draft . The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.
The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals , the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush , the first NHL team ever to visit the White House . [ 18 ] The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer , and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991–92 . [ 6 ] [ 11 ] Cancer diagnosis revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma . Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates . Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy . After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of the success, the 1993 playoffs ended in the division finals when the New York Islanders eliminated the Penguins in seven games. [ 11 ] [ 6 ] The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev , Martin Straka , Aleksey Morozov , Robert Lang and Petr Nedved , and defensemen Sergei Zubov , Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher . Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games. [ 11 ] Lemieux's retirement and return (1997–2001) Lemieux with the Penguins during the 2000–01 season , his first season after coming out of retirement. On April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin. The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4–1 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2 in the second round. By this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998. Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity – enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle ) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time. [ 6 ] Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs , highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the conference finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils. [ 6 ] Rebuilding (2001–2005) Marc-Andre Fleury was drafted first overall in 2003 by the Penguins. The Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998–99, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year. [ 19 ] Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002 , finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The following season they finished second-last. In the 2003 NHL entry draft , the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with the first overall pick. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The 2003–04 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout. [ 19 ] As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator) Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL entry draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL entry draft ( Alexander Ovechkin ), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center Evgeni Malkin , was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut. [ 22 ] By this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City, Missouri . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season . One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators , which had filed for bankruptcy protection. [ 27 ] During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins , and to European leagues. [ 6 ] Crosby–Malkin era (2005–present) Sidney Crosby during his sophomore season with the Penguins. He was drafted first overall by the team in the 2005 draft . With the lockout resolved in 2005, the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the 2005 NHL entry draft selection order. The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a "secure location", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) superstar Sidney Crosby (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer) [ 28 ] was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as "The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh. [ 11 ] The Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague . The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005–06 season. [ 19 ] However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien . Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an irregular heartbeat , this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to Wayne Gretzky 's 1.92. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Despite the team's struggles, Crosby established himself as a star in the league, amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the 2006 NHL entry draft , and selected touted two-way forward Jordan Staal . The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick , who had been the general manager since December 1989. [ 33 ] On May 25, Ray Shero signed a five-year contract as general manager. Runner–up and third Stanley Cup title (2006–2010) Evgeni Malkin made an immediate impact, driving the Penguins to their first playoff appearance in six years. Change came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games. [ 34 ] The Penguins finished the 2006–07 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47–24–11, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4–1. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won. On March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's governor Ed Rendell , Allegheny County chief executive Dan Onorato , Pittsburgh's mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center , guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040. [ 35 ] After a mediocre start to the 2007–08 season , Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title – their first division title in 10 years – with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy . The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy . Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe Trophy -winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead. Crosby, Bill Guerin , and Chris Kunitz during the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals . The Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals, earning their third Stanley Cup title. In the 2008–09 season , Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in Detroit , like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2–1 to win their third Stanley Cup title. [ 36 ] Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. [ 11 ] During the 2009–10 season , Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive game 7, which the Penguins lost 5–2, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena. [ 37 ] New arena and injuries (2010–2015) Outside of Consol Energy Center (now PPG Paints Arena) in March 2010 before it officially opened. The Penguins hosted the Washington Capitals at Heinz Field during the 2011 Winter Classic . In 2010–11 , the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center . On February 11, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins–New York Islanders brawl took place. [ 38 ] A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3–1 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning , with Fleury's goaltending called into question. [ 39 ] With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome , at the start of the 2011–12 season , Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. [ 40 ] Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award . Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL entry draft for the upcoming 2012–13 season . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] During the lockout -shortened 2012–13 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the conference finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million. [ 43 ] On July 1, 2015, the Penguins acquired right-winger Phil Kessel in a multi-player deal. In the 2013–14 season , the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division , though the club struggled in the playoffs , requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets , then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3–1 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford , the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. [ 44 ] Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014–15 season , the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps , the team fell to fourth in the division. The Penguins lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel . [ 45 ] Back-to-back Stanley Cups and 50th anniversary (2015–2017) After acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015–16 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15–10–3 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan , who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. [ 46 ] This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Crosby with the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade. The team won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in 2016 . The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs , the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4–1 series, the Capitals 4–2 and the Lightning 4–3 to win the Eastern Conference championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks . [ 49 ] On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4–2 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. [ 50 ] The Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. [ 51 ] The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs , defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the conference finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals , where they faced the Nashville Predators . The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era. [ 6 ] Patric Hornqvist celebrates the 2017 Stanley Cup -clinching goal against the Nashville Predators . Playoff streak (2017–2023) Before the 2017–18 season , the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL expansion draft to the Vegas Golden Knights . [ 52 ] Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. [ 53 ] In the next season , the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round. [ 54 ] In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic , the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs , but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round. [ 55 ] On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1,000 NHL games for the team. [ 58 ] The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. [ 59 ] This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs . [ 60 ] The 2020–21 season came to an end in game 6 of the first round of the 2021 playoffs against the New York Islanders. [ 61 ] On November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. [ 62 ] On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins. [ 63 ] In the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs , the Penguins lost in seven games to the New York Rangers despite having a 3–1 series lead. The game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6–0 the previous six instances. [ 64 ] The 2022–23 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform. [ 65 ] This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. [ 66 ] However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005–06, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in dismissals of Burke and Hextall. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Dubas era (2023–present) On June 1, 2023, Kyle Dubas was named the team's new president of hockey operations. [ 69 ] On August 6, the Penguins traded for Norris Trophy -winning defenseman Erik Karlsson in a three-team deal also involving the Montreal Canadiens . [ 70 ] On February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favorite forward Jake Guentzel , trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes . [ 71 ] Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season When the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers , clinching the final spot as the second wild card. [ 72 ] Team information Crest and sweater design When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word "Pittsburgh" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. [ 73 ] The team's colors were originally powder blue , navy blue , and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, [ 74 ] beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city. [ 73 ] The Penguins generally wore the black and gold "skating penguin" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983–84 season. [ 73 ] In the 1992–93 season , the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the "flying penguin" logo, or "Robopenguin". [ 75 ] [ 76 ] The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal "Pittsburgh" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey , featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the "skating penguin" logo, but with a "Vegas gold" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the "skating penguin" was readopted as the primary, though the "flying penguin" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the "Vegas gold" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995–2002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the "flying penguin" logo from the shoulders. [ 73 ] Throughout the 2016–17 season, a commemorative patch was added to the uniforms to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. The Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003–04 NHL season . The team wore their powder blue, 1968–1972 " throwbacks " against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 Winter Classic . This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the 2011 Winter Classic . [ 77 ] For the 2011–12 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired. [ 78 ] Called the "Blue Jerseys of Doom" by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms. [ 73 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] In 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured "Pittsburgh gold", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. [ 81 ] The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black "Pittsburgh gold" alternates, thus retiring the "Vegas gold" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016–17 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. [ 82 ] During the 2017 Stadium Series against the archrival Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a "City of Champions" patch and a variation of the "skating penguin" logo. [ 83 ] This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018–19 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms. [ 84 ] The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 Stadium Series . [ 85 ] In 2021, the Penguins wore white "Reverse Retro" uniforms based on the 1992–97 uniforms. This set replaced the "flying penguin" with the alternate "skating penguin" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders. [ 86 ] A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021–22 season. [ 87 ] In the 2022–23 season, the Penguins unveiled their second "Reverse Retro" uniform, this time featuring a black version of the white "flying penguin" uniform they wore from 1992 to 2002. [ 88 ] For the 2023 Winter Classic , the Penguins went with a vintage white uniform with black stripes, and added a gold "P" logo as a nod to the NHL Pirates of the late 1920s. [ 89 ] Arenas The Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to the state-of-the-art Consol Energy Center (now named the PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two "home" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio , in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh; [ 90 ] the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s). [ 91 ] The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania , in April 2015. The complex opened in August 2015, and is used by the Penguins as their practice facility. From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University 's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home, [ 92 ] and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228 . [ 93 ] The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play. [ 94 ] As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Minor league affiliates The Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania , since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the ECHL , the Wheeling Nailers , which they have been associated with since the start of the 2000–01 ECHL season . [ 97 ] Fanbase Iceburgh, the mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald , brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald , [ 98 ] noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins. [ 99 ] However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams , taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field. [ 100 ] Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround) [ 101 ] ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level. [ 102 ] In the community The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation conducts numerous community activities to support both youth and families through hockey education and charity assistance.

[ 110 ] Hockey Hall of Fame The Pittsburgh Penguins presently acknowledge an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Inductees affiliated with the Penguins include 15 former players and five builders of the sport. [ a ] [ 111 ] The four individuals recognized as builders by the Hockey Hall of Fame includes former head coaches, and general managers. In addition to builders and players, broadcasters and sports journalists have also been recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame, however are not inductees. In 2001, radio play-by-play broadcaster Mike Lange , was awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hall of Fame.

The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in Pennsylvania . The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153–98–30 record. [ 122 ] However, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the conference semifinals. [ 123 ] The franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 division finals, 4–3; 1997 conference quarterfinals, 4–1; 2000 conference semifinals, 4–2; and 2012 conference quarterfinals, 4–2) and the Penguins winning three (2008 conference finals, 4–1; 2009 conference quarterfinals, 4–2; and 2018 first round, 4–2). Washington Capitals Main article: Capitals–Penguins rivalry An altercation between the Penguins and the Washington Capitals during the 2009 playoffs. The two teams have faced off 11 times in the playoffs, with the Penguins winning nine of the 11 matchups, their two series losses coming in the 1994 and 2018 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to their five Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. The NHL's fourth Winter Classic , played on January 1, 2011, at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh showcased this rivalry. The Capitals won the game 3–1. The rivalry can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the Hershey Bears . [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Media Radio Further information: Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network The Penguins have their radio home on WXDX-FM and their television home on SportsNet Pittsburgh . The Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network consists of a total of 34 stations in four states. [ 127 ] Twenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in West Virginia, three in Ohio, and three in Maryland. The network also features an FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh. Broadcasters Main article: List of Pittsburgh Penguins broadcasters Local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV broadcast the Penguins during the 1967–68 season, with station Sports Director Ed Conway handling the play-by-play during both the television and radio broadcasts. He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968–69 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969–70 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970–71 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970–71 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a color commentator to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] Mike Lange served as a play-by-play commentator for the team from 1974 until 2021. Mike Lange , who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974–75 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979–80 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972–73. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984–85, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. 
With Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman Peter Taglianetti . Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach Rick Kehoe after the 2002–03 season. [ 130 ] With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired Bob Errey as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003–04 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005–06. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016–17 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016–17 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and NHL Network personality Steve Mears was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017–18 season. Lange retired in the 2021 off-season, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement. Phil Bourque serves as the radio color commentator. Before the 2023–24 season, Getzoff moved to the television booth with Mears replacing him on the radio. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] The Penguins did not retain TV analyst Bob Errey, choosing to go with a rotation of analysts featuring former Penguins Colby Armstrong , Mike Rupp and Phil Bourque. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] In 2024, Joe Brand replaced Steve Mears on the radio booth after Mears was hired by the Blue Jackets. [ 135 ] Every Penguins game is carried on the AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. On October 2, 2023, the network will be purchased by the Penguins and rebranded to SportsNet Pittsburgh . [ 136 ] In addition, Fox Sports Ohio simulcasts Penguins hockey in the Cleveland metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly "game of the week" national exposure on American networks ESPN , ESPN+ , ABC , and TNT , and Canadian networks Sportsnet and CBC . Previously, the Penguins received national TV exposure on Fox , NBC and NBCSN in the U.S., and TSN in Canada. In-game announcers Ryan Mill has been the Penguins' public address announcer since 2009 when he succeeded John Barbero. Jeff Jimerson has been the team's official anthem singer since 1991 and also served in the same capacity in the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Sudden Death . Notes ^ The Penguins also recognize an affiliation with Hall of Famer Red Kelly , who served as the Penguins' head coach from 1969 to 1973. However, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the players' category in 1969, not its builder category, and had never played for the Penguins. However, the team continues to acknowledge an affiliation as a Penguins Hall of Famer. [ 111 ] References ^ "Penguins Make The Move to 'Pittsburgh Gold' " . PittsburghPenguins.com .

American soccer team Soccer club Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC Full name Pittsburgh Riverhounds Soccer Club Nickname(s) The Hounds [ 1 ] Founded March 11, 1998 ; 26 years ago ( 1998-03-11 ) [ 2 ] Stadium Highmark Stadium Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [ 3 ] Capacity 5,000 [ 3 ] Owner Tuffy Shallenberger [ 4 ] Head coach Bob Lilley League USL Championship [ 5 ] 2024 7th, Eastern Conference Playoffs: Conference Quarterfinals Website riverhounds.com Home colors Away colors Third colors Current season Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC is an American professional soccer team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . Founded in 1998 and beginning play in 1999, the club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship , the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. Since 2013, the Riverhounds have played their home games at the 5,000-seat Highmark Stadium , a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square . Their current head coach is Bob Lilley . [ 6 ] Saint Lucian international David Flavius currently holds the club records for most appearances and goals which he set over his eight seasons with the Riverhounds between 1999 and 2006. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC An ownership group led by local banker Paul Heasley was awarded a Pittsburgh expansion franchise in the USL A-League by USISL on March 11, 1998. The team was planned to begin playing in the 1999 season and would be the first professional outdoor soccer team in the city since the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the National Professional Soccer League folded after the 1967 season. [ 8 ] The name "Riverdogs" was initially selected until the threat of legal action by the Charleston RiverDogs led the team to change their name to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in December 1998. [ 9 ] The Riverhounds played their first match on May 1, 1999, against the Cincinnati Riverhawks at Bethel Park Stadium in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania . The team lost 3–2 in a penalty shootout after a scoreless draw in front of a sellout crowd of 5,639 spectators. [ 10 ] They drew an average attendance of 4,178 in their inaugural season—the second-best in the league—and qualified for the A-League playoffs, where Pittsburgh were eliminated by the Rochester Rhinos in the second round. [ 11 ] The team's attendance declined in later seasons as Heasley unsuccessfully pursued plans for a soccer-specific stadium to replace Bethel Park by 2005. [ 12 ] The Riverhounds moved a tier below the A-League (later the USL First Division) to the USL Pro Soccer League (later the Second Division) in 2004 amid financial issues. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The team underwent several ownership changes and continued to have unstable finances; it withdrew from competition for the 2007 season but continued to run its youth programs and the senior team returned the following year. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In April 2013, the team opened Highmark Stadium in Pittsburgh with an initial capacity of 3,102 seats and plans for future expansions. The stadium cost $10.2 million to construct, entirely with private contributions, and was the result of several design and location changes. [ 15 ] The Riverhounds successfully drew larger crowds at their new stadium and averaged 3,273 spectators during the 2013 season. The remaining financial issues and debts incurred from stadium construction caused the team to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2014 but remain playing. [ 14 ] [ 16 ] Majority ownership was sold to Tuffy Shallenberger, a construction company owner who was part of the ownership group, and the team focused on expanding its youth academy business. The Riverhounds unveiled a new crest and identity in 2018, replacing a cartoon dog with a modern roundel, and expanded Highmark Stadium to 5,000 seats. [ 14 ] The Riverhounds remained part of the USL's third-division league, which was restructured into USL Pro and later the USL Championship after it received second-division sanctioning. [ 14 ] In 2013, the team announced a plan to join Major League Soccer , the country's top-flight league, within the next decade as an expansion franchise. The plan would require further expansion of Highmark Stadium to meet the league's minimum of 18,000 seats. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The Riverhounds have never submitted a formal bid for an MLS franchise during previous rounds of expansion. [ 19 ] Colors and badge [ edit ] Originally, the Riverhounds' colors were predominantly red with smaller amounts of black and white. Pittsburgh-based BD&E designed the original logo. The firm made a strategic decision not to make the club's colors black and gold. The choice meant the Hounds would not align with the region's established professional sports identity but would allow the soccer fans' jerseys to stand out in a Pittsburgh crowd. [ 20 ] The club adopted new colors, predominantly blue with white and black added, before the start of the 2008 season to honor their academy and training partnership with Everton . The use of blue was also an allusion to the blue collar populace of Pittsburgh. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Beginning in 2014, the Riverhounds began wearing black and gold uniforms more regularly, aligning the club with the colors representative of Pittsburgh's other professional sports teams . Blue and black kits continued to be worn as an alternate third version. [ 23 ] On February 16, 2018, the Riverhounds unveiled a new crest as part of its rebranding. [ 24 ] The new crest incorporates traditional Pittsburgh sports colors with important symbols of the city such as bridges and rivers. The crest was designed by Oregon-based graphic designer Brian Gundell.

The stadium is owned and operated by the Riverhounds organization. [ 31 ] Highmark Stadium as seen from Mount Washington Highmark Stadium main stand Highmark Stadium Supporters [ edit ] In November 2007, the first supporters group of the Pittsburgh Riverhounds was formed, The Steel Army. The Steel Army held their first meeting at Piper's Pub in Pittsburgh's South Side . The group started as 5–10 local people interested in supporting the reorganized Riverhounds Soccer Club and in supporting the efforts of growing the sport of soccer in Western Pennsylvania as well. [ 32 ] Members are from Pittsburgh and nearby states like Ohio and distant states such as Oregon and Florida . Membership in the Steel Army is also international. Members have joined from Portsmouth , Sunderland , Surrey and Derbyshire in the U.K. , Bray in the Republic of Ireland , and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil . [ 32 ] The section of Highmark Stadium where the Steel Army stands and supports the Riverhounds is located at the South Gate end of the stadium. The terrace there holds 1,000 supporters. On August 1, 2015, the supporters' section was renamed the Paul Child Stand in honor of Pittsburgh soccer legend Paul Child . [ 33 ] The Steel Army had fierce rivalries with United Soccer League clubs Rochester Rhinos (Oak Street Brigade) before the club moved to USL League One .

The Thunderbirds compete in the Ultimate Frisbee Association (UFA) as a member of the Central Division. They play their home games at Highmark Stadium , a soccer stadium in Pittsburgh's Station Square . History [ edit ] Founding [ edit ] Pittsburgh has long been a considered a hotbed for ultimate, with strong youth programs and adult club teams. Through the 2010's, the University of Pittsburgh's ultimate club team was a national powerhouse, winning back-to-back National Championships in 2012 and 2013, with multiple former players going on to compete in both the American Ultimate Disc League and Major League Ultimate . A Pittsburgh-based franchise for the AUDL was announced via a private Pittsburgh ultimate Facebook group in June 2014, under the ownership of Dr. Tracy Neuendorf. Andrew Gardner (stepson of Neuendorf) and Elliot Diamond were announced as the team's inaugural general manager and assistant general manager. [ 1 ] Gardner and others polled local players and fans at MARS (Pittsburgh's annual mixed Ultimate tournament) with slips of paper listing eighteen potential names. "Thunderbirds" was announced as the winning choice on July 9, 2014. [ 2 ] 2015 [ edit ] The Pittsburgh Thunderbirds finished 2nd in the Midwest division with a 12–2 record, behind the Madison Radicals who finished 13–1. The Madison Radicals lone loss was to the Thunderbirds on May 2, 2015 at Founder's Field in Pittsburgh. On June 12, 2015, the Thunderbirds were featured on ESPN3's game of the week against the Chicago Wildfire, dropping the contest 19–16 for their 2nd loss of the 2015 season. Due to scheduling conflicts, the Midwest playoffs had to be played on the same day, July 25, 2015. The #3 seed Chicago Wildfire met the #2 seeded Thunderbirds at a neutral site outside of Madison, Wisconsin at 4:00PM local time. In overtime, Max Thorne threw the go-ahead goal to Aaron Watson to secure the 24–23 victory. 3 hours later, the Thunderbirds went on to face the #1 seeded Madison Radicals at Breese Stevens Field in Madison, Wisconsin . The Thunderbirds would go on to lose the Midwest Championship, 24–21 after Tyler DeGirolamo exited the game with a recurring leg injury. 2015 Regular Season Results Date Opponent Score Record 4/11/15 @ Indianapolis Alleycats 28–20 W 1–0 4/25/15 Cincinnati Revolution 30–16 W 2–0 5/2/15 @ Madison Radicals 24–18 L 2–1 5/3/15 @ Minnesota WindChill 30–17 W 3–1 5/9/15 Minnesota WindChill 28–22 W 4–1 5/30/15 Detroit Mechanix 44–20 W 5–1 6/6/15 Madison Radicals 26–22 W 6–1 6/12/15 @ Chicago Wildfire 19–16 L 6–2 6/13/15 @ Detroit Mechanix 34–21 W 7–2 6/20/15 @ Cincinnati Revolution 25–19 W 8–2 6/28/15 Chicago Wildfire 27–26 W (OT) 9–2 7/10/15 Detroit Mechanix 42–16 W 10–2 7/11/15 @ Cincinnati Revolution 33–27 W 11–2 7/18/15 Indianapolis AlleyCats 29–25 W 12–2 2015 Midwest Playoffs Results 7/25/15 @Chicago Wildfire 24–23 W (OT) 13–2 7/25/15 @Madison Radicals 24–21 L 13–3 2016-2019 [ edit ] The Thunderbirds finished the 2016 season with a 10-4 record, second in the Midwest Division behind the Madison Radicals. In the divisional playoffs, they defeated the Minnesota Wind Chill 20-18 before falling the Radicals in the Division Finals by a score of 20-16. The Thunderbirds qualified for their third consecutive playoff appearance with a 7-4, once again defeating the Minnesota Wind Chill in the opening round and losing to the Madison Radicals in the Division Finals. On November 13, 2017, Thunderbirds' player Pat Hammonds was announced as the new head coach, succeeding David Hogan. [ 3 ] The 2018 season saw Pittsburgh post its first losing season in franchise history, finishing in 5th place in the Midwest Division with a 4-10 record. Pittsburgh saw a significant improvement in 2019, finishing with an 8-4 record and returning to the playoffs as the second-place team in the Midwest Division. On June 8, the AUDL hosted its first All-Star Game at Breese Stevens Field in Madison . Pittsburgh cutter Max Sheppard, the sole Thunderbirds player selected for the All-Star Game, was named the game's Most Valuable Player. [ 4 ] In the opening round of the 2019 playoffs, the Thunderbirds defeated the Chicago Wildfire 21-20 to advance to their fourth Midwest Finals appearance in five seasons, where they lost to the Indianapolis AlleyCats 23-17. 2020's [ edit ] Following the 2019 season, the AUDL announced a realignment of its divisions, with the Thunderbirds moving from the Midwest Division (now known as the Central Division) to the newly-formed Atlantic Division. [ 5 ] Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic , the 2020 season was initially postponed before being officially cancelled on June 24, 2020. [ 6 ] The 2021 season would be the Thunderbirds' worst to date, finishing last in the Atlantic Division with a 1-11 record. Only the Detroit Mechanix (0-12) would finish the season with a worse record. After the 2021 season, the AUDL went back to its prior four-division format, and the Thunderbirds returned to the Central Division. [ 7 ] Prior to the start of the 2022 season, the Thunderbirds announced a partnership with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC of the USL Championship . The deal included a home game against the Madison Radicals to be played at Highmark Stadium, a cross-promotion between the two teams, team-specific ticket discount offers, and halftime exhibition show by the Thunderbirds at the Riverhounds' May 14 home game against El Paso Locomotive FC . On June 22, 2024, the Thunderbirds were dealt a 26-15 defeat by the Detroit Mechanix , snapping Detroit's infamous seven-year-long, 81-game losing streak. [ 8 ] Rivalries [ edit ] Philadelphia Phoenix [ edit ] The Pittsburgh Thunderbirds and Philadelphia Phoenix first met during the 2018 season , with the Phoenix winning 30-18. Although the two teams have played in different divisions for much of their history, a rivalry between them was natural due to being the only teams from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , as well as long-standing rivalries between the cities baseball , football , and hockey teams. The two organizations created the Commonwealth Cup trophy to be awarded to the winner of each matchup. [ 9 ] Stadium [ edit ] Prior to the start of the 2023 season, it was announced that the Thunderbirds would begin playing their home games at Highmark Stadium as part of an expanded partnership between the team and Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, the stadium's primary tenant. [ 10 ] Previously, the Thunderbirds played their home games at Founders Field in Cheswick , and J.C. Stone Field in Pittsburgh's North park complex.
