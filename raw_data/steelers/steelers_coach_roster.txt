Alfredo Roberts
Tight Ends Coach
College: University of Miami
Experience: 20 years
Biography
Alfredo Roberts is in his third year as the team's tight ends coach. He was hired on Jan. 25, 2021.
Roberts, who starts his 25th year of coaching overall, saw another year of success from Pat Freiermuth, who despite injuries, finished the season sixth in receptions (63) and receiving yards (732) among all NFL tight ends. His 63 catches also ranked fourth-most by a tight end in a single season in franchise history.
In 2021, Roberts led a tight ends room headlined by Freiermuth, who finished his debut season setting a franchise record for receptions by a rookie tight end (60) and receiving yards by a rookie tight end (497). His seven touchdowns accounted for almost as many as his entire tight end draft class combined (8). In addition, third-year tight end Zach Gentry saw his production increase greatly with 167 receiving yards.
Roberts spent the previous four seasons with the L.A. Chargers as their running backs coach (2017-19) and tight ends coach (2020). He also has made stops in Indianapolis (2012-15), Tampa Bay (2009-11), Cleveland (2007-08) and Jacksonville (2003-06).
Over his 16 seasons coaching in the NFL, Roberts has mentored multiple Pro Bowl players at tight end and running back, as well as All-Rookie honors for tight end Dwayne Allen in 2012.
Roberts coached running back Melvin Gordon III in 2018 to his second Pro Bowl. Gordon III registered 1,375 scrimmage yards. He surpassed 1,300 yards from scrimmage for the third consecutive season. Fullback Derek Watt was also named a third alternate for the Pro Bowl.
As tight ends coach in Indianapolis for four seasons, he tutored both Allen and Coby Fleener, who became the first pair of tight ends in NFL history to each have eight or more TD receptions in a season (2014). Roberts also coached current Colts starting tight end, Jack Doyle.
In 2003, Roberts accepted his first NFL position as the tight ends coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, guiding Marcedes Lewis as a rookie.
Roberts began his coaching career in 1998 at Florida Atlantic University. He spent the first two years recruiting prior to the program's inaugural season in 2000. Roberts coached tight ends for two seasons (2000-01) before coaching the Owls' wide receivers in 2002.
Roberts was an eighth-round pick by Kansas City in the 1988 NFL Draft. He spent three seasons with the Chiefs before joining Dallas in 1991. Roberts was part of two Super Bowl championship teams in Dallas (1992 and '93). He played in every game for five consecutive seasons. Roberts finished his career with 50 catches for 476 yards and two TDs in 82 career games.
A native of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Roberts graduated from the University of Miami, where he was a member of two national championship teams as a tight end. Roberts played on five bowl teams for the Hurricanes, including two Orange Bowls, two Fiesta Bowls and one Sugar Bowl.

Anthony Midget
Assistant Secondary Coach
Experience: 9 years
Biography
Midget comes to the Steelers with nine years of NFL experience, after spending three seasons as the secondary coach with the Tennessee Titans (2020-22).
The Titans third-down percentage defense was ranked third in the NFL in 2022 and their opponents converted only 34.2 percent of their attempts.
The Titans defense tied for 10th in the NFL with 16 interceptions in 2021 and fourth in the NFL with 83 passes defensed.
In his first season with the Titans in 2020, the defense ranked seventh in the NFL with 15 interceptions.
Prior to joining the Titans, he spent six seasons with the Houston Texans, four as the assistant secondary coach (2014-17) and two as the secondary coach (2018-19).

Arthur Smith
Oﬀensive Coordinator
College: North Carolina
Experience: 17 years
Biography
Arthur Smith, previous head coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three years (2021-23),  is in his ﬁrst season as the Steelers' oﬀensive coordinator in 2024. This marks his 16th year in the National Football League coaching ranks.
Under Smith's guidance, the Falcons led the NFL in fewest penalties (2022), ranked third in successful play rate on rushing attempts, based on EPA, (2022), ﬁnished third in rushing yards/game (2022), ninth in rushing yards/game (2023), 10th in third-down conversion rate (2022), 13th in third-down conversion rate (2023) and 13th in passing yards/attempt (2023).
Atlanta eclipsed 400 total yards of oﬀense on six occasions in 2023, tied for the fourth-most in single-season franchise history. The Falcons and Miami were the only teams in the NFL to ﬁnish the season with a top-10 rushing attack and a top-ﬁve opponent pressure rate. Bijan Robinson ﬁnished the season second among rookies with 1,463 yards from scrimmage. He recorded the most yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (1,463) and led all NFL rookies with 976 rushing yards, while adding 487 receiving yards and eight TDs (four rushing, four receiving). Robinson set the franchise record for most receptions by a rookie running back (58) and became the ﬁfth rookie running back in League history to record at least 1,400 yards from scrimmage, 55 receptions and four receiving TDs. He also registered the most games with 100 yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (six).
Kyle Pitts (667) and Jonnu Smith (582) are the ﬁrst pair of tight ends to both have 500+ receiving yards in the same season since Zach Ertz (916) and Dallas Goedert (607) in 2019 with Philadelphia.
Atlanta's rushing attack averaged 74.5 more rushing yards per game in 2022 than it did in 2021, resulting in the largest one-season improvement by any team since at least 2001. Additionally, Tyler Allgeier became the sixth rookie in the NFL, selected in the ﬁfth round-or-later, to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards over the past 20 seasons.
First-round selection Drake London ﬁnished his rookie season in 2022 with 72 receptions for 866 yards and four TDs, surpassing Pitts (68 in 2021) for the most receptions by a rookie in franchise history. With Allgeier (1,035 rushing) and London (866 receiving), the Falcons became the fourth team to have a 1,000-yard rookie rusher and an 800-yard rookie receiver in the same season in NFL history.
In his ﬁrst year at the helm, running back Cordarrelle Patterson set single-season then career highs for rushing yards (618), receiving yards (548), rushing TDs (six) and receiving TDs (ﬁve), and became the ﬁrst player to record at least ﬁve rushing and ﬁve receiving TDs in a single season in franchise history.
Additionally, Pitts became the second rookie tight end to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in NFL history, joining Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Ditka (1,076 yards in 1961). Pitts broke the single-season franchise record for most receiving yards by a tight end with 1,026, surpassing Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez (930 in 2012). He also became the ﬁrst rookie tight end selected to the Pro Bowl since 2002 (Jeremy Shockey, N.Y. Giants).
Prior to his tenure in Atlanta, Smith orchestrated one of the NFL's top oﬀenses with Tennessee in 2019 and 2020.
In 2020, the Titans ranked in the top ﬁve in the League in plays of 50+ yards (10, 1st), pass plays of 50+ yards (8, 1st), oﬀensive EPA (140.01, 2nd), total oﬀense (396.4, 2nd), rushing oﬀense (168.1, 2nd), yards/rush (5.2, 2nd), red-zone eﬃciency (75.0, 2nd), rushing EPA (-0.42, 3rd), runs of 20+ yards (20, 3rd), yards/play (6.2, 4th), passing EPA (139.28, 4th), runs of 10+ yards (70, 4th) and third-down conversion rate (46.2, 5th).
Smith guided a Tennessee oﬀense that averaged 2.86 points/drive in 2020, which not only led the NFL, but also ranks as the eighth-best single-season mark in the League since 2000. The Titans scored TDs on 35.9% of its drives that season, which ranks as the fourth-best single-season mark in the League since 2000.
Smith also oversaw one of the most potent rushing attacks as Derrick Henry became just the eighth player in League history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a single season. Henry's 2,027 rushing yards ranks ﬁfth all-time and paced the Titans to the League's second-best rushing oﬀense in 2020.
Tennessee was among the League's best in the red zone in Smith's two-years as oﬀensive coordinator. The Titans' 75.6 (2019) and 75.0 (2020) red-zone TD percentages are the fourth and ﬁfth-best single-season marks in the NFL since 2000.
Smith also helped revitalize the career of Ryan Tannehill. In two seasons running Smith's oﬀense, Tannehill started 26 games and registered 6,561 passing yards with 55 TDs, 13 interceptions and a 110.6 passer rating, while completing 67.3 percent of his passes. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the ﬁrst time in his career in 2019 after leading the NFL with a 117.5 passer rating and was named the Comeback Player of the Year by both the Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers of America.
Smith also fostered the development of A.J. Brown, who eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in each of his ﬁrst two seasons in the NFL and scored 19 TDs in 30 games.
In 2019, Tennessee led the NFL in red-zone eﬃciency (75.6 percent), ranked third in rushing oﬀense (138.9 yards per game), and fourth in yards/play (6.12). The Titans' percentage in the red zone was the highest since the 2013 Denver Broncos (76.1). Tannehill and Henry became the fourth set of NFL teammates to lead the League in passer rating and rushing yards, respectively, since the current passer rating system was implemented in 1973.
Smith served under four diﬀerent Titans head coaches, working his way up from his 2011 position of defensive assistant/quality control coach. He also spent time as an oﬀensive assistant/quality control coach (2012), oﬀensive line/tight ends assistant (2013), and assistant tight ends coach (2014-15) before taking over as tight ends coach during the 2015 season and holding the position through 2018.
Prior to joining the Titans, Smith spent two years as the defensive quality control coach for the Washington Commanders under Joe Gibbs (2007-08). In addition to his coaching role, he also worked as a college scouting assistant in Washington in 2007. In 2010, Smith worked at Ole Miss as an administrative assistant/defensive intern, working primarily with the linebackers.
Born and raised in Memphis, Tenn., Smith graduated from North Carolina where he played oﬀensive line and later joined the Tar Heels coaching staﬀ as a graduate assistant (2006), working with the oﬀensive line.
Smith and his wife, Allison, have two sons, Tanner and Liam, and one daughter, Sophie.

Danny Smith
Special Teams Coordinator
College: Edinboro State
Experience: 29 years
Biography
Danny Smith is in his 11th season with the Steelers as the special teams' coordinator. Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.
Since joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 202-of-234 overall on field goal attempts (86.3%), including 90-of-115 (78.3%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks fifth in field goal percentage (86.3%) among all NFL kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts in league history. Boswell's 86.3 field goal percent ranks second in Steelers history among kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, behind only Shaun Suisham (2010-14: 124-141 for 87.9%). He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).
Danny Smith is in his 12th season with the Steelers as the special teams' coordinator. Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.
Since joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 231-of-265 overall on field goal attempts (87.2%), including 103-of-130 (79.2%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks second in field goal percentage (87.2%) among all NFL kickers with at least 250 field goal attempts since the start of the 2015 season. Boswell's 87.2 field goal percent ranks first in Steelers history among kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts. He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).
In 2023, Miles Killebrew was named First Team All-Pro by the Associated Press. He blocked a Baltimore punt that resulted in a safety in Week 5. Killebrew blocked a New England punt early in the fourth quarter that set up a Pittsburgh scoring drive in Week 14 (the punt went past the line of scrimmage so not officially a blocked punt). Since he signed with the Steelers in 2021, Killebrew's three blocked punts are tied for the most by any team in the League, let alone individual player. He leads the NFL with three punts blocked since the start of the 2021 season. His four career blocked punts are tied for the most by any active player in the League.
In 2022, Boswell made 20 field goals for the sixth time in his career, despite missing five games with an injury. His 59-yard field goal against the N.Y. Jets in Week 4 tied the longest make of his career. In Week 17 at Baltimore, Boswell became the second player in team history with at least 200 career field goals made.
In 2021, Boswell broke his own franchise record for most field goals made in a season in Steelers history (36). He also converted 8-of-9 attempts from 50+ yards, doubling his previous record of four makes from 50+ yards in a single season (2017).
Smith also oversaw the development of rookie punter Pressley Harvin in 2021. Harvin finished 10th in the League, landing 25 punts inside the 20-yard line as a rookie.
Under the guidance of Smith, Boswell made 19 field goals on 20 attempts (95.0%) in 2020, the best field goal percentage of his career in a single season. From 2019-2020, Boswell connected on 25-straight field goal attempts, which was the longest streak in the NFL when it ended in Week 11 of 2020 at Jacksonville.
Boswell made 29 of his 31 field goal attempts (93.5%) in 2019, including 29 of 30 from inside 54 yards and 10 of 12 from 40+ yards. He ranked tied for third in the NFL in field goals made, tied for fourth in field goals attempted and fourth in points (115). Among NFL kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, Boswell ranked second in field goal percentage.
Boswell was the only kicker in 2019 that did not miss an extra-point attempt (28 of 28) and connected on at least 90% of his field goal attempts. He was the first NFL kicker to accomplish the feat since 2017 and fifth to do so since 2015, when the extra-point attempt was moved to the 15-yard line.
Wide receiver and punt returner Diontae Johnson excelled under Smith's tutelage in 2019. The rookie led the NFL in punt-return average (12.4). Johnson was the fifth player in franchise history to lead the League and first since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. He returned a punt 85 yards for a TD at Arizona in Week 14, which was the longest punt return for a TD in franchise history. It was the first punt-return TD for the Steelers since December 6, 2015 (Antonio Brown vs. Indianapolis). Johnson was the first Pittsburgh rookie with a punt return for a TD since December 17, 2006 (Santonio Holmes vs. Carolina).
Boswell landed 13 successful field goals in 2018, following a 2017 season where he earned his first Pro Bowl selection after a record-setting campaign. Boswell established single-season franchise records for the most field goals made (35) and total points (142) during the 2017 season, in addition to setting a team record for the most field goals made from 50 yards or further in a season with four. His 35 field goals made and 142 points surpassed the previous milestones of Norm Johnson set in 1995 (34 and 141). Boswell converted four game-winning field goal attempts — kicks within one minute of regulation — during the 2017 regular season.
In 2016, Boswell tied the franchise's regular-season record for the most field goals made in a single game with six (12/18 at Cincinnati). Also in that contest, he set the franchise record for most field goals made from 40 yards or longer in a single game (five). Since 1960, his five made field goals from 40 yards or longer are tied for the most in a single game in NFL history (Mason Crosby, 11/22/15).
Boswell also set the NFL and Steelers record for most field goals made in a single postseason game (six) at Kansas City in the AFC Divisional Playoff. At the end of the 2016 postseason, Boswell was a perfect 15-of-15 in his playoff career. He became the first player in NFL postseason history to covert each of his first 15 field goal attempts.
Though Boswell had never kicked in an NFL game prior to his 2015 Steelers debut, he made 29 field goals and 26 PATs for a total of 113 points in just 12 games. He set rookie/first-year single-season team records in field goals made (29), points (113) and field goal percentage (90.6). Boswell's 29 made field goals tied for fifth on the team's single-season field goals made chart.
Prior to the 2015 regular season, the Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham for the season in the team's first preseason contest due to a knee injury. Pittsburgh then went through two other kickers (Garrett Hartley and Josh Scobee) before signing Boswell prior to the team's Week 5 game.
Through his first five years in the NFL and with the Steelers, punter Jordan Berry owns the team's single-season regular season record for highest net punting average (40.9, 2019). He ranks third in franchise history with a 44.2 punting average (min. 100 punts) and second in team annals with 131 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line.
Berry, who recorded a franchise record 40.9 net punting average, averaged a career-best 45.5 yards per punt in 2019.
In 2018, Berry tallied a 38.8 net punting average coming off a 2017 season in which he posted the second-best mark in team history with a 39.8 average.
In 2016, Berry set the team's single regular-season record for highest net punting average (40.2) and became the seventh Steeler in team history to land 50 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line in their career.
During the 2015 season, Berry established a Steelers' single-season record (since 1976) for the highest percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (47.5). That percentage also placed him third in the NFL.
In 2014, Smith got solid efforts from Suisham and punter Brad Wing. Suisham made 29-of-32 field goal attempts and all 45 of his PATs for a total of 132 points, good for fourth in the AFC. Wing averaged 43.7 yards per punt in his debut NFL season in 2014. His gross punting average was the fifth-highest total in team history for a rookie or first-year player in a single season.
In the Steelers' Week 17 showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFC North Championship was on the line. Smith's punt return units cleared the way for Antonio Brown to return a punt 71 yards for a TD. It marked the second straight season Brown returned a punt for a TD against Cincinnati.
In Smith's first season as the Steelers' special teams coordinator in 2013, Suisham had a career year, connecting on 30-of-32 field goals, which are a career high and are tied for the third-most field goals made in a single season in Steelers history. His 93.8 field goal percentage (minimum 15 attempts) also set a new single-season team record.
In addition to being selected to the Pro Bowl as a wide receiver in 2013, Brown was also selected as a return specialist. He recorded a 67-yard punt return for a TD in Week 15 versus Cincinnati, which was one of his five returns of 40 or more yards on the season.
Prior to joining Pittsburgh, Smith served as the Washington Football Team's special teams coordinator from 2004-2012. He helped establish Washington's special teams as one of the top coverage and return units in the NFL.
Prior to joining the Washington Football Team, Smith was the special teams coordinator for the Buffalo Bills (2001-03), coached tight ends for the Detroit Lions (1999-2000), and he split duties as the defensive backs and special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles (1995-98).
Smith spent eight years (1987-94) as an assistant coach for Georgia Tech, where he coached running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. He was on the staff for the Yellow Jackets' 1990 team that was named co-NCAA National Champions.
Smith played defensive back for Edinboro State College from 1972-1976, and he was elected to the Edinboro University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.
His first collegiate coaching position came as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1976. Smith also was a defensive graduate assistant coach at Clemson University (1979), The College of William & Mary (1980-83) and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina (1984-86).
Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Smith attended Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School. He coached at Central Catholic (1977-78), helping tutor future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino. Smith is married to Elaine, of Ambridge, Pa. They have three children, Erin, Courtney and Jason.

Eddie Faulkner
Running Backs Coach
College: Wisconsin
Experience: 5 years
Biography
Eddie Faulkner is in his fifth season as the running backs coach for the Steelers, after being hired on January 17, 2019.
In 2022, with Faulkner's guidance, Najee Harris was selected as a team captain in just his second NFL season. Harris eclipsed 1,000 rushing yards for the second consecutive season, becoming the first running back in franchise history to do so in each of his first two seasons. He racked up 428 career rushes before his first NFL fumble on a rush, which is the fifth most rushes without a fumble to open a career in NFL history.
Faulkner oversaw the development of Harris in 2021 who led the NFL in touches (377), led all NFL running backs in catches (74) and finished the season with the most rushes (307), rushing yards (1,200), catches and receiving yards (467) by a rookie running back in franchise history, culminating in a trip to the Pro Bowl.
In 2020, Faulkner's running backs included James Conner, who ran for 721 yards on 169 carries and six touchdowns. Conner registered a TD run in four consecutive games; he is the first Steeler to do so since Le'Veon Bell had a five-game TD streak over the 2013-14 seasons. He also recorded three 100+ yard games, including two consecutively, putting him at seventh all-time in Steelers' history for most 100-yard rushing games.
Prior to joining the Steelers, Faulkner spent six years, 2013-18, at NC State as the school's tight ends/fullbacks/special teams coordinator. In 2017, Faulkner was selected to participate in the NCAA Champion Forum as one of eight minority coaches in the nation chosen to participate in the professional development opportunity.
While at NC State, Faulkner coached the program's all-time receptions leader and current Steeler, running back Jaylen Samuels, who finished his career with 202 catches while earning first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors in 2015 and in 2017. In 2017, Samuels finished third in the conference with 16 TDs — the third-most in a season by a N.C. State footballer. Wolfpack running back Reggie Gallaspy II tied for fifth in the nation with 19 total TDs in 2018, scoring 18 on the ground.
Faulkner spent the 2012 season at the University of Wisconsin coaching the Badgers' tight ends. Under Faulkner's guidance, then junior Jacob Pederson won All-Big Ten honors and the League's Kwalick-Clark Tight End of the Year award, finishing as the school's second leading receiver.
In 2011, Faulkner held the running backs/special teams coordinator title at Northern Illinois University, where he mentored All-Mid-American Conference tailback Jasmin Hopkins. Hopkins produced 956 rushing yards and 15 TDs in 187 carries as the school's 234.1 rushing yards per game average ranked 12th in the nation.
Following a 2002 season as the running backs coach at Anderson University, Faulkner spent the 2003-10 campaigns at Ball State University, serving as a graduate assistant (2003-04), running backs/special teams (2005-08) and the offensive coordinator/running backs (2009-10), including a stint as the school's interim head coach at the end of the 2010 season.
While he was at Ball State, the Cardinals secured two MAC West Division championships and advanced to back-to-back bowl games for the first time in program history. In 2008, Ball State produced an undefeated regular-season record as tailback MiQuale Lewis tallied a school-record 1,736 rushing yards. Faulkner coached a duo to become the first in a single game in NCAA history to tally 500 rushing yards on Oct. 24, 2009 vs. Eastern Michigan (MiQuale Lewis: 301 and Cory Sykes: 203).
Faulkner, a member of two Big Ten championship teams as Wisconsin's running back, rushed for 1,064 yards and 7 TDs in his collegiate career from 1996-2000. During his Badgers' career, the team advanced to five consecutive bowl games, including back-to-back Rose Bowl appearances in 1999 and 2000. He spent the 2001 training camp with the Steelers as an undrafted free agent and the 2002 preseason with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League.

Karl Dunbar
Defensive Line Coach
College: Louisiana State University
Experience: 18 years
Biography
Karl Dunbar is in his sixth season as the Steelers' defensive line coach and his 17th year as a defensive line coach in the NFL. He was hired by the Steelers on February 8, 2018.
Dunbar helped the Steelers defense consistently improve throughout the course of the 2022 season, holding opponents to 17 points or less over its final seven games. Pittsburgh tied for fifth in sacks over the second half of the season, amassing 25.0 after their Bye Week in Week 9. T.J. Watt and Cameron Heyward both received Pro Bowl nods for their efforts.
Under the tutiledge of Dunbar, Watt became the seventh Steeler (eighth time) in franchise history to be named NFL Defensive Player of the Year, finishing the season with a league-leading 22.5 sacks and 21 TFL (tied with Nick Bosa). Veteran Heyward joined Watt for the pair's fifth consecutive Pro Bowl trip under Dunbar's tutelage.
In 2020, Dunbar's defensive line led the League in sacks (56.0), quarterback hits (136) and quarterback pressures (198). The Steelers tied a franchise record with at least 5.0 sacks in three straight games (Weeks 2-6) and continued their NFL record of 73 consecutive regular-season games with at least one sack. Pittsburgh's defense ranked in the top five in the NFL in six run-defense categories, including tackles for loss (103).
Watt worked with Dunbar on his pass rush during the season and finished 2020 with 15.0 sacks, 23 tackles for loss, and 41 quarterback hits. His 41 quarterback hits led the League in 2020 and tied for fifth since the NFL started recognizing the statistic in 2006.
Meanwhile, Dunbar continued to work closely with defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, who, along with T.J. Watt, was selected to the 2020 Pro Bowl. Heyward added 4.0 sacks to his resume in 2020, putting him at 58.0 in his career.
In 2019, Dunbar mentored Heyward, who was named All-Pro for the second time in his career (2017). Heyward finished the season with 9.0 sacks, 22 quarterback hits, 11 tackles for a loss and six passes defensed. Heyward not only led all NFL defensive tackles in stops with 83, but he also led the League in tackles by a defensive lineman. In fact, his 83 tackles were the most by a Steelers defensive lineman since Donald Evans had 84 in 1993.
Among NFL defensive tackles in '19, Heyward ranked second in quarterback hits, second in sacks and fourth in tackles for loss.
Another Dunbar protege, nose tackle Javon Hargrave, recorded 60 tackles, seven tackles for loss, six quarterback hits, 4.0 sacks and one forced fumble in 2019. Hargrave's 60 tackles were the most among all nose tackles in the NFL and ninth-most among defensive tackles. Among all NFL nose tackles in '19, Hargrave ranked tied for second in sacks, quarterback hits and tackles for loss.
Three members of Dunbar's positional group recorded at least 5.0 sacks each, led by defensive captain and first-year Pro Bowl selection Heyward. Heyward's 8.0 quarterback takedowns in 2018 led the defensive line, followed by Javon Hargrave (6.5), Stephon Tuitt (5.5) and Daniel McCullers (1.0). Pittsburgh's defense finished sixth among all NFL teams in rushing yards allowed and total yards allowed per game in 2018 (96.1 / 327.2), with just two running backs eclipsing 100 rushing yards against the Steelers on the season.
Dunbar re-entered the NFL coaching ranks after spending the two years as the defensive line coach at Alabama. He tutored a defensive line that helped the school capture the College Football Playoff National Championship following the 2017 campaign, and advanced to the title game after the 2016 season. The Crimson Tide led the nation in total defense and rush defense in 2017. In his first season, Alabama led the nation in rush defense and ranked fourth in sacks while recording a school-record 54.0 sacks.
Dunbar coached defensive line for the Buffalo Bills in 2015, where he reunited with defensive tackle Kyle Williams whom he coached at LSU.
Dunbar oversaw a defensive line with the N.Y. Jets for three seasons (2012-14) that featured the 2013 Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year — Sheldon Richardson — who also earned Pro Bowl honors in 2014. Muhammad Wilkerson, a Jets defensive lineman, also benefited greatly under Dunbar's guidance, posting a team-leading and career-high 10.5 sacks in 2013 — the most by a Jets defensive player since 2005. Wilkerson was named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press and a first alternate for the Pro Bowl.
Before joining the Jets, Dunbar served as the defensive line coach of the Minnesota Vikings from 2006-11. Minnesota's defense allowed the fewest rushing yards in the NFL (84.8 yards per game) and recorded the sixth-most sacks in the League (242.0) during Dunbar's six-year tenure. The Vikings' rush defense was the best in the NFL in three consecutive years from 2006-08, marking the first time since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger that a team had the number one rushing defense in three consecutive seasons.
Three Minnesota defensive linemen were selected to multiple Pro Bowls while Dunbar was the unit's position coach: defensive tackle Kevin Williams (5), defensive end Jared Allen (4) and defensive tackle Pat Williams (3). The trio earned the honor of being the first Viking triplet of defensive linemen to earn the Pro Bowl in the same season since 1969 in 2008 — a season in which they led the League in rushing defense for the third straight year.
In 2011, the Vikings' defense finish tied for the most sacks in the NFL with 50.0, an effort led by Allen's NFL-leading 22.0 sacks — just a half-sack shy of the League's single-season record.
The Vikings defense allowed just 985 rushing yards in Dunbar's second season with the franchise — setting a franchise record and ranking second in the NFL since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger behind the Ravens' 970 yards allowed in 2000.
In 2005, Dunbar coached the defensive line at Louisiana State University, which featured Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Kyle Williams.
Dunbar's first coaching stint in the NFL was with the Chicago Bears in 2004. He guided a young defensive line that included rookies Tommie Harris and Tank Johnson. Dunbar was the defensive line coach at Oklahoma State from 2002-03, where he mentored future Viking Kevin Williams and helped him become the program's first defensive lineman to be a first-round selection (ninth in 2003) since Leslie O'Neal (eighth in 1986).
He began his coaching career at Opelousas (La.) High School in 1986 before advancing to Beau Chene (La.) High School in 1997.
Dunbar, an eighth-round draft selection of the Steelers in 1990, played defensive line for two teams in his NFL career: New Orleans Saints (1992-93) and Arizona Cardinals (1994-95). He also played one season in NFL Europe (Rhein Fire, 1995).
Dunbar was a member of a LSU defense as a player while current Steelers Assistant Head Coach John Mitchell was on staff.
Dunbar and his wife, Pamela, have three children: Karmichael Mackenzie II, Mickel Angelle and Nickolette Alyse. A native of Opelousas, La., Dunbar graduated from LSU with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice.

Mike Sullivan
Senior Offensive Assistant
College: Army
Experience: 20 years
Biography
Mike Sullivan is in his third year as the team's quarterbacks coach. He was hired on Feb. 8, 2021. Sullivan will enter his 19th season as an NFL coach in 2023.
In his second season with the Steelers, Sullivan led in the development of 2022 first-round draft pick Kenny Pickett, who started the final 12 games of the season and led the team to a 7-5 finish as a starter, including five wins in his last six games.
During his first season in Pittsburgh, Sullivan worked with Ben Roethlisberger, capping off the final chapter of his 18-year resume in Pittsburgh with a postseason berth - the 12th of his career.
Sullivan has coached quarterbacks or coordinated offenses in Denver (2018), New York Giants (2010-11, 2015-17) and Tampa Bay (2012-13) prior to arriving in Pittsburgh. Sullivan also coached wide receivers in the League with the New York Giants (2004-09). He tutored five players that reached the Pro Bowl, including Odell Beckham Jr. (2016), Vincent Jackson (2012), Eli Manning (2011, '15), Doug Martin (2012) and Steve Smith (2009) over that time. He started coaching in the NFL with Jacksonville as a defensive quality control (2002) and offensive assistant (2003).
Sullivan, who was the Director of Recruiting for Army West Point in 2020, served as offensive coordinator for two years with the Giants under head coach Ben McAdoo. In 2017, Sullivan took over offensive play-calling for the team in Week 6 and continued that responsibility through the remainder of the year.
In his first season as offensive coordinator for the Giants in 2016, New York finished 11-5. Quarterback Eli Manning recorded his fifth 4,000-yard season under Sullivan and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. ranked third in the NFL with 1,367 receiving yards.
Before his second stint with the Giants, Sullivan spent two seasons as offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay's 2012 squad featured a 4,000-yard passer (Josh Freeman - 4,065 yards), a 1,000-yard rusher (Doug Martin – 1,454 yards) and a 1,000-yard receiver (Vincent Jackson – 1,384 yards). The Bucs finished that season ranked ninth in total offense, setting a franchise record by averaging 363.8 yards/game.
Sullivan won two Super Bowls—XLII (2007) and XLVI (2011)—during his first eight seasons with the Giants. He coached wide receivers for six seasons before being elevated to quarterbacks coach.
In the Giants' 2011 Super Bowl season—Manning's second year working with Sullivan—the quarterback set career highs in passing yards (4,933) and yards/attempt (8.4). In New York's four playoff games, Manning averaged more than 300 yards/game and finished the postseason with nine TDs against just one interception.
As wide receivers coach for the Giants, Sullivan worked with a pair of 1,000-yard receivers in Plaxico Burress (2005, '07) and Steve Smith (2009).
Sullivan coached for eight seasons in the collegiate ranks, beginning with a graduate assistant post at Humboldt State University in 1993. He coached linebackers at his alma mater, Army, from 1995-96 before moving on to coach defensive backs at Youngstown State University from 1997-98.
Sullivan returned to Army to coach defensive backs from 1999-2000 and then worked for one season as defensive backs coach at Ohio University before making a move to the NFL.
A former defensive back at Army, Sullivan is a graduate of the U.S. Army Airborne, Ranger and Air Assault schools.

Mike Tomlin
Head Coach
College: William and Mary
Experience: 23 years
Biography
Mike Tomlin was named the 16th head coach in Pittsburgh Steelers history on January 22, 2007. Hired at the age of 34, Tomlin became only the third head coach hired by the Steelers since 1969.
In his 16 seasons as head coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tomlin has accomplished many things that have never been done in the team's storied history. A franchise known for stability at the head coaching position, Tomlin ranks among the League's longest-tenured active head coaches entering the 2023 season.
Tomlin became the youngest head coach in NFL history to both coach in and win a Super Bowl when he led the Steelers to a 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII (36 years, 323 days), a record that held until it was eclipsed by Sean McVay in Super Bowl LVI (36 years, 20 days). By winning the Super Bowl in only his second season as a head coach, he also became the fastest to win a Super Bowl title in Steelers history.
During his head coaching tenue in Pittsburgh, Tomlin has led the Steelers to seven AFC North titles, most recently in 2020, and has guided the Steelers to the playoffs 10 times, including two trips to the Super Bowl (XLIII and XLV). Tomlin has won at least five home games in 15 of his first 16 years, including six in 2021. In his 16 seasons, he has never had a losing record.
Tomlin has sent a total of 73 selections to the NFL's annual Pro Bowl, including the three players who received Pro Bowl honors for the 2022 season. Additionally, Tomlin was appointed by Commissioner Roger Goodell to the NFL's Competition Committee in March 2013.
Tomlin is just the eighth coach in NFL history to win a Super Bowl within his first two seasons as head coach. He is the only head coach in Steelers history to lead the team to two Super Bowls in his first four seasons at the helm, including an appearance against the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV. He is one of only two Steelers head coaches to win three division titles in his first four seasons.
Tomlin has led Pittsburgh to a 163-93-2 record in the regular season since becoming the team's head coach in 2007 - the third-best record in the NFL during that time span, behind only Andy Reid and Bill Belichick. His 163-93-2 regular-season record (.636) is the best start in franchise history. Tomlin's 163 regular-season victories are the third-most among active NFL head coaches and 16th-most in League history. Tomlin's .636 regular-season win percentage is the 11th-highest in NFL history (minimum 100 games).
Tomlin is one of four active NFL head coaches with over 160 victories and one of five active NFL head coaches to defeat at least 31 current NFL franchises.
Tomlin's young 2022 team improved dramatically over the course of the season, culminating in Tomlin's 16th-straight season of .500 or above with a record of 9-8. The Steelers started the season at 2-6 before their Week 9 bye, and went 7-2 the rest of the way. Pittsburgh's offense boasted the best third-down conversion rate and the third-most rushing yards in the League from Weeks 10 through 18 after starting the season ranked 24th in both categories. Defensively, Pittsburgh improved from ranking 29th in opponent yards per game to the stingiest defense in the League over the second half of the season, allowing an NFL-best 272.9 yards per game following their bye week. The Steelers defense also improved in getting off the field over the last nine weeks, allowing the third-least third-down conversions (36) and and tying for the second-most interceptions (12). The team's 20 interceptions on the season tied for the most in the League.
In 2021, Tomlin led the Steelers to a 9-7-1 record and captured a playoff berth for the 10th time in his Steelers career. For the fifth-straight season, the Steelers led the NFL in sacks (55). The Pittsburgh defense sat atop the League in red zone defense allowing touchdowns on just 50.14% of red zone trips. Offensively, Pat Freiermuth and Najee Harris set several rookie franchise records and were two of five rookies starting in Week 1 of the season.
In 2020, Tomlin became one of just two head coaches in NFL history to begin a head coaching tenure with at least 14 consecutive non-losing seasons -- joining Marty Schottenheimer (14, 1984-97). The Steelers began the season with an 11-0 win-streak, which culminated in a 12-4 regular-season record and Tomlin's ninth AFC North title. The 11-game winning streak (9/14/20-12/2/20) tied the longest regular season winning streak in franchise history. Over the past six seasons (2013-20), Tomlin has led the team to a 26-13 record in the month of December/January.
The Steelers offense dramatically improved in 2020, scoring at least 24 points in 11 regular season games after hitting the mark just five times in 2019. However, it was Pittsburgh's defense that once again showed its teeth, either topping or sharing the league lead in 20 different defensive categories including tackles for loss (103), sacks (56.0), interceptions (18), passes defensed (84), quarterback pressures (198), defensive completion percentage (56.7%) and opposing QB rating (76.7). The unit also finished second in takeaways (27) and third in scoring defense (19.5).
Finishing the regular season as the AFC's No. 3 seed, Pittsburgh produced five Pro Bowlers - offensive linemen Maurkice Pouncey and David DeCastro and defenders Minkah Fitzpatrick, Cameron Heyward and T.J. Watt - marking the fourth consecutive season in which at least five Steelers were named to the Pro Bowl.
Pittsburgh was beset with injuries in 2019. The Steelers lost quarterback Ben Roethlisberger with a season-ending elbow injury in Week 2. Running back James Conner missed six games, wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster missed four games, and was sidelined for the majority of two others, and defensive end Stephon Tuitt missed the final 10 games of the season. Even backups -- quarterback Mason Rudolph and running back Jaylen Samuels missed multiple games. Starting center Maurkice Pouncey missed three games. Starting left guard Ramon Foster and starting tight end Vance McDonald were both sidelined two games for concussions. Undrafted rookie free-agent Devlin Hodges was forced to play in eight games (six starts), and, despite an 0-3 start, Tomlin still led Pittsburgh to a record of 8-8.
Despite injuries, Pittsburgh's defense led or tied for the League-lead in sacks (54.0), quarterback hits (117), takeaways (36), fumble recoveries (17) and rush TDs allowed (7). The Steelers also ranked among the NFL's top-five in interceptions (2nd, 20), interception rate (2nd, 3.89%), passing defense (3rd, 194.6), yards per play allowed (3rd, 4.74), passes defensed (3rd, 83), yards per rush allowed (3rd, 3.79), forced fumbles (t-3rd, 19), tackles for loss (t-3rd, 90), opposing passer rating (4th, 80.7), pass yards per attempt allowed (4th, 6.06), total defense (5th, 304.1), scoring defense (t-5th, 18.9) and offensive TDs allowed (5th, 30).
During the 2019 season, Tomlin reached 125 career wins in the fewest games (192) in team history, tying him with Bud Grant for the fifth-fewest games by an NFL head coach to secure 125 regular season wins. He was the third head coach in NFL history with 133 or more regular season wins in their first 13 seasons as a head coach, joining Tony Dungy: 139 and Shula: 138.
Tomlin led the Steelers to a record of 9-6-1 in 2018. With a Week 5 win against Atlanta, he and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger broke a tie with Chuck Noll and Terry Bradshaw for the most wins by a head coach-quarterback tandem in franchise history. The duo's 127 regular-season wins (2007-20) are now third-most by a head coach-quarterback pairing in NFL history, trailing only the tandems of Sean Payton/Drew Brees and Bill Belichick/Tom Brady.
Roethlisberger set single-season franchise records for touchdown passes (34), pass completions (452) and passing yards (5,129) in 2018, while leading all NFL players in pass completions and passing yardage. Wide receiver Antonio Brown led the NFL with a single-season franchise record 15 TD catches. Brown and second-year wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster also made history, becoming the sixth wide receiver duo in NFL history and first in Steelers history to record 100 receptions and 1,000 yards apiece in a single season. Smith-Schuster was voted Team MVP for his breakout year.
With Tomlin at the helm, six Steelers were named to the Pro Bowl for their 2018 performances — the third consecutive season with at least five selections. Brown, running back James Conner, defensive tackle Cameron Heyward and offensive linemen DeCastro, Maurkice Pouncey and Villanueva all received Pro Bowl accolades.
In 2017, Tomlin led the Steelers to a 13-3 record, including a 6-0 record against the AFC North, securing his sixth division title and a No. 2 seed in the AFC for the postseason. The team's 13 wins marked the most wins in a single season in the Tomlin era.
Under Tomlin's guidance, Roethlisberger became the eighth quarterback in NFL history to reach 50,000 passing yards, finishing the 2017 season with a career total of 51,065. Brown was voted team MVP for his outstanding performance and became the first Steeler to earn the honor four times (2011, '13, '15 and '17). Brown led the league with 1,533 receiving yards and set an NFL record for the most receptions (582) and receiving yards (7,848) by a player in any five-year span in League history. For the second straight season, running back Le'Veon Bell led the AFC in scrimmage yards per game (129.7) and sur- passed his own Steelers single-season record for receptions by a running back with 85. Defensively, the team led the NFL and set a Steelers single-season record with 56 sacks in 2017.
For their efforts, Roethlisberger, Brown and Bell were named to the Pro Bowl along with kicker Chris Boswell, linebacker Ryan Shazier, and offensive linemen DeCastro, Maurkice Pouncey and Villanueva. Brown, Bell and DeCastro were also named AP All-Pro, along with Heyward. Heyward and fullback Roosevelt Nix were also added to the Pro Bowl roster prior to the game.
The Steelers finished with an 11-5 record in 2016, and won each of the team's final seven regular- season games, to secure the AFC North title and No. 3 seed in the AFC for the postseason. It marked the fifth time Tomlin led the Steelers to at least 11 wins in the regular season. Pittsburgh won its first two postseason games, vs. Miami in an AFC Wild Card Game and at Kansas City in an AFC Divisional Playoff, before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.
Bell was voted the Steelers' MVP for his 2016 efforts. He led the NFL in scrimmage yards per game (157.0), and he became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 3,000 rushing yards and 1,500 receiving yards in his career (38 games). In the Steelers' Week 14 victory at Buffalo in 2016, Bell set the single- game team record with 236 rushing yards and tied the single-game team mark with three rushing TDs.
Roethlisberger and Brown continued to etch their names in NFL history. Roethlisberger finished the season with the ninth-most passing TDs in NFL history (301) and the 10th-most passing yards in NFL history (46,814). Brown set numerous NFL records, including one for the most receptions in a player's first 100 career regular-season games (622) and one for the most receptions in NFL history by a player in any four-year span (481).
Tomlin also reached his 100th career win in 2016 and did so in the fewest games (157) in team history. He became the eighth head coach in NFL history to reach 100 regular-season wins in their first 10 seasons.
Despite significant injuries to multiple starters during the 2015 season, the Steelers finished with a 10-6 record (2nd in the AFC North) and advanced to the Divisional Round of the playoffs. The Steelers finished third in the NFL in total offense (1st in the AFC), while the defense posted 48 sacks under first- year defensive coordinator Keith Butler. The 48 sacks were the third most in the NFL in 2015.
In 2014, Tomlin orchestrated one of the top offensive outputs in team history. The Steelers broke numerous offensive records, including points scored (436), total yards (6,577), passing yards per game (301.6) and total first downs (379). On an individual basis in 2014, Tomlin guided Roethlisberger, Brown and Bell — who all made the Pro Bowl — to record-setting years.
Arguably one of his best coaching performances may have come in the second half of the 2013 season. Despite an 0-4 and 2-6 start to the season, the Steelers finished the regular season surging to a 6-2 second-half record, falling just short of the playoffs.
In 2012, Tomlin led the Steelers to a 27-10 victory over the New York Jets in the home opener, becoming the first coach in team history to win his first six home openers. The Steelers finished the season with the top-ranked overall defense (275.8 yards/game) and finished first in passing defense (185.2 yards/game).
In 2011, Tomlin led the Steelers to a 12-4 record, marking the second straight season the team posted 12 wins, which was only the second time in team history it had been achieved. The Steelers finished the season with the top-ranked total defense (271.8 ypg) and scoring defense (14.2 ppg). Pittsburgh posted a 7-1 record at home in 2011, for the second time in Tomlin's career (2007). He also had five players (Roethlisberger, Mike Wallace, Pouncey, Troy Polamalu and Brown) selected to the Pro Bowl following the season.
Tomlin's seven road wins during the 2010 regular season tied a Steelers record previously set in 1978 and 2004. The Steelers finished second in total defense under Tomlin's guidance in 2010, allowing only 276.8 yards per game. Pittsburgh led the NFL and set a team record in rushing defense, yielding only 62.8 yards per game (1,004 yards), the third-best total in NFL history dating back to 1970. The Steelers also established an NFL record in 2010 by not allowing an opponent to rush for more than 75 yards in any of their first eight games during the regular season.
In all, the Steelers' defense led the NFL in 2010 in rushing yards allowed (62.8 yds./game), points allowed (232), touchdowns allowed (22), quarterback sacks (48), rushing average (3.0), yards per play (4.5) and yards allowed on first down (4.08). It finished second in the league in passing average (6.31), turnover advantage (+14) and red-zone efficiency (40.0, tied).
Under Tomlin, the Steelers broke new ground on offense in 2009. Pittsburgh's offense ranked seventh in the NFL (ninth passing, 19th rushing) but became the first unit in team history to boast a 4,000-yard passer (Roethlisberger), two 1,000-yard receivers (Hines Ward, Santonio Holmes) and a 1,000-yard rusher (Rashard Mendenhall) in the same season. Pittsburgh's defense ranked fifth in the NFL (third vs. run, 16th vs. pass) while leading the AFC and finishing one shy of the NFL lead with 47 quarterback sacks.
The Steelers continued to be dominant at home under Tomlin in 2009. Pittsburgh finished with a 6-2 home record after finishing 7-1 (2007) and 6-2 (2008) at home during Tomlin's first two seasons.
Tomlin finished the 2008 season with a 12-4 record and his second consecutive AFC North Division title, becoming the only Steelers head coach to win division crowns in each of his first two seasons. He also set a record with 22 regular-season wins in his first two years at the helm and is the only Steelers head coach to win at least 10 games in each of his first two seasons. Tomlin's .688 winning percentage (22-10) after two years is the best in Steelers history.
The Steelers' defense was dominant under Tomlin's guidance in 2008, leading the NFL in total defense (237.2), pass defense (156.9), points per game (13.9), total yards per play (3.9), rushing yards per attempt (3.3), passing yards per attempt (4.7) and third-down efficiency (31.4), while finishing second in rush defense (80.3).
Tomlin led the Steelers to a 10-6 record in 2007 and became just the second coach in team history to post a winning record, win a division title and earn a playoff berth in his inaugural season. Tomlin began his head coaching career by becoming only the second Steelers head coach to win his first three games. During 2007, the Steelers became just the fifth team in NFL history to win their first four home games by at least 20 points.
Tomlin guided the Steelers to the NFL's top-ranked defense in 2007, yielding only 266.4 yards per game. The Steelers' defense ranked third in the NFL against both the run (89.9 avg.) and the pass (176.5 avg.), and finished third in the league in total yards allowed per play (4.6). Pittsburgh's defense led the NFL in passing yards per play (5.7) and first downs allowed per game (15.6), and finished second in the league in points allowed per game (16.8).
The Steelers' offense finished third in the NFL in rushing (135.5 avg.) during Tomlin's first season, sparked by Willie Parker, who led the league in rushing before injuring his leg in Week 16. Roethlisberger enjoyed a record-setting season during Tomlin's first year, establishing new team records for TD passes (32) and passer rating (104.1) while earning his first career Pro Bowl appearance.
Tomlin was the NFL's second-youngest head coach in 2007, and he became only the second Steelers coach in team history to win at least 10 games during his first year at the helm. The Steelers posted a 7-1 record at home in 2007 and were 5-1 in the AFC North (3-0 at home).
Tomlin spent the 2006 season as the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator. That season, the Vikings ranked eighth in the NFL in total defense and first against the run while not allowing a 100-yard rusher the entire season.
Tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2001-05. In 2002, Tomlin guided one of the most productive defensive backfields in the NFL, culminating with its performance in Super Bowl XXXVII. The secondary recorded four of the team's five interceptions, returning two for touchdowns, to help Tampa Bay capture the franchise's first Super Bowl title.
Before joining Tampa Bay's staff, Tomlin served two seasons as the defensive backs coach at the University of Cincinnati (1999-00). He took over a secondary that ranked 111th in the nation in pass defense in 1998 and helped them improve to 61st overall in his first season. Under Tomlin's direction in 2000, the Bearcats ranked eighth in the nation in interceptions as well as fourth nationally in total turnovers.
Prior to joining the Cincinnati staff, Tomlin had a short stint on the coaching staff at Tennessee-Martin and then spent two seasons at Arkansas State, coaching wide receivers in 1997 before switching to defensive backs in 1998.
Tomlin spent the 1996 season as a graduate assistant at the University of Memphis, where he worked with the Tiger defensive backs and special teams units. He began his coaching career in 1995 as wide receivers coach at Virginia Military Institute.
Tomlin was a three-year starter at wide receiver at William & Mary (1990-94) and finished his career with 101 receptions for 2,054 yards and 20 TD catches. A first-team All-Yankee Conference selection in 1994, he established a school record with a 20.2 yards-per-catch average.
Tomlin is very active in the community and was recognized, along with his wife Kiya, in February 2013 by the Chuck Cooper Foundation with the Career Achievement in Leadership Diversity and Community Service Award. Tomlin also participates in the annual ManUp Pittsburgh conference which encourages local men to be better fathers and role models.

Pat Meyer
Offensive Line Coach
Experience: 11 years
Biography
Pat Meyer is entering his second season as the Steelers' offensive line coach in 2022. He was hired by Pittsburgh on February 15, 2022.
Meyer, who boasted 20 years of coaching experience prior to his arrival in Pittsburgh, including nine in the NFL, came to the Steelers after two seasons with the Carolina Panthers as their offensive line coach (2020-21). He also coached offensive line in the NFL with the L.A. Chargers (2017-19) and Chicago Bears (2013-14).
In his first year heading up the Steelers' offensive line, the run game improved from ranking 24th in the League through the first half of the season, to finishing third-best after Week 10.
In 2020 and 2021, Meyer's offensive line unit battled considerable injuries and the absence of Pro Bowl running back Christian McCaffrey. Carolina was forced to use 14 different offensive line combinations of starters in '21. In '20, the group still helped running back Mike Davis have a breakout season, eclipsing 1,000 scrimmage yards for the first time in his career.
Right tackle Taylor Moton, the only Panther offensive lineman to start all 17 contests in 2021, started 16 games at right tackle and one at left tackle in 2020. He also played every snap during the '20 season and, according to PFF, posted the third pass-blocking efficiency rating among qualified NFL tackles and ranked sixth in fewest pressures allowed (20) among qualified tackles.
Prior to Carolina, Meyer served as the offensive line coach for the Chargers for three years. During the 2018 season, Meyer helped lead the offense to its highest rushing total since 2013 (1,873 yards). Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers tied his career-best single-season passer rating of 105.5. In 2017, Meyer's unit allowed a league-low 17 sacks, the franchise's fewest sacks since the 1982 season. That year, Rivers also finished second in the NFL in passing yards (4,515), and the offensive line paved the way for the team's first 1,000-yard rusher since 2013 (Melvin Gordon). Over his three years with the Chargers, Meyer helped coach center Mike Pouncey to a 2018 Pro Bowl appearance and tackle Russell Okung to back-to-back Pro Bowl honors in 2017 and 2018.
Meyer spent two seasons with the Buffalo Bills (2015-16), first serving as a football operations consultant before transitioning to a role as an offensive assistant.
Meyer got his start in the NFL with the Chicago Bears, first as an assistant offensive line coach in 2013 before taking over the primary coaching duties in 2014. Under his watch, Bears' guard Kyle Long earned back-to-back Pro Bowl bids. In 2013, Meyer's offensive line allowed just 30 sacks, finishing the year tied for the fourth-fewest in the League.
Meyer spent one season in the Canadian Football League in 2012, where he served as offensive line coach and offensive coordinator for the Montreal Alouettes and helped the team become one of the league's most explosive offenses. The Alouettes finished the year first in the CFL in touchdowns, second in passing and third in overall scoring.
Prior to his stint in the CFL, Meyer spent over a decade in a variety of collegiate coaching positions. Meyer got his start in coaching as a graduate assistant at Memphis in 1997, where he served multiple roles, including offensive assistant, assistant strength coach and director of strength and conditioning.
Meyer led the strength and conditioning program at NC State for six years (2000-05) before taking over the Wolfpacks' offensive line coaching duties in 2006.
In 2007, Meyer headed the strength and conditioning staff at Florida State. He returned to his alma mater, Colorado State, where he served as the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach for the Rams for three seasons (2008-11).
Meyer played offensive line at Colorado State from 1991-94, where he was a three-time All-Western Athletic Conference selection. In 1995, Meyer went undrafted and spent a year with the Arizona Cardinals before later playing in the Arena Football League.

McCurley most recently served as the linebackers coach for the Dallas Cowboys for ﬁve seasons (2020-24). With the Cowboys, McCurley guided a linebacker unit that accounted for 22 of the team's 52 sacks during the 2024 season, which was the third-highest total in the NFL. His group was led by Micah Parsons, who recorded a team-best 12.0 sacks on the season, becoming the ﬁrst player since Reggie White in 1982 to record at least 12.0 sacks in their ﬁrst four seasons. Parsons went on to be named to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl in 2024.
In 2023, the Cowboys defense surrendered 104 missed tackles, which were the fewest missed tackles in the NFL that season. McCurley's group was part of a defense that led the NFL in takeaways in 2021 (34) and 2022 (33), which was the ﬁrst time a team led the League in takeaways in consecutive seasons since the Steelers from 1972-74.
McCurley's second season with the Cowboys linebackers was highlighted by the 2021 ﬁrst round selection Micah Parsons. Parsons went on to produce one of the best years by a rookie in NFL history, totaling a franchise rookie record 13.0 sacks, tied for the third-most by a rookie in NFL history. He became the ﬁrst player in team history to be named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.
His ﬁrst year with Dallas in 2020 saw linebacker Jaylon Smith ﬁnish with a team-high 160 tackles, which was the second-most in the NFL. The Cowboys ﬁnished seventh in the NFL with 23 takeaways that season.
Prior to his time with the Cowboys, he spent 13 seasons with the Green Bay Packers working as a defensive assistant (2018), assistant linebackers coach (2014-17), defensive quality control coach (2009-13) and in coaching administration (2006-08). He spent the 2019 season away from football.

In 2017, Martinez led Green Bay with 158 tackles and 12 tackles for a loss. In 2015, McCurley helped utilize the versatility of Clay Matthews in a switch to middle linebacker, as he started all 16 games for the ﬁrst time in his career and made his sixth Pro Bowl with a career-high 85 tackles along with 6.5 sacks, both second on the team.
During his time as quality control coach with the Packers, McCurley assisted with various positions throughout the defense.
McCurley started his NFL career as a coaching admin with the Packers from 2006-08.
Prior to joining the Packers, McCurley enjoyed a lengthy playing and coaching career at the University of Pittsburgh. Originally a walk-on athlete who redshirted his ﬁrst year, McCurley earned a scholarship after his freshman season. He lettered all four years at linebacker (1999-2002) and earned a spot on the 1999 Big East All-Academic team. After graduating in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in movement science with a coaching minor, McCurley remained with the program as a defensive graduate assistant, where the 2004 team he coached won the Big East championship and a spot in the Fiesta Bowl.

Teryl Austin
Defensive Coordinator
College: University of Pittsburgh
Experience: 20 years
Biography
Teryl Austin is in his second season as the Steelers' defensive coordinator. He was promoted after three seasons as the Steelers' senior defensive assistant/secondary coach on February 6, 2022. This marks his 20th year in the National Football League coaching ranks.
Under the guidance of Austin, Pittsburgh improved from ranking 29th in opponent yards per game to the stingiest defense in the League over the second half of the 2022 season, allowing an NFL-best 272.9 yards per game following their bye week. The Steelers defense also improved in getting off the field through the last nine weeks, allowing the third-least third-down conversions (36) and tying for the second-most interceptions (12). The team's 20 interceptions on the season tied for the most in the League.
In 2021, six different Steelers' defensive backs were responsible for interceptions, while five forced at least one fumble. Pro Bowl safety Minkah Fitzpatrick led the team with 124 tackles on the season.
Austin coached a group of defensive backs that helped Pittsburgh's defense rank as one of the NFL's best in 2020. The Steelers limited 11 opponents below a 60.0 completion percentage, which led all teams for the season. Pittsburgh's opponents averaged a 56.7 completion percentage and a 76.7 average quarterback ranking. Both marks not only led the NFL but were the lowest by a Pittsburgh defense since 2011. The Steelers also finished near the top of the League in interceptions (t-1st, 18), takeaways (2nd, 27), games with multiple takeaways (1st, 11) and passes defensed (1st, 84).
Fitzpatrick was named both a Pro-Bowler and AP All-Pro for the second season in a row. Fitzpatrick had five takeaways (four interceptions and one fumble recovery), which ranked sixth in the NFL.
In 2019, Pittsburgh ranked top-five in the NFL in interceptions (2nd, 20), interception rate (2nd, 3.89%), pass defense (3rd, 194.6), yards per play allowed (3rd, 4.72), passes defensed (3rd, 99), opposing passer rating (4th, 79.7), pass yards per attempt allowed (4th, 6.06), total defense (5th, 304.1) and scoring defense (5th, 18.9).
Fitzpatrick, who was named All-Pro, had five interceptions, two forced fumble and three fumble recoveries in 2019. His eight total takeaways (interceptions and fumble recoveries) led the NFL. He recorded defensive TDs in back-to-back games, including a 96-yard interception return for a TD against the Colts (Nov. 3) and a 43-yard fumble return for TD against the Rams (Nov. 10).
Cornerback Joe Haden recorded 65 tackles, 17 passes defensed, five interceptions, three tackles for loss, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery in 2019. Haden ranked tied for fourth in the NFL in passes defensed, interceptions and total takeaways (five interceptions, one fumble recovery).
Prior to his time in Pittsburgh, Austin served as defensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions (2014-17), before a one-year stint in the same role with the Cincinnati Bengals (2018).
As defensive coordinator for the Lions (2014-17), Austin's defensive units ranked in the Top-10 among all NFL teams in total yards per game allowed (340.3/10th), rushing yards per game allowed (100.3/8th) and the number of games in which opponents were held to 20 points or less (34/tied for 6th).
In 2017, the Lions finished third in the NFL with 32 takeaways, tied for second in fumble recoveries (13) and tied for fifth with a +10 turnover differential. In 2016, Austin's defensive squad helped the team advance to the playoffs as the unit tied for second in the NFL by holding opposing offenses to 21 points or less in 10 games. In 2014, his first season as an NFL defensive coordinator, Austin coordinated one of the League's most dominant defenses, finishing first in rush defense (69.3 yards per game), second in total defense (300.9 yards per game) and third in scoring defense (17.6 points per game).
Prior to his time with Detroit, Austin served as a defensive backs coach for a combined 10 years with three NFL teams: Seattle Seahawks (2003-06), Arizona Cardinals (2007-09) and Baltimore Ravens (2011-13). In each of his three stops as a position coach, Austin helped lead his team to Super Bowl appearances (Seattle in 2005 and Arizona in 2008), while securing a 2012 Championship with Baltimore.
From 2011-13, Austin served as the secondary coach of the Ravens, developing the secondary into an integral part of one of the NFL's most consistent defenses in recent years. In 2012, Austin's secondary helped advance the Ravens to its Super Bowl XLVII Championship run. In his first season with Baltimore, in 2011, the Ravens yielded a league-low 11 passing TDs and surrendered the third-fewest points per game (16.6), tying an NFL record by ranking in the top three in points allowed for the fourth consecutive campaign.
In 2010, Austin served at the helm of the University of Florida's defense, which recorded 22 interceptions — the fourth-most in the nation — returning four for TDs. The Gators' 538 interception return yards were the most in the nation. Austin's unit led the SEC in conference games, allowing just 310.8 yards per game, including 175.5 passing.
Three of Austin's defensive backs with the Arizona Cardinals earned Pro Bowl honors in 2009: CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, S Antrel Rolle and S Adrian Wilson. Austin helped guide Rodgers-Cromartie, the team's first-round pick in 2008, to a team-best four interceptions in the regular season and two during the playoffs. In 2007, the Cardinals led the League with six interceptions returned for TDs and 551 interception return yards.
Austin played a key role in the development of the Seahawks' young secondary during his 2003-06 tenure in Seattle. Seattle's defense produced 67 interceptions over Austin's four-year span, tying for the 10th-most in the NFL from 2003-07.
Austin's college coaching career began as a graduate assistant at Penn State (1991-92). He held stints as the defensive backs coach at Wake Forest (1993-95), Syracuse (1996-98) and Michigan (1999-2002). Austin was a three-year starter and four-year letterman at safety for the University of Pittsburgh from 1983-87. He earned a bachelor's degree in communications from Pittsburgh in 1988. Austin played for the Montreal Machine of the World League of American Football in 1991, after attending training camps with the Washington Football Team and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (CFL).
Austin, a native of Sharon, Pa., attended Sharon (Pa.) High School. He and his wife, April, have five children, including sons Tyler, Trey and Torin, and daughters Alexa and Alivia.
