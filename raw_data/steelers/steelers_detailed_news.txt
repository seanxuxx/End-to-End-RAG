Steelers hope to keep ground game momentum going
Contributing Writer/Editor
When the Steelers added Mitch Trubisky in free agency and selected Kenny Pickett in the first round of the NFL Draft, they knew they were adding a mobility factor to the quarterback position they hadn't had in several years.
In Sunday's 20-10 win over the New Orleans Saints, the fruits of that added mobility at the position showed themselves as Pickett rushed for a career-high 51 yards on eight attempts and the Steelers had their best rushing day since gaining 240 yards against Buffalo in 2016.
They also got 99 yards on 20 carries from Najee Harris and 37 on nine attempts from Jaylen Warren as the offensive line got a significant push throughout the game against the Saints.
"I thought Naj ran well. I thought our line ran off the ball," Mike Tomlin said Tuesday at his weekly press conference at the UPMC-Rooney Sports Complex.
"I thought we got hats on hats. I thought Jaylen was solid, as well. The prudent use of quarterback mobility added to that. Kenny did a nice job running and extending while taking care of the football while doing so. That teed up possession downs. At times, it kept us out of third-down situations, just being able to possess the ball. Time of possession reflected that."
The Steelers held the ball for nearly 39 minutes in the game, converting 9 of 17 third downs and adding a fourth down conversion to the equation.
The opposing team will have a tough time scoring if it's not on the field.
"The best defense is one that's standing on the sideline," Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward said Sunday after the team improved to 3-6.
That certainly wasn't the case the last time the Steelers faced this week's opponent, the Cincinnati Bengals (5-4), in Week 1.
The Bengals ran 91 plays in that game to 64 for the Steelers and held the ball for 43:43 compared just over 26 minutes for Pittsburgh. But the Steelers came away with a 23-20 overtime win because they forced five turnovers, blocked a PAT attempt and generally disrupted the game with their defense.
But running the ball and controlling the game that way has become more en vogue again in today's NFL.
Currently 15 teams are averaging 120 or more yards rushing per game, the most in nearly two decades if this holds up over the course of the season.
And quarterback mobility has become a big part of that. The seven leading rushing teams in the NFL this season have all gotten 178 or more yards out of the quarterback position on the ground.
The Steelers, who got just 58 rushing yards out of the quarterback position in 2021, 53 of which came from backup Mason Rudolph, haven't had that be a part of their attack in quite some time. Ben Roethlisberger hadn't gained more than 172 yards rushing in a season since 2010.
Just don't expect the Steelers, who are now averaging 108.4 rushing yards per game this season after their outburst Sunday, to start designing a bunch of plays that call for Pickett to run the ball – outside of quarterback sneaks.
"I think every time I say quarterback mobility, I say the prudent use of quarterback mobility," Tomlin said. "I do so intentionally because there is risk associated with that. And risk is something we all weigh. Any of us that have mobility at the quarterback position, that's a component of the equation each and every week. Mobility is a good thing, but when and how to use it while managing the risk component of it is also an element of the equation."
More important to Tomlin is being able to line up and run the ball when the Steelers want to do so. And the team has gained some momentum there, rushing for 361 yards in its past two games.
The offensive line, which included two new starters in center Mason Cole and guard James Daniels at the start of the season, might be starting to come together as a run blocking unit.
"Just the nature in which they put four hands on people. The movement we're getting when we choose to double (team), and the understanding of the timing of when to come off and when to not come off double teams," Tomlin said when asked where he's seen improvement from that group.
"That's just born out of cooperative work, one man working with another. It's been fun to watch the cohesion come together between (James Daniels) and Chuks (Okorafor), for example. But that has to happen for a right guard and right tackle. Oftentimes, they're double teaming B-gap players, come together and deal with the linebackers, however they show themselves. I just see collective growth and development in some of the work at that position."
It's a positive sign moving forward with this season.
The Bengals limited the Steelers to 75 yards on 22 carries in that season-opening win, so Sunday's meeting will be a good litmus test to see how far the running game as a whole has come.
Not that the offensive line is looking for any kudos for that.
"They're not a group that looks for acknowledgement. They understood the type of attention that was going to be on them because so many of them were knew and because the collective development was going to be a process," Tomlin said. "In the midst of that, we needed to be productive enough and show resolve and collective commitment. They've done that. And as long as they continue to do that, it's reasonable to expect the growth and development to continue in all areas, not just the run game."

T * hings looking up for Fitzpatrick: * Minkah Fitzpatrick missed last Sunday's win over the Saints after undergoing an appendectomy on Saturday.
Veteran Damontae Kazee, who was returning from the Reserve/Injured List, started in his place.
But Tomlin said there's a solid chance Fitzpatrick could be available this week against the Bengals.
"Reports regarding Minkah and his inclusion this week are really positive. I know he has already been here and run today," Tomlin said. "I saw him Sunday at the stadium, and Minkah wanted to play on Sunday. Obviously that was not the appropriate to do, but that's the mentality that he brings. Often times, when you're talking about injury or lack of availability, you're attitude has a lot to do with it. We're really optimistic about him."
Tomlin said Harris (knee soreness) an guard Kevin Dotson (hip) might be slowed early in the week, but are expected to play Sunday. Cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon (hamstring) will continue to be monitored.
W * att's presence felt: * Like Kazee, linebacker T.J. Watt returned off the Reserve/Injured List Sunday. And though Watt had four tackles, including one for a loss, and did not record a sack – just missing one on which Andy Dalton scrambled for a one-yard gain, the presence of reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year had a positive effect on the defense.
The Steelers allowed a season-low 186 yards in the game.
"There's an intangible quality to players like him," Tomlin acknowledged. "They bring more than their presence and their playmaking. They instill confidence in those around them. That is a very real thing. You can't necessarily measure it. But as somebody who has been in this business, I acknowledge that it is real."

Let's get to it:
LAYNE PENROD FROM RIVERDALE, CA: Knowing the high standards the Steelers organization has for its players, can you enlighten me with some of the higher profile players who were basically let go or traded just because of their poor work ethic and/or attitude in general? I for one appreciate the fact that the Steelers take a no-nonsense approach when dealing with prima donna players. ANSWER: As is the case with any team's history, there are examples of the Steelers tolerating some players and actions and also moving on and cutting ties with some players. Sometimes a guy could start in one category and end up in the other. But I choose not to try to compile a list of players who might fall into this category, because oftentimes there's just an assumption about why a move might have been made. One apparent exception has to do with the 1970 trade of receiver Roy Jefferson to the Baltimore Colts, because that was reported by more than one outlet, and there were specifics about the objectional conduct.
A second-round pick (18th overall) in the 1965 NFL Draft from Utah, Jefferson played 5 season for the Steelers, during which he appeared in 65 regular season games, 56 of which were starts, and he had 199 catches for 3,671 yards (18.4 average) and 29 touchdowns. He was voted first-team All-Pro once and to two Pro Bowls, but following the 1969 season Jefferson began to test Coach Chuck Noll.
As reported in The Pittsburgh Press during training camp in 1970, "Jefferson's trade to the Colts was triggered by the veteran's attitude in training camp. The Utah graduate, who had expressed himself as dissatisfied with the settlement of the recent players' strike, had flouted the authority of Coach Chuck Noll on several occasions since reporting to camp. Noll's reaction was completely predictable … It became apparent two weeks ago that Jefferson and Noll were on a collision course in their player-coach relationship. Despite a Steelers rule that players wear helmets on the field, Jefferson showed up for at least two practices bare-headed. On several occasions he parked his personal car in an area banned to players' and coaches' vehicles."
In the Aug. 20, 1970, edition of The New York Times, William Wallace wrote: "Roy Jefferson, one of the best pass receivers in football, was traded by the Pittsburgh Steelers yesterday to the Baltimore Colts for Willie Richardson and a high future draft choice. Richardson also is a wide receiver … The coaches, Chuck Noll of the Steelers and Don McCafferty of the Colts thus exchanged brilliant players who had become problems. Richardson, 30 years old, had become so indifferent and casual about football that John Unitas, the quarterback, seldom sent a pass his way and Roy Perkins was promoted over him … Jefferson, 26, had irked Noll in little ways. He was sent home from Montreal before a preseason game against the Giants last summer after he had stayed out past the curfew hour … In training camp this summer he came to practice without a helmet and parked his car in a forbidden area. As the Steelers player representative, he also had expressed displeasure in the outcome of the recent players strike."
CHRIS BALMER FROM ALLENTOWN, PA: What has been the most significant difference in DeMarvin Leal's play on the defensive line this year that has people perking up? Is he in better shape, more acclimated to the role, or what? ANSWER: There are a lot of differences in DeMarvin Leal in this, August of his third professional season, and I believe all of those differences can be traced to this: When Leal entered the NFL as a third-year junior from Texas A&M, he was 21 years old. This will be his third complete lap around the NFL, from offseason program to training camp to preseason games to the regular season. He has matured as a person and as a professional. Leal can see a path to a future in the NFL, and now he has a better idea of how to go about attaining that.
CHRIS CROSBY FROM SEATTLE, WA: I am tired of all the wide receiver trade rumors. Do you think the Steelers depth chart at that position warrant so much concern? ANSWER: I also am tired of all the wide receiver trade rumors, too, and how that unit performs once the regular season starts will tell all of us whether "much concern" was warranted.
JOHN PUHALA FROM SPRINGFIELD, VA: After watching the first two preseason games, fans need to understand what preseason is truly for. Evaluation. As a local high school football coach, our team is going through the same process. Through the first two preseason games, though, is Payton Wilson the steal of this year's draft? ANSWER: I don't have any in-depth understanding of how all of the players selected during the 2024 NFL Draft are faring in their rookie training camps, and so I cannot even attempt an answer to your question. But I do believe Payton Wilson has shown some of the skills and mind-set and understanding of a quality NFL inside linebacker, and we'll just have to see where that takes him over the next few years.
RICH HUGHES FROM CONNEAUTVILLE, PA: What kind of money do players gets when they are released with injury settlements? ANSWER: Injury settlements are negotiated by the player's representative and the team, and the amount usually depends upon factors such as the player's contract and the estimated length of recovery from the injury. Those are a couple of the guidelines, and then as I mentioned it becomes a negotiation.
NICHOLAS MOSES FROM SIMI VALLEY, CA: Did Payton Wilson get concussed in the Bills game? I know he was being evaluated for a concussion, but I never heard if he actually sustained one. ANSWER: The NFL's rules for reporting injuries are different in the preseason than they are in the regular season. During the game vs. Buffalo, an announcement was made that Payton Wilson was being evaluated for a concussion because that removed him from participation. But no follow-up announcement is required during the preseason, and so there wasn't one.
PATRICK BRIGHT FROM SAN RAFAEL, MENDOZA, ARGENTINA: Based on the Steelers quarterback play thus far, would you agree it was a huge mistake to not re-sign Mason Rudolph? And two, if you reply mockingly to me, will you then post an apology after Mason leads his team far into the playoffs and the Steelers don't reach .500? ANSWER: Two-part answer:
1. No 2. Here's the reality of the Mason Rudolph situation: It was just not going to work out for him with the Steelers in terms of being a starting quarterback. I honestly cannot tell you what went wrong for Rudolph, but whatever it was it was seen as a deal-breaker. There just wasn't going to be a long-term relationship. Rudolph had been allowed to test unrestricted free agency in March 2023, but he got no offers, or at least none that he liked, and he resigned with the Steelers in May for one year at $1.35 million. Whatever the Steelers didn't like about Rudolph must have been what the rest of the league saw as well. To the many who carry the torch for Mason Rudolph, my advice would be to let it go. Rudolph currently is winning the job to be the backup to Will Levis in Tennessee, and I hope he makes it. I hope he can put together a nice career. Throughout Steelers history, I will acknowledge there is a list of quarterbacks the team has had and then traded/released who went on to greatness, but I don't know that Rudolph belongs on that list just yet.
DAVE CLARK FROM TOANO, VA: How was the decision to cap a squad at 53, and has there been discussion to increase the number? ANSWER: Roster size is something that is collectively bargained between the NFL and the NFLPA. The outcome of that Collective Bargaining Agreement was how rosters came to be limited to 53, and if there was going to be a change, that would be the process again.
RONNIE SHAW FROM LOGANVILLE, GA: With the new kickoff rule. How can teams do an onside kick. ANSWER: Onside kicks are still permitted, but only in the fourth quarter of games. Here are the rest of the new rules pertaining to onside kicks: • Trailing team must declare onside kick attempt to officials. • If the attempt goes past setup zone (defined as the area between the receiving team's 30-35-yard lines) untouched, the kicking team is assessed 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, and receiving team gets the ball at the kicking team's 20-yard line. • Outside of those changes, the previous years' rules for onside kicks apply.

Opponents on Steelers
Seahawks are talking about Porter, Watt and Tomlin
Steelers.com
The Steelers take on the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, a battle of two 8-7 teams who are fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.
Mason Rudolph is expected to start for the black and gold, a player Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll said he is familiar with.
"He's started a number of games," said Carroll. "We've got all kinds of film on him, so we can see him."
The Seahawks weighed in on Rudolph, rookie Joey Porter Jr., linebacker T.J. Watt and cornerback Patrick Peterson.
* * *
Coach Pete Carroll on quarterback Mason Rudolph: "He's been around for a few years. He's started a number of games. We've got all kinds of film on him, so we can see him. Big strong armed, good-looking kid. Looked great the other night, dropped some dimes on them, and made some huge plays, and gave them a real spark where they jumped to 21 to zip right off the bat. It's obvious that he lifted them. They got great play out of other guys too, turnovers and all of that helped, but he was right in the middle of all of that."
Linebacker Bobby Wagner on how to limit the explosive plays by the Steelers offense, including Najee Harris: "I think on some of those plays he just got behind the corner, or things like that. That is the first thing, not letting the guy get behind you. I think two, just understanding they have a good run game, they are going to mix it up really well. Doing your job. Every player has a job to do, and I think it's that simple. I don't think we have to load the box or anything. It's just making sure you do your assignment."
Quarterback Geno Smith on what stands out about the Steelers defense: "It starts with T.J. Watt, 17 sacks. One of the better defensive players in the league. Great edge guy, a guy who has it all. He has the bull rush. He's got quicks on the edge. He's really good at punching the ball out, causing havoc, getting turnovers for them, and also great at batting balls at the line of scrimmage. Just being mindful of where he is at all times, knowing that we have to have a plan for him, and being able to make sure that he isn't impacting the game the way that he has, and then overall, a Mike Tomlin coached team. A defense that plays hard, that gives you multiple looks. They're going to go out there, they're going to fight, they're going to compete. They lead the league in turnover differential, they're plus 10 right now, and they get a lot of turnovers. You can see they're in a lot of close games, they figure out ways to win at the end, they keep believing and keep fighting, very similar to how we are, and we're built. A great defense, a lot of good players on that side, some young players, but another challenge. They've got (Alex) Highsmith on the other side, he's got seven sacks, and he's got two interceptions and a couple of forced fumbles. There's a couple of guys on that side we have to be very mindful of."
Carroll on Patrick Peterson making the transition from corner to safety: "I don't know if I've ever said this to you guys, but when Patrick came to our camp at USC, I had made the comment that he was the best player at his position we had ever seen in all of those years we were there. He was so perfectly gifted. We obviously tried to get him to come. We couldn't get him. I've been watching him for a long time. He's an unbelievably gifted athlete, but it's way more than that. It's all the sense and the awareness. He's using all of that to make this quick transition. He looks smooth back there and he's comfortable doing it. This is what happens sometimes to corners, in their later years they get a chance to do this. He's totally capable of pulling this off. He's doing a nice job so far."
Receiver DK Metcalf on Joey Porter Jr. and what similarities he sees from guys that grew up around the locker room: "I think they just carry themselves differently and they are a lot smarter than their age. He is a very smart corner. For him just being a rookie, he has made a lot of plays. He has taken on a lot of big receivers. It's going to be a fun matchup going against him, knowing his dad was a heck of a football player for that same organization. I think it's going to be a good matchup."
Smith on Peterson and Porter: "I feel like I've been playing Pat my entire life, since high school. To see him transition into safety, he's always been an athlete, he's always been able to play all the positions, and I don't think that's no different. I think he's always going to be an impact player, that's just the type of guy he is and the type of ability he has.
"A rookie corner (Porter), but he's out there, he's playing like a vet. He's got a lot of confidence. A taller, more slender guy, long arms, seems like he does well in and out of breaks. Another guy that we've got to be on top of and make sure that when we're going at him, we're placing the ball in the right places. They've got a lot of talented guys on that defense and on that team. They're fighting for their season, so we expect them to come in and be prepared."
Carroll on containing T.J. Watt: "You have to do a little bit of everything. There's no one way to stop him. He's such a volatile football player and it's just really challenging. That's why he's got 17 sacks, and he's doing it again. He's having another great year. Everybody knows he's there. He's not hiding, so we have to do a nice job and keep him guessing a little bit the best we can and try to keep him from being a big part of this game."
Carroll on what makes Watt different than other elite pass rushers: "All of those guys have their own physical, unique makeup. All of those guys are different, but they all have the same kind of impact. Micah (Parsons) is a little different in how they use him, but they're extraordinarily gifted in what it takes to be a pass rusher. That's length, quickness, explosion, athleticism, sense and timing and feel, all of those things to be that high of a caliber player. It's not just how fast you are, how big you are, there's so many other things going. To sustain over years and continue to be a really impacting player, that's a whole different level of guy. Those guys you mentioned, they're way out there. They're all very exceptionally gifted with their physique and their physical side and what they have to offer, or they wouldn't be able to do it. It takes all of that."
Offensive coordinator Shane Waldon on what type if challenge Watt presents: "T.J. Watt, down in down out, is relentless on the edge there. Going against him two years ago, he was able to create turnovers. And his ability to create turnovers, obviously 17 sacks on the year, that goes without saying. But the creating the turnovers, the batted balls, the pursuit in the run game, he really is able to do it all. He's one of those players that plays at an elite level. Like some of the other guys we've had to go against, you have to be careful about knowing, understanding, and respecting him but knowing they also have 10 other guys on the field that are playing at a high level. So you can't take all your focus to one player and then you have all these other good players that can come to life at any given down."
Receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba on the Steelers defense: "I know historically great defense. They get after it. Their coaching staff over there, they're hungry. They get after the ball. They poke the ball out. They just play really hard. Since I have watched them as a kid, they have played really hard, and that defense has been historic. Excited to play those guys and excited to get after it."
Defensive end Leonard Williams on what he has seen from Mason Rudolph and the efficiency of the Steelers offense: "He definitely stood out. He led their offense pretty well and they scored a lot of points. They're coming off of a high right now, they have a lot of momentum going into this game. They're a good team and they're no slouch and we should definitely not overlook them, that's every week in this league though. I think it's definitely going to be a test to our defense to slow down their offense and put our offense on the field."
Carroll on what is true about a Mike Tomlin coached team: "That's a good question because it's so obvious. They play tough, they're aggressive, they don't settle for just lining up and giving it to you, you just have to beat them. They're going to come after you, they're going to attack you. They're always challenging with the defensive game plans, big backs run the football, the whole thing. Special teams is really good, they've blocked three punts this year already or something, so they've had a big factor in how they play and a fantastic turnover team. Again, he's always done that, and he did it again."
Carroll on what stands out about Tomlin: "His consistency is what's most noticeable to me, and something that I really appreciate, but he's also a really standup, up front dude. He's been always at the point of the discussions, whether he's working with the rules committee or whatever. He's had an opportunity to express what he feels and what he thinks is necessary, and it just screams who he is. He's a really good man. They've had the good fortune of having him for years; 16 years and never had a losing season. That's a pretty good mark, that's hard to get that done. I have the ultimate respect for him."
Wagner on Tomlin being complimentary of him this week: "To have someone like that have that respect for your game it's definitely great. I have watched him for a long time. I admire how he coaches. I admire the messages and how he cares about his guys. It's mutual respect for sure."

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Nov. 19

Let's get to it:
DAVID ROONEY FROM MARION, IA: I apologize for my question last week about Joey Porter Jr. Public humiliation accepted. ANSWER: No apology necessary. It is important to understand that young players are still learning their craft and are prone to mistakes as that process continues. Joey Porter Jr. is going to be a very good player for the Steelers for a long time. Be patient with him and enjoy the ride.
KURT CARMEL FROM BALTIMORE, MD: I'm not getting the obsession with seeing a "package" for Justin Fields. He is serviceable and arguably part of a massive upgrade to the 2023 depth chart at quarterback. But Fields said it himself – if he had played better, we wouldn't be talking about him as a backup. Could he start in the NFL? Probably. Can he beat out a 9-time Pro Bowl Super Bowl winning quarterback? Evidently he could not. So why is he any different than any other player who lost the starting job? I don't see other teams or pundits hollering for any other team to put together a package for their backup quarterback. Why should the Steelers? ANSWER: I'm not in the "obsessive" camp when it comes to finding ways to take advantage of Justin Fields' skill-set, but I also believe the Steelers shouldn't squander what he might be able to do for an offense that is not yet prolific. Getting Fields into games should be done thoughtfully and in proper doses, but he is a hard-worker and a teammate, and so there's nothing to lose by allowing him to contribute and feel a part of what the team is trying to achieve in 2024. Fields already has stepped up and made contributions as the scout team quarterback to help prepare the defense for players such as Jayden Daniels and Lamar Jackson, and so I'm in favor – again if done thoughtfully and in doses. And since Fields has shown himself to be extremely coachable, I would remind him that in a 2-point game when running for a first down to maintain possession of the ball it's most important you don't slide until you know absolutely that you're past the line to gain.
MATTHEW BERGER FROM COLUMBUS, OH: Did the Steelers make a mistake in not exercising Najee Harris' fifth-year option in the offseason? Seems like his price tag has gone way up since he is having a strong year, and he is a leader in the locker room. Do you see them working out a long-term deal with Najee? ANSWER: One of the elements of this that I believe is significant but rarely considered by fans is the track the NFL running back market is going to take? Is the trend of teams showing a reluctance to extend big-money second contracts to running backs going to continue, or might the pendulum start to swing back the other way? What will the market value of running backs be in March 2025?
PAT FLYNN FROM OAKDALE, PA: Can you give a list of the best authors/books written about the Steelers organization and history? What is on your "must read" list? ANSWER: There is a lot out there on this subject, but here are a few that I enjoyed:
• "Polamalu: The Inspirational Story of Pittsburgh Steelers Strong Safety Troy Polamalu" by Jim Wexell. Also, Wexell's "Pittsburgh Steelers: An Illustrated Timeline" looks to be something that would be a nice gift, because it's made up of brief nuggets with a lot of photos in a coffee-table style format • "Chuck Noll: His Life's Work by Michael MacCambridge • "Dan Rooney: My 75 Years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL" by Dan Rooney • "Myron Cope: Double Yoi!" by Myron Cope • "Legendary: The 2008 Pittsburgh Steelers Defense, The Zone Blitz, and My Six Decades in the NFL" by Dick LeBeau • "Their Life's Work: The Brotherhood of the 1970s Steelers" by Gary M. Pomerantz
An additional bit of information: MacCambridge's book on Noll; LeBeau's book on the 2008 Steelers; and both of Wexell's books are available on shop.steelers.com.
ISRAEL PICKHOLTZ FROM ASHKELON, ISRAEL: Why is Minkah Fitzpatrick part of the victory formation? ANSWER: As a last line of defense vs. an unlikely disaster. If there would be any issue with ball security that would end up with a player on defense in possession of the ball, Minkah Fitzpatrick is the one who could best locate that player and get him on the ground.
PAUL SOMERVILLE FROM HAMILTON, ONTARIO, CANADA: During the Ravens game, I didn't notice Mike Williams get too many snaps on offense. Usually, how long does it take a player to get used to an offensive system, or is Mike Williams not as good as the other players at that position? ANSWER: Steelers vs. Ravens on Sunday just didn't turn out to be a wide receiver kind of game. George Pickens played 69 offensive snaps (88 percent) to lead all Steelers WRs. Van Jefferson was next with 43 snaps (55 percent), then Calvin Austin III with 26 snaps (33 percent), and Mike Williams with 25 snaps (32 percent). Williams' snap count was not appreciably less than anyone's not named Pickens. Also, Pickens was targeted the most of any Steelers eligible receiver with 12, and then no other WR had more than 1 target. Williams had none. So, I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.
CRYSTAL JAMES FROM WAPPINGERS FALLS, NY: Was Mike Williams active for the game today? I was hoping to see him open the game up more for Pickens or himself, but I did not see him much. Did he play any snaps? ANSWER: See the above answer for Mike Williams' snaps and the relation to other players at his position. But I think you're getting way ahead of yourself – or allowing the hype to influence your perspective – based on 1 catch for 32 yards and a touchdown against Washington. Expecting him to be a focal point of the offense or an instant weapon/decoy is just not realistic.
ERIC CIMINI FROM TAMPA, FL: Let's say an offense commits a penalty on third-and-short and on the play the offense doesn't gain enough for the first down. The opposing coach declines the penalty to make it fourth-and-short. If the coach of the team that was on offense surprisingly decides to go for it on this fourth down, can the opposing coach change his decision and accept the penalty? ANSWER: The procedure is that the on-field referee will consult with the "opposing coach" about the penalty, explain the options involved in accepting or declining the penalty, and then ask for his decision. Once that decision is given to the on-field referee, that's the end of it. No backsies.
THOMAS WARD FROM LADSON, SC: Would it be out of the question to go ahead and get the team to vote for Chris Boswell as Steelers MVP for 2024? ANSWER: Far be it from me to stand in the way of a campaign.
CHRISTOPHER GIBSON FROM MANALAPAN, NJ: If a two-point conversion attempt ends with a sack, does the sacking player get credit for it? ANSWER: The only statistics awarded as part of a two-point conversion attempt are for points scored to the player who scores. No rushing yardage, no passing yardage, no tackles, no sacks, no interceptions, no fumble recoveries. Just the points.
AVRY BEN-DOV FROM SCRANTON, PA: This may be my nervous side talking, but do we ever win "normal" games? I feel like are always hanging on by a thread, even in games that we play well in. It seems like our games always come down to a play in the fourth quarter. ANSWER: That's just the way the NFL wants it, and not just for Steelers game but for all games. Building suspense over a couple hours to a dramatic conclusion at the end makes for good television, and the NFL is in the business of TV ratings and all of the things that come along with lucrative broadcasting arrangements with a variety of different entities kicking money into the pot. This I can tell you: Mike Tomlin became the Steelers coach in 2007, and since then no team has played in more one-score games than the Steelers and no team has won more one-score games than the Steelers.

Asked and Answered: Sept. 22
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
KURT BREITINGER FROM AUGUSTA, GA: In the short season so far it appears that the new kickoff rules have made kickoffs very boring. The Steelers in Atlanta kicked into the "target zone" a couple times with the ball being returned to about the 29-yard line. After that, it looked like we might as well just kick it out of the end zone to place the ball at the 30-yard line for a touchback. Do you think the new rules will survive past the current season? ANSWER: Too early to predict at this point, because in September the weather conditions are favorable to kickers, and most teams' placekickers are well-rested and healthy because teams do not overuse them during training camp and the preseason. A better test of the new kickoff rules will come once the weather gets colder and placekickers' legs aren't as fresh. Let's see what happens through November and December. And my knee-jerk reaction at this point is that I believe ownership is more interested in safety than excitement when it comes to kickoffs.
CHAD BILLEC FROM TAYLORS, SC: Is it still "illegal" to remove your helmet on the field of play? It happened during both games this season by our opponents. Week 2 after the unnecessary roughness hit, late in the game. Week 1 it happened after the Steelers were stopped on fourth down in the red zone. Is this something that went away when the league embraced team celebration? ANSWER: It is still a penalty for a player to remove his helmet on the field for a celebration/demonstration, or during a discussion/confrontation with an official over a call on the field.
TOM BRUZDA FROM WILDOMAR, CA: Since you determine the Steelers Digest Player of the Week, then I believe you're the best person to ask. Does it go anywhere after the naming? Is there a trophy, plaque, certificate, what? Does the player get something? ANSWER: It's just another piece of content that's short, easily digestible (get it?) and can be posted rather quickly on Steelers.com following the game.
JOE ASHER FROM TAMPA, FL: Big game this Sunday against Coach Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers. What is Coach Mike Tomlin's record against the Harbaugh brothers? ANSWER: Coach Mike Tomlin's record against the Ravens during John Harbaugh's tenure there – 2008-present – is 20-15, which includes the playoffs. His record against Jim Harbaugh, whose previous NFL coaching job was with the San Francisco 49ers from 2011-14 is 0-1.
ERIK SELESKY FROM CLEVELAND, OH: My father and I were discussing the "tush push" and other plays where the ball carrier was being assisted by other members of the offense. At one point, wasn't it illegal to do so? ANSWER: Yes. Assisting the runner by pushing, pulling, or carrying an offensive player who was in possession of the football once was a penalty. About 20 years ago, the NFL changed the rule where pushing the runner no longer was a penalty but pulling or carrying the runner was.
ELLEN CAUDLE FROM CHATTANOOGA, TN: What does Mark Schlereth have against the Pittsburgh Steelers? He told Steelers fans not to pat themselves on the back for beating the Broncos, but if the Broncos had beaten the Steelers by the same score he would be patting the Broncos fans on the back. ANSWER: To use a line made famous by Chuck Noll: Mark, who?
MATTHIAS ELFGEN FROM OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA: As always, a pleasure reading your thoughts and insights. Since Justin Fields is seeing more playing time than maybe expected, how is his snap percentage counter monitored during the season? If I understand correctly, if he plays 65 percent of all snaps we are due a fourth-round pick? Thanks for shedding some light on this. ANSWER: Playing time in each game is tabulated after every game by the NFL, and each player's percentage comes from the number of snaps he is on the field compared to the total number of snaps in the game for his team's offense, defense, and special teams. To use the first two games of the season as examples, the total number of the Steelers' offensive snaps was 68 in Atlanta and it was 66 in Denver. Come the end of the season, you would take the number of offensive snaps Fields played and divide it by the total number of offensive snaps during the season to get his play-time percentage.
And your understanding of the terms of the trade with the Bears for Fields is incorrect. In exchange for Fields, the Steelers will send the Bears a sixth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, but if Fields plays 51 percent of the snaps in 2024 that pick to the Bears becomes a fourth-round pick.
TOM HENSON FROM MARTINSVILLE, IN: As I understand it, Chicago will receive a seventh-round pick or a fourth-round pick for Justin Fields depending on whether he plays 51 percent of the offensive snaps. Do you think this will be considered at all in the starting quarterback decision, and if so would General Manager Omar Kahn have any input? ANSWER: As I explained in the previous answer, the terms of the Justin Fields trade is a sixth-round pick that becomes a fourth-round pick if he plays in 51 percent of the offensive snaps. Coach Mike Tomlin chooses the guys who start and/or see playing time in games, and his motivation is to win as many games as possible. I can guarantee you there would be no thought given to the difference between a fourth-round pick and a sixth-round pick if it's decided that the Steelers' best chance of winning would come with Fields as the starting quarterback. And that would include General Manager Omar Khan and President Art Rooney II.
PAUL PEACHEY FROM PARADISE, PA: The Steelers defense has only allowed 16 points across the first two weeks. As an average football fan, it's hard to tell whether the Atlanta and Denver offenses just had bad weeks, or is our defense playing at an elite level? ANSWER: In the case of the Broncos, I believe that's a bad team and the situation is made somewhat worse by starting a rookie QB (Bo Nix) who was a first-round pick but was the sixth quarterback to come off the board, which indicates to me that Coach Sean Payton was reaching with both hands there. Atlanta though is a different story. Last Monday night in Philadelphia, Kirk Cousins had a better game statistically than Jalen Hurts; he drove the Falcons 70 yards in 6 plays in 65 seconds for the game-winning touchdown that came on his 7-yard pass to WR Drake London. In that game the Falcons rushed for 152 yards, averaged 5.4 per attempt, and finished with 385 total yards to the Eagles' 365 total yards. It wouldn't surprise me to see the Falcons compete for the AFC South Division title and a/or a playoff spot in the NFC when it's all said and done. In conclusion, allow me to quote the late-great Tunch Ilkin, who always said, "If you can't beat the stiffs, then you are one."
GLENN McCULLOUGH FROM PITTSBURGH, PA: Watching 6-foot-7 Darnell Washington tower over the average 5-11 defensive backs and making an excellent catch, I'm wondering if he might be utilized more as a receiver than a blocker? ANSWER: In my opinion, what Darnell Washington showed in making a nifty back-shoulder catch for a touchdown in Denver is that he can be a contributor to the passing game. But as a blocker, Washington can have an impact. That's not an insignificant difference.
SCOTT SHILEY FROM BRICK, NJ: Would you please explain the injured reserve list rules for 2024? It's my understanding that a player placed on IR before the regular season must be out for the season. What is the difference between the regular IR list and the IR/designated for return list? Does this mean that any player on the regular IR cannot return after 4 games? What is the season limit on players who can return from IR for 2024? ANSWER: I found this July 23 story by the Associated Press as being one that offers a pretty clear and complete explanation of the rules for the injured reserve list in 2024:
"Players are put on the reserve/injured list — more commonly referred to as IR — when they have a football-related injury and need to miss at least a few weeks. Players on IR don't count against the active roster, but their salaries count against the cap.
"If a player is placed on this list before the regular season begins, he could miss the entire season unless — per a rules adjustment this year — they are designated to return during the roster cutdown to 53 players after training camp. Teams can designate up to two such players to return.
"Players on IR need to miss a minimum of four games. NFL teams can designate up to eight players to return from IR during the regular season (and up to 10 if they make the postseason) and an individual player can be so designated twice.
"Players designated for return from IR before the season count against a team's eight- or 10-player limit.
"When a player is cleared to practice, a 21-day window begins and the player must be activated to the 53-man roster or be placed on season-ending injured reserve at the conclusion of that three-week period. They could also be released or traded."
MIKE SMITH FROM ALTOONA, PA: In Denver, Cam Heyward had a little wrestler or something as a patch on his uniform. What was that, and what was it for? ANSWER: That patch was a replica of the trophy awarded to the Walter Payton Man of the Year, which Cam Heyward won in 2023. And yes, Russell Wilson had the same patch on his jersey because he won the award in 2020.

Opponents on Steelers
Bears are talking about Diontae, Ben, T.J. and more
Steelers.com
The Steelers will take on the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football from Heinz Field, a primetime game that has the Steelers looking to continue their winning streak, while the Bears are looking to break a losing streak.
The Steelers have won their last three games to improve their record to 4-3, while the Bears have dropped their last three games, with a 3-5 record on the season.
Bears Coach Matt Nagy talked about his team trying to turn things around, pointing to how the Steelers have done it.
"Look at the Steelers for example," said Nagy. "They started out 1-3 and here they are 4-3, they won three in a row. They fought through it. They probably have pretty good leaders. They probably have guys that care about playing. They don't point fingers. They don't blame. They are not negative. They are positive."
Nagy and the Bears weighed in on other topics regarding the Steelers, including Ben Roethlisberger, T.J. Watt, Diontae Johnson and more.
* * *
Quarterback Justin Fields on what stands out about the Steelers defense: "They have a great front seven. They've been running that defensive scheme for a long time now. They all know it. They are all very experienced in it. They have a lot of great athletes. Great guys on the edge, great guys at three-technique. Great linebackers. It's going to be a challenge for us."
Coach Matt Nagy on Coach Mike Tomlin: "I think the way that he leads his organization is rare. I've been to different owner's meetings over the years and have been around him. He went to William and Mary, I went to Delaware, but I was younger. But the path he came through, the way he has done things, I really respect him. He is real with his coaches. He is real with his players. He is authentic. He is tough on them, but he loves them. And he wins. That is what he does, he wins.
"I just have a ton of respect for him. One of the greatest coaches to ever coach in this league. I have a ton of respect."
Nagy on if he and Tomlin talk at the owner's meeting: "We'll talk every now and then. Nothing too crazy or real personal. More than anything it's a respect factor I have. I like his style. Every head coach has a certain style, I think his style is really good. I like the way he coaches."
Defensive back Tashaun Gipson Sr. on the obstacles the Steelers offense presents: "It affects your pass rush because Ben Roethlisberger can get the ball out really fast. He doesn't want to get hit. He took a lot of hits in his days. He's not the same old Ben Roethlisberger that's shaking guys off like he used to. It used to be crazy. I used to be in Cleveland and seeing three guys had to take him down. Obviously, he doesn't want to get hit anymore. And it shows. Their plays are designed to get the ball out quick. He's taking shots when needed. Not many vertical passes that he's willing to take.
"He's that quarterback that's going to take what you give him. That's always dangerous. Not many quarterbacks would want to take five-yard checkdowns all the way down the field. There are a few select quarterbacks and most of them are Hall of Famers, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers. You give them five, they'll take five. He fits in that category. You have to play tighter."
Cornerback Jaylon Johnson on Roethlisberger: "I feel like he has been playing consistent the last couple of years. He is getting the ball out quick. That has been his thing as he has gotten older, get the ball out quick and make his reads. He has a few playmakers at the wide receiver spot and even gaining Najee Harris out of the backfield and running the ball. He definitely has the ability to get the ball out quick to his playmakers and allow them to make the plays."
Nagy on linebacker T.J. Watt: "He's a game-changer. He's special. He's all over the place. He's smart. He can beat you with different moves. Speed to power. He can bullrush you. He'll be all over the place, different spots on the d-line.
"He goes after the football. When he tackles, he tackles the football. When you're in the pocket, you better have ball security because he's going after that football. You look at the Seattle game in overtime, you look at several games throughout the year. There's a reason why they took care of him. You talk to guys like (former Steelers tight end) Jesse (James) who have been there and you get feedback on who some of these guys are, and how they work, and he is a hard worker that cares."
Gipson Sr. on Diontae Johnson: "He's a good football player. He's savvy in his routes. He's smooth. I know he had a couple of cases of the dropsies, but he's been catching the ball efficiently. He can run every route efficiently. He is a vertical threat. He can stretch the top. Our cornerbacks will have their hands full.
"I have seen his game grow from last year to this year. He is growing into a good football player. I can see why Ben trusts him because his routes are designed…some of the routes he runs are pretty crazy and Ben Roethlisberger knows where to find him. Obviously losing No. 19 (JuJu Smith-Schuster) hurts and somebody needed to step up and I think No. 18 (Johnson) is doing that right now. In my opinion I think he is their best receiver. He is going to get his targets."

Steelers fall to Bengals, 24-10
Steelers.com
Another attempt at a fourth-quarter rally came up short and the Steelers were beaten by the Bengals, 24-10, this afternoon at Heinz Field.
The Steelers' last gasp at a comeback fizzled when quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hit running back Najee Harris for a loss of 1 on fourth-and-10 from the Bengals' 11-yard line and the Bengals took over with 3:02 left in the fourth quarter.
The Steelers final possession ended when Harris dropped a pass from Roethlisberger on fourth-and-2 from the Steelers' 35-yard line with 1:23 left in the game.
The Steelers dropped their second consecutive home game after opening the season with a 23-16 win at Buffalo and fell to 1-2.
The Bengals improved to 2-1.
The Steelers' offensive frustrations throughout were exemplified by the fourth-quarter possession that turned the ball over on downs, and by the drive for a field goal that cut the Bengals lead to 24-10 with 8:09 left in the fourth.

Kicker Chris Boswell's 26-yard effort capped an 18-play, 88-yard march that used up 9:03 with the Steelers trailing by 17 and had established a first-and-goal at the Bengals' 3-yard line before retreating thanks in part to two penalties (offensive pass interference against wide receiver Chase Claypool and a false start against offensive tackle Dan Moore Jr.
Quarterback Joe Burrow's second touchdown pass to wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase and third scoring strike on the day, this one a 9-yard toss, and kicker Evan McPherson's extra point increased the Bengals lead to 24-7 with 6:18 left in the third quarter.
The Bengals needed just three plays and 1:33 to cover 19 yards after linebacker Logan Wilson's second interception of Roethlisberger.
The Steelers missed a chance to close to within 24-10 when Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal attempt (wide left) with 4:22 left in the third, Boswell's first miss of the season.
Cincinnati established a two-score advantage at 17-7 on a 43-yard field goal by McPherson with 8:47 left in the third.
The first possession of the second half covered 55 yards on 10 play in 6:13. The Bengals began the march with three consecutive plays that produced first downs (an 11-yard run by running back Joe Mixon, a 14-yard completion from Burrow to wide receiver Auden Tate and an 11-yard run by Mixon).
The Bengals took a seven-point lead into the locker room at halftime thanks to a quick counterpunch after the Steelers had tied the game at 7-7.
Cincinnati took the subsequent kickoff and drove 75 yards on three plays in 27 seconds, and covered the final 34 yards of the march on a long pass from Burrow to Chase, who got behind cornerback James Pierre. McPherson's extra point upped the Bengals' lead to 14-7 with 37 seconds left prior to halftime.
The Steelers tied the game at 7-7 on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to tight end Pat Freiermuth and Boswell's conversion with 1:04 remaining in the second quarter. Freiermuth's first career touchdown reception capped a 15-play, 86-yard drive in 8:32. The Steelers converted three third downs on the possession and produced splash plays of 16 yards (Roethlisberger to wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster), 20 yards (a carry by Harris) and 18 yards (a catch-and-run connection from Roethlisberger to Harris). The Steelers also overcame a holding penalty against guard Kevin Dotson on the way to the end zone.
The Bengals struck first on a 17-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to wide receiver Tyler Boyd.
The scoring drive covered 42 yards on six plays in 3:51 after the Bengals gained possession on an interception by Wilson, who caught a deflected ball after Roethlisberger had been hit on his delivery by defensive end Sam Hubbard.
Burrow found Boyd on a crossing route on third-and-2 from the Steelers' 17-yard line and Boyd bounced off of outside linebacker Melvin Ingram III at the 10 and sprinted into the end zone. McPherson's extra point made it Bengals 7, Steelers 0 with 2:54 left in the first quarter.
The Steelers committed four offensive penalties on their first three possessions, none of which produced a first down.
The third three-and-out ended a possession that began at the Steelers' 44 following the Steelers' first interception of the season (strong safety Terrell Edmunds collected the carom of a pass that had been tipped by free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick).
The Steelers played without outside linebacker T.J. Watt (groin), outside linebacker Alex Highsmith (groin) and wide receiver Diontae Johnson (knee).
Smith-Schuster (ribs) was unable to finish the game after catching three passes for 25 yards in the first two quarters. Smith-Schuster didn't return after the Steelers' first possession of the second half.
Offensive tackle Chukwuma Okorafor left late in the third quarter to be evaluated for a concussion.
Center Kendrick Green (knee) exited with 4:21 left in regulation.

Training Camp Report: Aug. 11
Steelers.com
LATROBE, Pa. – The Steelers didn't take the field until 3:55 p.m. on Sunday, in part as a response to their preseason opener being played less than 48 hours earlier. And as another response to their preseason opener, the script for the session reflected what happened during that 20-12 loss to the Houston Texans.
"Really an important day for us in the get-better (category) following a players' off day. We spent the morning analyzing our game tape from Friday and making necessary corrections and really plotting a course for this week so we can position ourselves to be better. We've got a lot of work ahead of us this week, but it's good to get back out here this afternoon for a corrections-like practice. I think it's always important at this stage of development that our physical labor matches our needs. Since we saw some things in the stadium that we didn't like, we catered a lot of the work that we did today to kind of address some of that. We'll continue to push forward through the week."
Keeping with the "physical labor matches our needs" theme, one of the early individual drills centered around catching punts. Calvin Austin III, Quez Watkins, John Rhys Plumlee, Scotty Miller, and Cam Sutton participated, with the exercise made a bit more difficult by having the guys field the punts while holding a tennis ball in each hand.
TOMLIN'S INJURY UPDATE "Troy (Fautanu) got a knee sprain (during the preseason game), and he'll be out this week. I'll just kind of leave it at that. We're really optimistic about a quick return from him, but we'll take it day by day. WR Tariq Black had a hamstring today and wasn't able to finish; CB Kalon Barnes had a quad today and wasn't able to finish. We minimized some guys today, like we do in the process to give them some rest, but more importantly than that, it's to provide opportunity and elevated opportunities for others. We lessened the workload of some of the top cornerbacks in the effort to see some of the other ones – Darius Rush for example, Cory Trice for another example, but that's just part of the process."
With Fautanu not practicing, the No. 2 offensive line was aligned as follows: (left to right) Dylan Cook, Mason McCormick, Zach Fraser, Ryan McCollum, and Spencer Anderson. The No. 1 offensive line continued to be aligned as follows: (left to right) Dan Moore Jr., Isaac Seumalo, Nate Herbig, James Daniels, and Broderick Jones.
When Tomlin was asked about Fautanu's performance during the preseason opener prior to the injury, he said, "He was doing really well. Obviously, we wanted to get him a lot of work, because that's where he is in development. But I like the general trajectory of it."
NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS • Quez Watkins made a few nice plays at receiver during the practice, including a diving catch deep down the left sideline on a pass thrown by Justin Fields. Watkins also made a tough catch at the goal line for a touchdown during the first repetition of the 2-minute period. "He needed a day today," said Tomlin.
• Another receiver who stood out at times was Scotty Miller, with a catch for the offense's only touchdown during 7-Shots, and a 21-yard catch during the second repetition of the 2-minute period.
Sunday's practice was in helmets only. Monday's practice is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. and is expected to be in pads.

PAUL BUREK FROM GAINESVILLE, GA: Do the Steelers still use exotic blitz packages? I have not heard/seen anything about that in some time. Wasn't it Dick LeBeau who created this type of defense? ANSWER: Yes, Dick LeBeau created and perfected the zone-blitz concepts that allowed a defense to pressure quarterbacks with blitzes without exposing itself in coverage by playing zone behind it. But in today's NFL, the key to good defense is the ability to generate pressure on the quarterback without having to blitz, by only rushing four. Quarterbacks now are protected in the pocket and allowed to get rid of the ball with less fear of intentional grounding, and the player safety initiative protects receivers as defenseless when the ball is in the air. Defensive backs are limited in the way they're allowed to use their bodies as a means to break up passes, and pass rushers are penalized if they land on the quarterback while sacking him. Add it all up, and pass defense has had to change from the era that marked the heyday of the zone-blitz. There still may be some zone-blitz concepts in the Steelers defensive packages, but it hasn't been the primary scheme for a long time.
SCOTT LENTZ FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: Do NFL teams have the opportunity to provide behind the scenes feedback about officiating crews? While there's no point in caving to the grumbling of fans and publicly complaining, it seems reasonable for teams to evaluate crews based on fairness, accuracy, etc. ANSWER: The NFL has its own method of reviewing and evaluating/grading the officiating as well as the individual officials within each crew. While teams can present questions and concerns to the league office about officiating, I sincerely doubt the NFL would have any interest in any kind of detailed critique coming from individual teams. But what teams are able to do on their own is study officiating crews in terms of which ones call a lot of pass interference penalties, or which referees are known to be very quarterback friendly when it comes to protecting them while they're in the pocket, etc. Doing it that way provides teams with information going into the game, rather than spending time complaining about things after the fact.
CARL ANDERSON FROM FREDERICKSBURG, VA: I know that there are a variety of reasons, but do you think a baseball-like (but with just one tier) minor league would work for the NFL? I believe there are enough big cities that would support a fall/winter league, making it economically feasible. Maybe Wednesday/Thursday nights? ANSWER: I disagree with the economically feasible aspect, because there have been a bunch of wannabe pro football leagues that haven't been successful, and from the NFL's perspective, why would it want to try to prop up a minor league when it has college football? In the fall/winter time slot you suggest, would you as a football fan rather watch Alabama-Georgia, or a couple of minor league teams made up of guys who didn't make NFL rosters? I just don't think there's room for another league, because even though I am involved in the football business, I can tell you I did not in the past nor do I watch in the present any of the UFL or XFL or any of those leagues when they were on television in the spring, or whenever. But every Saturday, I am interested in watching SEC football.
COREY BATES FROM BRANCHPORT, NY: Why do officials have numbers on their shirts? ANSWER: For identification purposes. Like players, there are names attached to those numbers. In a recent Asked and Answered, there was a question about flip cards, and this was my answer: "A game day flip card is double-sided and shows the rosters, starting lineups, depth charts, for both teams, plus the officiating crew, and other pertinent information. They are used in both NFL press boxes as well as at major college football games." The listing of the officiating crew on the flip card lists each individual by name, job assignment (referee, umpire, side judge, etc.), and by the number on the back of their shirts. It allows everybody to know who is who.
JASON PRASTER FROM SAN ANTONIO, TX: When a player on defense intercepts a pass, is that player also credited with a "pass defensed?" I was looking online to try and find an NFL Stats rulebook but no dice. I was curious if Cory Trice Jr. was credited with an INT and PD in the game against Denver. ANSWER: In the game against the Broncos, the on-site stats crew credited Cory Trice Jr. with an interception and a pass defensed for the play he made in the end zone. I don't know that there's a universal standard for on-site stats crews when it comes to whether an interception is automatically a pass defensed, or whether those are two distinct categories.
JEREMY RONSON FROM PENARTH, WALES: Genuine point of clarification rather than a criticism of officials: What was the difference between the holding penalty against Dan Moore in the Broncos game and the numerous times the Broncos offensive tackles were "hooking" both Alex Highsmith and T.J. Watt on their pass rushes without being flagged? ANSWER: I have no idea, and that's being totally honest. No sarcasm. No veiled shots at the officiating. One summer at Saint Vincent College some years ago I attended the presentation done by the NFL officials during their tour of training camps, and part of that presentation had to do with what was considered holding and what was not. After that session was over I had no better understanding of what constituted holding than I did before walking into that presentation. I have come to believe a lot of it is arbitrary.
MATT MARIS FROM PORTLAND, OR: It has annoyed me to hear fans describe Dan Moore as horrible because he has struggled against some elite pass rushers. They never mention how he has been a solid run blocker his entire career. He has been solid as a rock in both pass protection and run blocking. Can you please tell us how he is doing compared to other left tackles and your thoughts on his play this year? ANSWER: I am not knowledgeable enough about the intricacies of offensive line play to provide a critique of Dan Moore Jr.'s play and how that might compare to the performances of other left tackles around the league. But I have asked people who know what good offensive line play is, and they have told me that Moore never has been horrible even going back to the start of his rookie year, and that right now he is the best left tackle on the Steelers roster. The guy has started 51 of a possible 53 regular season games since he entered the NFL as a No. 4 pick (128th overall) in the 2021 NFL Draft from Texas A&M. Beginning with the 2021 season, he has played 3,327 offensive snaps, which worked out to 99 percent in 2021, 100 percent in 2022, 95 percent in 2023, and 100 percent through two games of 2024. If he was "horrible" the Steelers wouldn't be trotting him out there every Sunday.
KEN WALDROP FROM ONTONAGON, MI: How close are we to having Isaac Seumalo back in the lineup, and also do you think not having his experience in there hampers the play of young players like Broderick Jones? ANSWER: Isaac Seumalo was listed as a non-participant in Wednesday's practice, which indicates he isn't quite ready to return to the lineup on Sunday against the Chargers. Maybe he's able to get back on the practice field next week leading up to the game in Indianapolis. Talented, veteran guards are a help to the players on both sides of them along the offensive line, and for Seumalo those guys would be left tackle Dan Moore Jr. and center Zach Frazier. Clear communication of the pass-blocking calls and the execution of tandem blocks or double-team blocks require timing and teamwork, and Seumalo is a very good player.
ERIC ASH FROM WELLSVILLE, NY: Being 2-0 and on top the division is great, but only 31 points, one touchdown and 8 field goals (half of them from 40 yards out or more) in two games doesn't bode well for a long season. Does Russell Wilson take over as soon as he is healthy? ANSWER: The way I understood what Coach Mike Tomlin said at his news conference on Tuesday was that Justin Fields will start at quarterback until Russell Wilson is cleared medically. Once that happens and Wilson is able to return to full participation in practice, a decision then will be made on who starts at quarterback. Until then, Tomlin said he will not deal with hypotheticals, or as Bill Cowher used to call hypotheticals, "playing the what-if-game."
PATRICK CONOVER FROM HUNTSVILLE, AL: I have tried to watch every play on television for both games this season and it could be me not seeing the entire field, but have we attempted any passes over the middle deeper than a few yards? I thought we would have seen several attempts to Pat Freiermuth by now, but don't recall seeing even one. ANSWER: After the win in Atlanta, offensive coordinator Arthur Smith said he told Justin Fields to avoid throwing the ball down the middle of the field because of Falcons' free safety Jessie Bates, who had 20 career interceptions coming into the 2024 season, including 6 in 2023. Last Monday, Bates sealed Atlanta's win with an interception of a deep pass from Jalen Hurts with 27 seconds left, and so apparently that was a sound strategy by Smith. Smith's game plan is going to be a week-to-week proposition based on what the Steelers' offensive personnel is capable of executing as well as based on the relative strengths of that week's opposing defense. Making blanket statements or coming to conclusions after 2 weeks of a 17-game season is wasted energy.
PAUL PIMENTEL FROM FRESNO, CA: In David Carr's rookie season (2002), despite abysmal offensive stats, he earned a win against the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 24-6. Maybe the game's outcome was so woeful, you blocked it out of your memory. As a bonus, that was Houston's inaugural season. ANSWER: As a bonus (for me), here is the wording of the question from the Sept. 17 edition of Asked and Answered about the Steelers and rookie quarterbacks: "I read that the Steelers are 24-6 against rookie quarterbacks during the Mike Tomlin era. Who were the 6 we lost to?" As you were so smug to point out, the Steelers lost to the Houston Texans and rookie quarterback David Carr in 2002. Who was the Steelers coach in 2002? Was it Mike Tomlin? No, it was Bill Cowher. Back in grade school, I remember the nuns teaching us what they called "reading comprehension." Maybe you were absent the day they taught that at your grade school.

The Panthers are talking about QBs, Minkah and Cam
Steelers.com
The Steelers will face Carolina on Sunday at Bank of America Stadium, and one thing interim coach Steve Wilks knows is whoever lines up under center for the black and gold, they will be in control of the offense.
Rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett is in the concussion protocol, although he did practice in a limited fashion on Wednesday, and there is nothing definitive as to whether it will be him, Mitch Trubisky or Mason Rudolph on Sunday.
"When you look at their situation offensively, I know we're talking about the quarterback being in the protocol," said Wilks. "When you look at Rudolph as well as Trubisky, they both are more than capable of going out and executing and running this offense. I have had the pleasure of coaching against these guys on several occasions and I've gotten beaten by them.
"You look at their mindset and what they try and do offensively, a lot like ourselves. They try to establish the run game upfront. Try to move the pocket a little bit and take their shots downfield. Pretty good receivers in (Diontae) Johnson and (George) Pickens. I think as you saw last week Trubisky was able to get the ball deep and over the top sometimes.
"A lot of respect for all three of those guys and what they are able to do. If (Pickett) doesn't play, I'm sure, Rudolph or Trubisky will be able to run that offense effectively."
If it is Pickett, Wilks likes what he has seen from him so far in his rookie season.
"I think he has a strong arm," said Wilks. "He can make every throw. He makes good decisions being a young quarterback. I think he's done some good things early on."
It's not just the quarterback situation that is on Wilks mind, but also the Steelers defense, a defense he has a lot of respect for.
"They've got it on every level," said Wilks. "(Cameron) Heyward can take over the game at any time. Very dominant. All-Pro player. When you look at Myles Jack on one side and (T.J.) Watt on the other, they are very active in the things that they are doing, stopping the run and creating and getting pressure on the quarterback.
"Big fan of (Minkah) Fitzpatrick. Phenomenal player. The things that he can do on the back end, they move him around all over the place. Plays with great eyes, great anticipation for breaking on the football."
Quarterback Sam Darnold knows he is going to have to be on his toes, understanding pressure is going to be coming at him from the Steelers front seven.
"They've got really good players," said Darnold. "They have really good players up front, their front seven and the back end. They've got them everywhere. And they make plays. They've got great scheme. They've got great coaches over there as well.
"We know we've got to be prepared for a lot. They're really good in man coverage. They're really good in their zones too. Truly have to be prepared for everything. They do a really good job of mixing it up, disguising coverages, disguising pressures. We just got to do a really good job of communicating that."

Opponents on Steelers
Bengals are talking about the 'D', Ben & more
The Steelers are back in the 'kitchen' this week with an AFC North matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals at Heinz Field.
The Steelers, sitting at 8-0, are looking to remain undefeated, while the Bengals, 2-5-1, are looking for an upset.
Coach Zac Taylor knows the challenge the Bengals are facing this week, especially going against a formidable Steelers defense.
"What stands out is their experience on that side of the ball playing together," said Taylor. "You look at a lot of those guys that have been in the system for a really long time and have played next to each other. And that shows up on the tape. That's a lot of the reason why they're having so much success."
The Bengals talked more about the defense, Ben Roethlisberger, and more:
* * *
Coach Zac Taylor on the Steelers offense: "They're always an explosive offense. They've got good backs. Good, physical linemen. Ben is one of the best in the league. They are doing a really good job of using these tight ends and the receivers they've got. They're all playmakers. You see them all show up on these explosive plays when they are matched up one-on-one. They do a nice job with their route running and creating explosives. They all look smooth. They have good hands. They're certainly dangerous on offense."
Linebacker Josh Bynes on playing against the Steelers overall: "If you play the Steelers enough, you know what they bring to the table. You know that they just don't care who's lined up in front of them and they don't care what you are running, they don't care about whatever it is, we're going to run our thing and that's on you to stop it. When I was in Detroit, I had the privilege of going against the Steelers in training camp for a couple of days and being around Mike Tomlin, so I promise you his mentality is 'this is what it is. You either stop it or you don't.' And that's what it's going to be about this Sunday.
"Even when you watch the film, they have this mentality that we're going to come down and we're going to punch you in the mouth, we're going to do our plays and it's up to you to stop it. If you do, you do. If you don't, then it's going to be a long day for you. It isn't about nothing else. It isn't dodge, it isn't about trying to trick you this and try to do all that or whatever. It's just playing sound football, your fundamentals and your keys, and read your stuff and just come downhill and play some real football."
Safety Von Bell on Ben Roethlisberger: "He won the Super Bowl. He has experience, he's been in the playoffs, and he's seen a lot of great ball and a lot of ballplayers. That's what makes him, him. He's a competitor, and he's standing up there, you're not going to get much movement but he's going to take a hit and complete the pass and he'll keep on going.
"That's what the mentality that they have and that franchise is. Just bloody nose, punch you in the mouth and they're going to keep on going.
"What makes him Big Ben is that he's getting tackles by D-ends and D-tackles and he's completing the passes still. You've got to grab his arm. He's very strong. He's seen a lot, and you can't fool him in this league. He's got that timing, and Coach Tomlin really trusts him and knows what kind of player he is."
Taylor on the Steelers defense: "Their defense is one of the best in the league. It really starts up front with those front guys that they've got. They put a lot of pressure on the quarterback. They have played together for a long time. They have good backers behind them. Minkah (Fitzpatrick) leads that secondary and they have really good corners. It's a group we are familiar with. They play really well together. They have 34, 35 sacks. A ton of turnovers they have created. They do a really nice job on defense."
Taylor on if continuity on defense is an asset to the Steelers this year: "It appears that way. You don't see mistakes on tape. Some defenses they play, you can tell where there are miscommunication errors and flat out busts. You don't see that against these guys. They do a good job of playing all 11 guys together."
Quarterback Joe Burrow on Roethlisberger: "He's one of a handful that I always enjoyed watching. It feels like he is always in control of what's going on. It feels like he's never rushed, and he sees the field. I always enjoyed watching him growing up."
Bell on the Steelers offense: "They play as a unit. They trust the plan, they really feed off each other. Big plays, especially Claypool, JuJu, (James) Washington. (James) Conner is the work horse on the ground. Him and the group of backs, and the offensive line, they're huge. They buy time for Ben to make the right reads and the right throws, and they're just clicking on all cylinders right now."
Taylor on preparing for the Steelers without knowing Roethlisberger's status for sure: "They have a good quarterback room. You know Roethlisberger's going to play, barring something unforeseen. He's a tremendous quarterback. He's gotten so many reps over the course of his life. Can't imagine that he's going to be any different whether he's practicing this week or not. We've got to be ready for him. We played against Mason (Rudolph) last year as well. We've seen a lot of tape of him. And (Joshua) Dobbs. He's got a lot of tape in the NFL as well. We'll prepare for the Pittsburgh Steelers offense. We know it's going to be a tough test for us. They're a great unit. They have a lot of good skill players, a really veteran offensive line group."

Holcomb, Lee and Wilson return to practice
Steelers.com
Linebacker Cole Holcomb, defensive lineman Logan Lee and receiver Roman Wilson returned to practice today but remain on the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform List (Holcomb) and Reserve/Injured List (Lee and Wilson).
The Steelers have a 21-day window to either activate any of them to the 53-man roster, or they remain out for the the remainder of the year.
Holcomb suffered a season-ending knee injury last season against the Tennessee Titans. Holcomb had 54 tackles and two forced fumbles before he was injured.
The Steelers signed Holcomb as an unrestricted free agent before the 2023 season, after he spent four years with the Washington Commanders.
Lee was placed on the Reserve/Injured List before the start of the regular season.
Lee, one of the team's sixth-round draft picks, played college football at Iowa. He appeared in 43 games, starting 41 of them, and had 158 career tackles, including 58 solo stops, 18.5 tackles for a loss, nine sacks and seven passes defensed.
Wilson was placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Oct. 28. Wilson, one of the team's third-round picks in 2024, was selected with the 84th overall pick.
Wilson played college football at Michigan where he appeared in 46 career games, finishing his career with 107 receptions for 1,707 yards and 20 touchdowns. In 2023 he appeared in 15 games, finishing with career highs with 48 receptions for 789 yards and 12 touchdowns.

Steelers fall to Packers, 27-17
Steelers.com
Historic Lambeau Field turned into a venue in which recent history was repeated for the Steelers.
The offense started fast but was unable to dent the end zone again until just 4:04 remained in the game and the Steelers were beaten by the Packers, 27-17, in Green Bay, Wis.
The Steelers lost their third straight game and fell to 1-3.
The Packers won their third straight and improved to 3-1.
Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger went 26-for-40 passing for 232 yards with one touchdown and one interception.
Roethlisberger became the eighth player in NFL history to throw 400 career touchdown passes and passed Dan Marino ( 61,361) for sixth place on the NFL's all-time passing yards list (61,381).
Running back Najee Harris' 1-yard touchdown run and kicker Chris Boswell's extra point accounted for the final margin with 4:04 left in the fourth quarter.
The Steelers' defense held the Packers to a field goal on the first possession of the second half, when the Packers drove from their 25-yard line to the Steelers' 5. From there, running back Aaron Jones lost 3 yards, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was sacked by outside linebacker T.J. Watt for a loss of 3 and Rodgers threw incomplete into the end zone.
Kicker Mason Crosby's 29-yard field goal upped Green Bay's lead to 20-10 with 9:31 left in the third quarter.
The Packers were more efficient the next time opportunity knocked.
They moved 40 yards on four plays in 2:15 after a 20-yard punt had established possession at the Steelers' 40. Running back AJ Dillion burst for 25 yards to the Steelers' 1 and Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb just inside the pylon on a bootleg right. Crosby's extra point made it 27-10 Packers with 4:46 left in the third.
The Packers took a 17-10 lead into the locker room at halftime after a blocked 31-yard field goal attempt and return for a touchdown by free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick was nullified by an offside penalty against cornerback Joe Haden.

Crosby connected on a second attempt, this one from 26 yards away, and upped the Packers' advantage to seven with five seconds left in the second quarter. Green Bay's scoring drive covered 76 yards on 13 plays in 5:36.
The Packers took a 14-7 lead on a 23-yard catch-and-run touchdown by Cobb and a Crosby extra point with 10:55 left in the second.
Green Bay gained possession on a turnover created when defensive end Kingsley Keke knocked the ball from Roethlisberger's grasp and the fumble was recovered by nose tackle Kenny Clark at the Steelers' 23. The Packers overcame a 10-yard penalty for an illegal block on the first play of what became a four-play, 23-yard touchdown drive in 1:33.
The Steelers closed to within 14-10 on a 52-yard field goal by kicker Chris Boswell with 5:41 remaining prior to halftime. The 10-play, 41-yard drive in 5:14 might have resulted in a touchdown, but Roethlisberger over-threw wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster at the Green Bay 5 on first-and-10 from the Packers' 32.
The Steelers struck first on a free-play connection from Roethlisberger to wide receiver Diontae Johnson that went for a 45-yard touchdown. The Packers had jumped offside on third-and-4 from the Green Bay 45 and the Steelers took advantage by taking a shot deep. Boswell's extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead with 10:04 left in the first quarter.
The eight-play, 75-yard drive in 4:56 produced the Steelers' first first-quarter points and first first-possession points of the season.
The Steelers extended the drive when Harris gained 2 yards on third-and-1 from the Steelers' 47.
The Packers countered with a 13-play, 64-yard drive in 4:51 on their second possession.
Rodgers finished it with a 4-yard scramble for a touchdown. Green Bay converted a third-and-3, a third-and-6 and a third-and-4 on the way to the end zone. Crosby's extra point tied the game at 7-7 with 13:22 left in the second quarter.

Labriola on the win over the Falcons
Steelers.com
If anyone still wonders how good the Steelers' 2024 defense can be, an answer can be found in the video of the team's 18-10 victory over the Falcons in Atlanta on Sunday. And you really should watch the whole video, because it's possible to find special moments throughout an afternoon where the Steelers were either behind or ahead by less than a touchdown for all but 28 seconds of a 60-minute game.
The thing about any discussion of great Steelers' defense is there's more than one right answer. There's an easy case to be made for the 1976 version, because that unit finished first in the NFL in both yards allowed and points allowed; it finished with 46 takeaways and was credited with 41 unofficial sacks; and during a 10-game winning streak that took those Steelers from a 1-4 start to a spot in the AFC Championship Game the defense allowed 42 points while recording 5 shutouts.
But you can't play defense like that anymore. The NFL decided to defang that defense by making it illegal to contact receivers more than 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage before the ball is thrown (the Mel Blount Rule), and liberalizing how offensive linemen were to be allowed to use their hands (because the Steel Curtain had 99.5 sacks over the three previous 14-game seasons).
The next generation very well could point to the 2008 Steelers defense, a unit that was dynamic in terms of sacks (51) and takeaways (29), and this group waged a war of attrition on offenses that was violent and relentless but legal according to the rules of the day. And the cherry on top came at a critical moment in the most important game of the year when Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison authored a pick-six that combined athleticism and relentless effort into a snippet of NFL history. Plus, the way they bludgeoned the Ravens in the AFC Championship Game was the spark that lit the fire of the player safety initiative.
These Steelers don't deserve to be part of the debate where 1976 and 2008 are two of the correct answers, but let's first see how this group fares over the next 16 games to be played over 17 weeks. Then the issue can be revisited.
In Atlanta, though, there wasn't much to not like.
In the context of individual statistics, QB Kirk Cousins completed 16-of-26 for 155 yards (5.9 average per attempt, which is miniscule by NFL standards), with 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions (3 total giveaways), and a rating of 59.0 (similarly miniscule). The Falcons longest play was a 20-yard completion to Ray-Ray McCloud.
Sunday's defense finished with 2 sacks, 7 hits on the quarterback, and 3 takeaways. The Falcons managed just 1 touchdown and got nothing during a second half when their 6 possessions ended: fumble, punt, punt, punt, interception, sack to end the game. That, added to a historical performance by The Chris Boswell and His Magic Leg Show was the motivating force behind the only win during Kickoff Weekend posted by an AFC North Division that's supposed to be the toughest in the league.
"I'm appreciative of that, but to be quite honest with you, we've got high standards and expectations for this group," said Coach Mike Tomlin. "We've got some first team All-Pros in that unit. I expect them to play like that, and they did. Big time players step up in big time moments. I can't say enough about No. 90 and company."
Of course, No. 90 is T.J. Watt, who authored a better performance in terms of impact on the outcome of the game than either Myles Garrett or Micah Parsons, two players favored by recent voters of awards who apparently don't appreciate Watt's relentless will and savvy. Watt finished with 4 tackles, 1 sack, 3 hits on the quarterback, 2 tackles for loss, and 1 fumble recovery, but that's a superficial version of the story.
Late in the first half, his strip-sack on first-and-10 from the Steelers 17-yard line was nullified when an official ruled Watt had jumped the snap count and was offside (disproved by subsequent video but not subject to replay). On the next play, the Falcons scored their only touchdown on an 8-yard Cousins pass to TE Kyle Pitts. Then with 6 minutes and change left in the third quarter, another strip-sack recovered by Atlanta that would've set up a fourth-and-21 at the Falcons 18-yard line was nullified by an illegal use of hands call on Donte Jackson (who more than atoned for the sin with an interception and a 49-yard return that set up a first-and-10 at the Falcons 18-yard line with 2:47 left in the fourth quarter).
Add it all together, and it's game-wrecking stuff. The Falcons lost this game in no small part because they never figured out a way to deal with T.J. Watt. Certainly the ringleader, but Watt wasn't the whole show.
There was the aforementioned interception by Jackson – who sure looked like a nice addition to the defense as a partner with Joey Porter Jr. as the return in the trade of WR Diontae Johnson. DeShon Elliott, another newcomer, made a diving interception in the middle of the field, and he looked like he could turn into a nice complement to Minkah Fitzpatrick. The Falcons did average 4.0 yards per rush, which is a less than ideal number when viewed separately, but they totaled only 89 yards and at no time did it appear as though the Falcons had enough to win by simply running the football.
Maybe unspectacular, but the defensive line was consistent and productive. Cam Heyward had 4 tackles, and Montravius Adams added 3 tackles and 1 sack. Larry Ogunjobi had 2 hits on the quarterback, and CBS showed how one of those encouraged Cousins to unload the throw that became Jackson's interception late in the fourth quarter.
But there were some issues. Too often the passing game either consisted of going deep to George Pickens or it wasn't worth the bother. The Steelers were 0-for-2 in the red zone, and 0-for-1 in goal-to-go situations.
"If you can't get fourth-and-1, sometimes you don't deserve to win. That's just a philosophical approach that we live by," said Tomlin.
"We had some fumbled center-quarterback exchanges on offense," he added. "We were shooting ourselves in the foot. You kick field goals in a hostile environment vs. a good group, you better know you're in danger. I'm just really appreciative that we were able to get it done. We've got things to work on, but it's really good to work on your ills with the 'W.' And so we're going to do that."
A good start to be sure. But only a start.

Plenty to choose from
Steelers.com
The final day of the NFL Scouting Combine put the offensive linemen on center stage at Lucas Oil Stadium and it was worth the wait.
"It's a deep group of starters," NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah assessed of the class available for selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. "Maybe not those elite payers like we had last year but there are a lot of guys that are ready to plug in and play, and a lot of guys with versatility that have some experience playing different positions."
Jeremiah highlighted four such players as examples of what this year's offensive line class has to offer.
Alabama's Tyler Booker, in Jeremiah's estimation, is "plug-and-play" at guard.
Missouri's Armand Membou has experience at guard and offensive tackle.
North Dakota State's Grey Zabel is capable, Jeremiah maintained, of playing all five offensive line positions.
And Ohio State's Donovan Jackson moved from left guard to left tackle after a season-ending injury sustained by Josh Simmons and helped lead the Buckeyes to the national championship.
And there are more where they came from.
"Talent and versatility, that's what screams at you from this group of players," Jeremiah summarized.
Following is a look at some of the highlights of the NFL Network's coverage of Day Four in Indianapolis:
NOT HIRED FOR HIS DISPOSITION: Booker brings a no-nonsense, bash-and-smash approach to his work up front. He told NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales he views football as "legal assault," and that his mission on every down is to make the players he's blocking "not love football."
THE USUAL SUSPECTS: A number of schools had multiple offensive linemen on display.
Texas was represented by offensive tackle Kelvin Banks Jr., guard Hayden Conner, center Jake Majors and offensive tackle Cameron Williams.
Oregon's contingent included offensive tackle Josh Conerly Jr. and offensive tackle Ajani Cornelius.
Ohio State center Seth McLaughlin, Jackson and Simmons were all on hand (Simmons is still recovering from patellar tendon surgery and didn't work out).
And Georgia had guard Dylan Fairchild, guard Tate Ratledge, guard Xavier Truss and center Jared Wilson in Indy.
All four of those schools qualified for the College Football Playoff in 2024.
Ohio State won the national championship.
"There's a pretty good correlation between the number of linemen here and winning a lot of games," NFL Network analyst Charles Davis observed.
FREAK SHOW: Membou shouted his way to a 4.91 on his first 40-yard dash at 6-foot-41/4 and 332 pounds.
It held up as official.
"You let out a primal scream when you do freaky stuff," Jeremiah reasoned. "That is fantastic."
Membou, not surprisingly, didn't bother to run a second 40.
"He's in the mix to be the first offensive lineman off the board," Jeremiah added.
Georgia center Jared Wilson (6-3, 310) came in .01 better than Membou with a first 40 of 4.90 that, likewise, held up as official.
For an encore, Wilson produced a 4.84 on his second 40 attempt which also ended up as an official time, the fifth-fastest time by an offensive lineman at a Combine since 2003 (tied with Richie Incognito in 2005).
Membou's 10-yard split, considered a more significant indicator than the 40 time for offensive linemen, was 1.74, tied for the fourth-best time in his offensive line group (two drilled on Day 4) behind Wilson's 1.71 (first attempt).
Membou and LSU offensive tackle Will Campbell joined Tampa Bay's Tristan Wirfs (in 2020) and San Francisco's Trent Williams (in 2010) as the only offensive linemen who registered a vertical leap of over 30 inches and a sub-5.00 40 at 315 or more pounds at a Combine since 2003.
Campbell's vertical this year was 32" and his 40 was 4.98 at 319 pounds.
Membou delivered a 34" vertical and also had a 9'7" broad jump.
"I was chasing the 4.8 in the 40 but 4.9 is pretty good," Membou told Dales. "Every team, they asked what I view myself as. I just told them I think I'm athletic enough to stay at tackle but I have the versatility to go dominate at guard.
"I'm just excited to bring my explosiveness and my ability to move D-linemen off the ball."
The average offensive lineman 40 time was 5.13, the fastest by an offensive line group at a Combine.
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE MEASURABLES: Campbell is widely regarded as one of the prized offensive line prospects in the draft but there are some who question whether he'll wind up at guard because of his 325/8-inch arms.
Campbell isn't among the concerned.
"It's no secret I don't have the stereotypical offensive lineman arms but I've never had them," he told Dales. "There were concerns when I was coming into college, I handled it fine. And, obviously, there's concerns now and I'm gonna handle it fine whenever a team gives me the opportunity."
College tackles with arms shorter than 33" often end up at guard in the NFL.
But to Campbell that's not necessarily a definitive indicator as to whether a player is better suited for guard or tackle.
Dales also reported Campbell told her "blocking is done with your feet."
AIN'T THAT TOUGH ENOUGH: Jackson didn't run 40s and looked to be struggling to a degree in drills. At one point he received attention from the medical staff and had his right thigh wrapped.
"I don't know that he looks super healthy," Jeremiah said. "You can see a strain on his face as well when he's trying to finish a drill. I admire the competitiveness but it's not necessary at this point. You got 55 starts at Ohio State, that's enough. I love you competing if you're healthy but if you're not 100 percent it's not worth that."
Added Davis, who worked on the field as well as upstairs at an anchor desk: "I said to him, 'Are you OK young man?' He just looked at me and defiantly said, 'I'm doing great,' and just went back to the line.
"He doesn't look right, I think everyone's kind of seeing there may be something a little bit off but he's doing his best to fight his way through it."

It's official: Acrisure Stadium
Steelers.com
Greg Williams is an unabashed Steelers fan. And he wants his company to become as much a part of Pittsburgh as his favorite football team.
Williams is the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Acrisure, and on Tuesday Williams and Steelers President Art Rooney II presided over a news conference to announce a partnership between the two businesses for the naming rights to the venue where the Steelers and the Pitt football team play their home games, where the WPIAL championships are played annually, and where Western Pennsylvania's biggest concerts are held, including appearances by The Rolling Stones, Kenny Chesney, Taylor Swift, U2, Garth Brooks, Beyonce, and Bon Jovi.
At the moment Rooney stepped to the podium and addressed the assembled media in the PNC Champions Club, Heinz Field officially became Acrisure Stadium.
"Starting today, the new name of the stadium is Acrisure Stadium," said Rooney. "Acrisure is a fast-growing, technology driven asset manager in markets around the world. It has an exciting future, and we are pleased to welcome Acrisure as a very important part of the Steelers' future. Before I ask Greg Williams to come up and say a few words, I want to acknowledge Thomas Tull, who was the catalyst in bringing us together."
The naming rights deal is for 15 years, and while Rooney declined to delve into the specifics of the financial arrangement, he did say, "We're certainly pleased with where we are."
Rooney then added, "I think it brings us into a more competitive range with other stadiums around the country, and so that really was the goal – to be able to be in a more competitive situation with our peers."
Williams seemed genuinely happy to have the opportunity to become a partner with the team he first began to follow as an adolescent. "I was born in 1961, and so think about the 1970s and the age I was at that time. Not hard to fall in love with all the winning the Steelers did, but it was also the brand of football, the toughness with which they played. I'm probably one of the rare football fans who like watching defense, and so you go back to those days and see Joe Greene and Ernie Holmes and Dwight White and L.C. Greenwood and Jack Ham and Jack Lambert and the others. The list goes on in terms of the players we watched and were fans of. It was a combination of the winning, and then as you get older – and hopefully a little bit more mature – you also learn to appreciate the quality of the organization.
"The way the Steelers are run, how respected they are as an organization and in terms of how they do things, I would tell you that culturally, there couldn't be a better alignment … There is a cultural alignment here, and I think that is part of why this makes sense as well."

A long-standing part of Steelers culture is the franchise's visibility and activity within the community, and with Acrisure now the team's most visible partner Williams expressed pride in the agreement for the naming rights to the stadium and explained how his company planned to make its mark in Pittsburgh.
"When Thomas called and asked, 'Greg, with you knowing the history in terms of the love that we have for the Steelers, is this something that is kind of a natural partnership?' And it didn't take long to say, yes. Then it was a matter of meeting Art and getting a sense of what the opportunity would need to look like for the Steelers to say yes. And so, with that, it concluded quickly and has come together quickly. And again, we just couldn't be prouder to be affiliated as partners with the Steelers.
"The other thing I will mention is that … once we're involved in something, we're involved. You know Children's Hospital, and in Grand Rapids as an example, once we moved to downtown Grand Rapids, (getting involved with Children's Hospital) was one of the first things that we did, and we can continue to contribute meaningful dollars, tens of millions of dollars to that community. And the intent is to do the same thing here. What we're going to rely on is a lot of help from Art and the Steelers as far as where we can be the most impactful, and so that's something we will lean into as well. We're happy to be here, proud and privileged to be here. Looking forward to getting to know as many of you as we can, while we're again trying to make a real impact in the community beyond just the Pittsburgh Steelers."
Once the news conference morphed into a Q&A, one of the first questions had to do with the potential fate of the ketchup bottles that are a part of the stadium's jumbotron. It can be said that Steelers fans love tradition, just as it also could be pointed out that Steelers fans resist change.
"Well, let me start by saying that we appreciate the 20-plus-year partnership that we had with Heinz," said Rooney, "and we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll continue to have a sponsorship relationship with them. We're having those discussions."

Steelers top Raiders, 32-13
Contributing Writer/Editor
LAS VEGAS - A trip to Las Vegas was just what the doctor ordered for the Steelers to end their two-game losing streak.
Najee Harris rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown, while Chris Boswell kicked four field goals as the Steelers snapped their two-game losing streak with an 32-13 victory here Sunday at Allegiant Stadium over the Raiders.
Harris, who had been bottled up during the Steelers' losses to the Colts and Cowboys that dropped his yards per carry average to just 3.3 yards per attempt, went over 100 yards in his first 12 carries, breaking off a number of long runs, none bigger than his 36-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that was his first score of the season. Quarterback Justin Fields also had a big day on the ground, rushing for two touchdowns as the Steelers had 183 yards on the ground.
Fields also completed 14 of 24 passes for 145 yards.
"I just thought it was a collective effort, not only the bigs but the perimeter people," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "And obviously Naj and everyone else. But I just thought anytime you have a run output like that it's not an individual, it is a collective."

T.J. Watt forced a pair of fumbles for the Steelers (4-2), both of which were recovered by teammates, while Pittsburgh's defense limited the Raiders (2-4) to 57 yards on 19 carries. Patrick Queen had a season-high 13 tackles.
"I don't know what way to state it other than I'm not surprised by it but it doesn't make it any less amazing," Tomlin said of Watt. "If you've been around him during the course of his career here, you just know that he's going to seize those moments. He's going to rise up and be what we need him to be in some form or fashion."
Both teams scored on their opening possessions of the game, as the Steelers took the game's opening kickoff and drove to the Las Vegas 34 before settling for a 52-yard Boswell field goal.
The Raiders, however, answered with an impressive 10-play, 70-yard drive on which quarterback Aidan O'Connell completed all four of his passes for 45 yards and Alexander Mattison had 25 yards on six carries, including a three-yard TD run to cap it off to give Las Vegas a 7-3 lead.
"We just made little adjustments. Things happen. It's the NFL," said Steelers linebacker Elandon Roberts. "Those guys are pros, too. We came to the sideline and we talked about it. We went back out and we did what we needed to do. It's about adjusting on the fly. It's the NFL. You think a team is going to come out and be the same every week? It's not going to happen. We did what we needed to do, talked about it and we moved forward with it."
Las Vegas, however, would go three-and-out on its next two possessions, while the Steelers continued to move the ball.
They added a 49-yard Boswell field goal to cut the lead to 7-6 in the second quarter after Fields missed three-straight passes after a 15-yard run by Harris to the Las Vegas 31.
The Steelers then took the lead late in the first half following a forced fumble by Watt, who punched the ball loose from running back Dylan Laub. The fumble was recovered by Keeanu Benton at the Las Vegas 30.
Fields was intercepted by Divine Deablo on third down, but Adam Butler was penalized for roughing Fields on the play, and the Steelers maintained control of the ball.
That would prove costly, as Fields scored on fourth down from the 3, scrambling around left end. The Steelers failed on a two-point conversion, but took a 12-7 lead to the half.
The Raiders got the ball to open the second half, but were forced to punt after picking up just one first down, their third since getting six on their opening possession. Jeremiah Moon, pressed into a starting role at outside linebacker due to injuries to both Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig, broke through the Las Vegas line to block the punt, giving the Steelers possession at the 9.
On third-and-goal, Fields rolled to his right and threw back across the field to Pat Freiermuth for an apparent touchdown. But he was ruled to have been across the line of scrimmage and the Steelers settled for a 37-yard Boswell field goal and a 15-7 lead.
Harris then willed the Steelers into the end zone on their next possession, breaking off a 26-yard run to midfield and then scoring on a 36-yard run on which he went around left end and raced down the sideline before diving to get the ball over the goal line just before being forced out of bounds by a Raiders' defender.
"When drives aren't going well, you need someone to spark it," said Harris. "I always try to be that person to spark it."
Unfortunately for the Steelers, star rookie center Zach Frazier was injured during the drive when a defender fell into the back of his leg. He was replaced by Ryan McCollum.
Leading 22-7 following the Harris TD, his first of the season, the Steelers defense gave up the first sustained drive it had allowed since the opening possession.
But after a penalty for illegal man downfield negated a Raiders touchdown, Ameer Abdullah ran the ball on second-and-goal from the 11 to the 1. Replay showed Abdullah might have broken the plane of the goal before his knee touched down, but the Raiders hurriedly ran another play and Watt stripped Abdullah of the ball, with DeShon Elliott recovering it, turning Las Vegas away for a chance to cut the game to one score early in the fourth quarter.
Following a Steelers' punt, O'Connell was intercepted by Donte Jackson, his team-best third of the season. Jackson returned the interception to the Las Vegas 7, and one play later, Fields scored on a designed run to put the Steelers ahead, 29-7.
The Raiders scored on their next possession on a 9-yard TD pass from O'Connell to Kristian Wilkerson but their two-point conversion try failed and the Steelers led 29-13 with 4:54 remaining in the game.
Minkah Fitzpatrick recovered an onside kick attempt by the Raiders and Boswell kicked his final field goal to make it 32-13.

Opponents on Steelers
Cardinals are talking about T.J., Cam and more
Steelers.com
The Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday at Acrisure Stadium, a game that will mark the return of running back James Conner to Pittsburgh.
Conner was drafted by the Steelers in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of the University of Pittsburgh and played four seasons in the black and gold.
Conner is excited to return to where his NFL career began and knows it's going to be a tough test.
"It's a special place for sure, starting back in college in the same stadium at Pitt," said Conner. "A special, special place for sure."
Conner and the Cardinals weighed in on Sunday's game, talking about T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward and more.
*  * *
Coach Jonathan Gannon on interim offensive coordinator Eddie Faulkner and Mike Sullivan: "(He's a) good coach. He's been around the block a little bit. Him with Coach Sullivan, I don't really know him personally, but I saw a couple different changes this last week as they kind of took it over and they played good on offense last week, so a big-time challenge."
Gannon on what changes he saw from the Steelers offense this past week: "They always play with high energy. I think that comes from the head coach. The play types were a little bit different, and you could see where they put their emphasis on."
Running back James Conner on Faulkner, who was his running backs coach with the Steelers: "I am excited for him. Coach Eddie works hard. He is well equipped for the job. Consistent day in and day out. Not surprising. I know he is going to do a good job."
Quarterback Kyler Murray on his expectations for Sunday: "I'm expecting a hostile environment, fans that love football and their team. I honestly enjoy playing on the road. We were taught that in college. Just being road warriors and going into another place and winning. That was something we prided ourselves on, so I've tried to take that into the league. It' really a mindset. It's going to be fun though. You don't get many chances to be in environments like this one and I've never been there. Well, I have for a college game, but not since I've been in the league. I'm sure it's going to be a sight to see. We've got to go in there and execute."
Gannon what he's learned about coaching by looking at Coach Mike Tomlin's career: "I know this about Mike Tomlin. He has been there 17 years. His team always plays with a level of physicality and belief that they're going to win every game they play. It's very impressive to watch them, all three units, on tape year to year or week to week—whatever it is. Just prepping for them before on different teams, and then this week all our energy and focus is into this team, but you see that they always show up and obviously he has done a really good job."
Gannon on if the Steelers consistent success is a credit to the coaching and culture: "I think all of it. There's consistency with what they've been doing for a long time. You can see the type of players that they have that they value through their draft process and player acquisition. Coach Tomlin is not confused about who he brings in that building. I know that, and you see it show up."
Conner on playing in Pittsburgh again: "It will be nice. It will be cool. I will have some family at the game. It will be cool to be back."
Conner on what it will mean to play at Acrisure Stadium: "It's a special place for sure, starting back in college in the same stadium at Pitt. As soon as I graduated high school, it was like a month that I got down to training camp and was in Pittsburgh for the whole time. A special, special place for sure."
Conner on if the Steelers take on the personality of Pittsburgh: "You hear the term blue-collar a lot. I feel like it's blue-collar people, the team has a blue-collar style, hard-nosed, steel, all that type of stuff. I think the team takes on the people of the town."
Murray on if James Conner has told him anything about Pittsburgh: "Yeah, he spent a lot of time there. I've just been talking to him about how special his time there was with the guys that he got to play with and how they did things."
Conner on the Steelers run defense and if Cameron Heyward being back changes it: "Physical group for sure. With Cam coming back, he has been the anchor there for years and years. They have had some injuries at linebacker, but you know whoever is going to be there is going to be equipped and ready to play. Cam sets the tone…physical."
Gannon on how the team will manage the offensive matchup in the run game against the Steelers run defense: "Good on good. We told them it's good on good. They've got a really good big-time defense. They've got premier players, they're number one in the league on takeaways, and they're also number one in the league in not giving it away. That's how they win football games. They grind you out and they make some plays.
"On defense they do a really good job of stuffing the run to get you in a known-pass and then taking the ball away in known-pass. That's how they win games on defense.
"On offense they don't give it away, and then they make some plays down the field. They've got some elite skill guys and they run it well on offense, so they control the clock. They shrink the game, and like I just talked about with Coach Tomlin, they have a sense of belief they're going to figure out a way to win the game. Every game that they're in.
"A big-time challenge in a big-time environment. The Terrible Towels will be out. Renegade will be playing. It's a really cool environment. Having played there a couple times, it's one of my favorite venues to play in, truthfully. It's pretty special."
Gannon on if he would put linebacker T.J. Watt in the 'War Daddy' category: "Yeah, I would. You could make the argument he is the best player on defense in the world and you wouldn't get a rebuttal from me when you watch the tape. Just what he does in the run game and in the pass game in affecting the quarterback and the ball. He's very ball aware. He's a high takeaway guy. They drop him and he makes interceptions. He's all over the field and plays with a super high motor. We definitely have to have our eye on that guy all the time."
Gannon on how to game plan for Watt: "He better not get his because he'll train wreck the game. You have to be very aware and there's going to be things that we don't want to do, or we want to do that we can't because we have to limit his impact in the game."
Murray on facing Watt: "Yeah, I'm very aware of him. The last time I suited up against the Steelers was my rookie year, so I've played against him before. Obviously, that was a while ago, but he's a great player. They've got many great players over there so it's going to be a good defense and it's going to be a good challenge for us. We've got to be aware of him and we will be, so we'll try to eliminate him as much as possible."
Conner on getting past Watt: "Run fast. T.J. is a machine. The offensive line will take care of him. He is going to make plays for sure. He is one of the best in the game right now. We've got our hands full with him for sure."
Gannon on if the productivity of tight end Pat Freiermuth has added to their offense: "Yeah, there's no doubt when you got to cover all four or five eligibles."

Steelers defeat Browns 26-14
Steelers.com
Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger didn't put on a show at an emotionally charged Heinz Field on Monday night, but he walked off a winner.
Roethlisberger's 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Diontae Johnson early in the second quarter got things rolling after a slow start and the defense kept the heat on quarterback Baker Mayfield and the Browns' offense throughout in a 26-14 Steelers' victory.
Outside linebacker T.J. Watt had a career high four sacks, increased his total for the season to 21.5 and moved to within one of the NFL single-season record (Michael Strahan, New York Giants, 22.5, 2001).
Kicker Chris Boswell's third field goal of the night, a 50-yard effort, increased a six-point Steelers' lead to nine at 16-7 with 9:45 left in the fourth quarter.
The eight-play drive in 3:51 covered 26 yards, all on the ground.
Running back Najee Harris carried on the first four plays of the march and gained 23 yards to the Cleveland 34-yard line. Harris emerged from the drive with a season-high 136 yards on 23 carries for the night.
He finished with 190 yards on a season-high 28 attempts, including a 37-yard touchdown run that provided the exclamation point with 51 seconds left in the fourth quarter.

Boswell had added a 48-yard field goal at the end of a four-play, 7-yard effort in 1:35, for a 19-7 lead with 5:48 remaining in the fourth.
Roethlisberger went 24 of 46 passing for 123 yards, with one touchdown and one interception.
The crowd of 63,624 chanted "Let's Go Ben" throughout and "Thank You Ben" as the final seconds ticked off the clock.
The Steelers improved to 8-7-1, clinched a non-losing season for the 15th straight season under head coach Mike Tomlin and kept their postseason hopes afloat.
The Steelers' last losing season occurred in 2003 (6-10).
They drafted Roethlisberger on the first round in 2004.
The Browns, who had been eliminated from playoff contention on Sunday, fell to 7-9.
The Steelers completed a season sweep of the Browns after having won, 15-10, on Oct. 31 in Cleveland.
The Steelers need a victory in this Sunday's regular-season finale at Baltimore, an Indianapolis loss this Sunday at Jacksonville and this Sunday night's Los Angeles Chargers-at-Las Vegas game not to end in a tie to qualify for the playoffs as a Wild Card.
Roethlisberger confirmed last week Monday night's appearance might well be his last at Heinz Field after 18 seasons with the Steelers.
"I would say that all signs are pointing to this could be it," he had noted.
Harris surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the season on his fourth carry. A 6-yard gain on first-and-10 from the Steelers' 31 on the Steelers' second possession pushed Harris' total for the season to 1,005 yards on the ground.
Roethlisberger finished the first quarter with seven completions in 12 attempts for 19 yards. Two of his first four connections lost yardage, a toss to tight end Pat Freiermuth for a loss of 4 and a hookup with Harris that lost 2.
The touchdown pass to Johnson capped a 10-play, 66-yard drive in 4:14.
Boswell's extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead with 10:39 left in the first half.
The drive was extended by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Browns defensive end Jadeveon Clowney for throwing wide receiver Chase Claypool's shoe after a pass to Claypool on third-and-10 from the Browns' 36 had gained 3 yards.
Cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon intercepted Mayfield at the Cleveland 43 with 7:03 remaining before the break.
Witherspoon produced his team-leading third interception in his ninth appearance with the Steelers this season.
The Steelers turned the turnover into a 22-yard field goal by Boswell that finished off an 11-play, 39-yard drive in 4:01 for a 10-0 lead with 3:02 left in the first half.
The Browns' No. 3 rushing attack was held to 50 yards on nine carries, one a 32-yard burst by running back Nick Chubb, in the first two quarters.
Cleveland finished with 93 yards on 20 carries on the ground.
Mayfield completed four of 15 passes for 58 yards and was sacked twice, both times by Watt and both times on a third down, in the first 30 minutes.
He added a third on the night and pushed his season total to 20.5 on a third down in the third quarter. That made Watt the 12th player in NFL history to amass 20 sacks in a season.
Harris rushed 13 times for 71 yards in the first half.
He went over 100 yards for the third time this season on his 14th carry of the night, a season-long 30-yard jaunt that included a stiff-arm of Browns safety M.J. Stewart Jr. on the Steelers' first possession of the second half.
That helped set up a 30-yard field goal by Boswell that concluded an 11-play, 66-yard drive in 4:16 that increased the Steelers' lead to 13-0 with 8:20 left in the third.
The Browns didn't get on the scoreboard until 56 seconds remained in the third.
Mayfield's 3-yard pass to tight end David Njoku completed a four-play, 48-yard drive in 2:02. Kicker Chase McLaughlin's extra point sliced the Steelers' lead to 13-7.
Mayfield's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Harrison Bryant and McLaughlin's extra point with 1:10 left drew Cleveland to within 19-14.
Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick recovered the Browns' onside kick with 1:09 remaining.
J.C. Hassenauer started at center in place of Kendrick Green, who had been questionable with a calf injury.
Marcus Allen and Robert Spillane started at inside linebacker with Devin Bush and Joe Schobert on the Reserve/COVID-19 list. Ulysees Gilbert III also saw snaps at inside linebacker.
Corliss Waitman punted and held for Boswell in place of Pressley Harvin III (questionable, personal reasons/illness).
Witherspoon played cornerback opposite Joe Haden in sub-packages and Cam Sutton moved inside with nickel cornerback Arthur Maulet unavailable (Reserve/COVID-19 list).

Labriola on the loss to the Browns
Steelers.com
It was a humbling experience all the way around.
The Steelers were flying high after their fifth straight win, an 18-16 bar fight with the Ravens left them at 8-2 and a topic among the talking heads as a team in the mix for a top 2 seed in the AFC. They also knew what awaited them in Cleveland, because as the Steelers boarded their buses on Saturday for the short drive up the Turnpike, among their baggage were 3 losses in their previous four trips to the shores of Lake Erie.
And while the "on paper" assessment showed the Steelers with an edge in every category based on the first 10 games of this regular season, a blowout was not in the forecast. The Browns still would need help from the Steelers, and it was provided in what ended up being a 24-19 loss on Thursday Night Football.
The Browns were being quarterbacked by Jameis Winston after Deshaun Watson was forced to the injured reserve list, and Winston had been in the league long enough to have a reputation.
The first overall pick of the 2015 NFL Draft by Tampa Bay, Winston was a starter from Day 1 for the Buccaneers. During his 5 seasons there, Winston led the NFL in attempts, yards, and interceptions, while also throwing at least 19 touchdown pass in each of those seasons. In a word, he was a gunslinger.
But the thing about gunslingers is they end up getting shot. In 101 regular season games, Winston threw 102 interceptions and taken 207 sacks. Probably figure on 400 hits on the quarterback to go along with those sacks and interceptions.
Winston had developed a pattern. Always a tough guy, but if pressured Winston would take sacks and make mistakes with the football. In a loss to the Chargers on Nov. 3, he took 6 sacks and threw 3 interceptions under consistent pressure. But the previous week, he put up 335 yards and 3 touchdowns passes in a win over the Ravens because they let him off the hook by dropping a couple of interceptions.
The individual matchups the Steelers needed to win to put necessary pressure on Winston all seemed to be in their favor. The Browns' starting left tackle was on IR, and the next man up had been ruled out of this game with a knee injury. Their starting left tackle became Germain Ifedi, a journeyman who had been with 5 teams since being a No. 1 pick by Seattle in 2016, and their starting right tackle was Jack Conklin, another former No. 1 pick who had been on and off IR and PUP 5 times since November 2021.
That the Steelers ended up with 1 sack and 6 hits on Winston while he passed for 219 yards, including completions of 29, 26, 24, and 18 yards, and 1 touchdown is statistical evidence their pass rush was not what needed it to be.
The situation was just as grim when the Steelers had the football. Twice they went for it on fourth-and-short, and they lost yardage both times. Their rushing total of 120 was enhanced by one 30-yard dash down the sideline by Justin Fields. And the Browns pass rush sacked Russell Wilson 4 times and hit him a9 times, with Myles Garrett going off for 3 sacks and a forced fumble in the first half. Garrett won coming off edge, and once he started on the edge and looped into the middle before coming in clean for his third sack.
And to some degree, the Steelers had themselves to blame, because having 12 of their 34 rushing attempts end up as no gain or minus-yardage put them in the multiple one-dimensional passing situations that teed up Garrett. Even on completed passes for chunks of yardage, Wilson took some shots from a defensive front that looked to be getting the better of the play.
In the early stages of the game, the Steelers were party to a sequence of events that gave the 2-8 Browns hope and allowed their confidence to grow. Their first two offensive possessions ended with a missed field goal and then a turnover on downs when they lost yardage on fourth-and-2. After the Steelers took a 3-0 lead on a 48-yard field goal, the Browns responded with a 12-play, 80-yard touchdown drive, and then Garrett followed with his strip-sack 2 plays later, which made it a 10-3 deficit when Dustin Hopkins cashed in the turnover with a 34-yard field goal.
It was 10-3 at halftime, and the script had been flipped. As James Harrison used to say, "It ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun." The Browns believed they could win, and as their confidence grew the Cleveland partisans among the 67,431 reacted in full throat. The team they had watched go 1-4 in their first 5 inside Huntington Bank Field had a hated rival on the ropes.
But these Steelers do not go quietly. They arrived in Cleveland having found ways to win with defense, or with special teams. They actually were 2-0 in games where they couldn't cross the goal line. So it was completely in character for them to rise up and take a 19-18 lead with 6:13 remaining in the fourth quarter.
The comeback began with a 13-play, 71-yard field goal drive that included a 35-yard hookup to Van Jefferson and a fourth-and-1 conversion pass to Pat Freiermuth. At that point, with the bowl of the stadium resembling a freshly-shaken snow globe, the Steelers could've used a stop from a defense that entered the game ranked No. 2 in the NFL in points allowed. Instead, the Browns answered with a touchdown that capped a 10-play, 65-yard drive and included an 18-yard completion to the backup tight end and a 29-yard completion to the practice squad call-up tight end.
Staying in character, the Steelers then put together 6 minutes of the kind of complementary football they hadn't played all night. It began with a 7-play, 69-yard drive that included 5 running plays, and was capped by Jaylen Warren's 3-yard run. The deficit cut to 18-13, the defense delivered a dynamic play when Nick Herbig blew past Ifedi and strip-sacked Winston, with DeShon Elliott recovering at the Cleveland 27-yard line. Two plays after the takeaway, Wilson spotted Austin down the middle in a snow squall and delivered a perfect pass. The 23-yard touchdown gave the Steelers a 19-18 lead.
With 4:28 remaining and the Browns staring down a third-and-10 from the Steelers 38-yard line, Bad Jameis showed up. Winston missed WR Elijah Moore badly, and Donte Jackson made the catch for the defense's second takeaway in just a little over two-and-a-half-minutes.
Now it was time for the 8-2 team, the AFC North Division leading team, the team on a five-game winning streak to put the 2-8 opponent to bed. Win its sixth one-score game of the season. Be what it's supposed to be.
But each phase contribute to the failure. The offense went three-and-out. Punter Corliss Waitman, who came into the game averaging 46.4 and had kicks of 51, 52, 71, and 52 yards the previous Sunday vs. the Ravens, hit a 15-yard shank. Then the defense had a chance to close out the game but could not meet the challenge.
Good Jameis returned. He converted a fourth-and-3 with a 5-yard pass to WR Jerry Jeudy, and then a third-and-6 with a 15-yard pass to Jeudy. Two runs by Nick Chubb at the heart of the Steelers defense later, and 19-18 had become a 24-19 deficit with 57 seconds left. Dagger.
The Browns hate the Steelers with the same intensity that the Steelers hate the Ravens, and they had come away with a victory that seemed so unlikely three hours earlier. The Steelers still will sit atop the AFC North and their 8-3 still will be one of the top three records in the conference at Thanksgiving. But this one is going to leave a mark.

Wilson expected to be No. 2 QB on Sunday
Steelers.com
Coach Mike Tomlin said that quarterback Russell Wilson will 'probably' be active on Sunday as the No. 2 quarterback when the team takes on the Las Vegas Raiders. Justin Fields is once again expected to start, his six straight with the black and gold.
Wilson has not been active at all this season while dealing with a calf injury, going into each game as the No. 3/emergency quarterback.
"He's probably going to be active as the No. 2 quarterback," said Tomlin. "I like what I've seen out here. Again, health and rust are two different things. I thought he had a good week displaying his health, his ability to protect himself. Now it's just a process of getting re-acclimated to the ball."
Wilson was a full participant in practice all week and said he is making progress.
"I was able to do a lot more this week," said Wilson. "It was exciting to get back out there and be a full participant and do everything, all the reps and everything else."
Wilson was asked on Thursday about his expectations for Sunday and what he thinks his role will be. He didn't have a definitive answer. "That's a big question," said Wilson. "I'm preparing my mind to get ready to go and everything else, so that's kind of my mentality and help us win and whatever that is. And so yeah, I'm just getting prepared for (today)."
In other injury news, running back Jaylen Warren, who has missed the last two games with an ankle injury was a full participant in practice on Friday and will be listed as questionable.
"He was a full participant today," said Tomlin. "Good trajectory on the upswing. Feeling optimistic about his inclusion, he's listed as questionable."

Tomlin: Bye offered Steelers time for evaluation
Bye weeks in the NFL are a time for players to get away from the daily grind of preparation for the next game.
For coaches, it's a time to evaluate what you're doing, who you're doing it with and all of the other questions that go along with those things.
What those discoveries mean and how they affect the rest of the team's season will begin to be revealed when the Steelers (3-2) come out of their bye week against the Rams (3-3) in Los Angeles on Sunday.
"(I'm) really excited about getting back into competition coming off the bye week," Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex. "(It was) an opportunity for self-analysis in all three phases, what we do well, what we don't do well, strategic things, how we divide the labor up. We went through those things with a fine tooth comb as a staff, spent some time addressing some of those things.
"And then we spent some time looking ahead, not only in terms of the games that are upcoming like like the one this week, but also just kind of trends in the game to have a little bit of a global perspective about some things that are going on where we stack up our place in an effort to provide your proper focus in terms of areas that we need to improve. I think that's a reasonable expectation as you come out of a bye, that opportunity for reflection and self-analysis should be a springboard for better performance, for better strategy for better division of labor."
Tomlin isn't saying what the team learned about itself during the self-analysis period, but if it provides a spark like it did a year ago, the Steelers could be in for bigger and better things in the second half.
The team went into the bye a year ago at 2-6 and averaging less than 100 yards rushing per game. Post-bye, the Steelers made a commitment to their rushing attack and averaged 146.2 yards per game on the ground in the second half, improving their scoring average by more than a touchdown in their final nine games as they went 7-2 after the mid-season break.
That helped improve the team's third-down success to 54 percent in the second half and made things easier on then-rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett.
A similar improvement this season would be a welcome addition for a team that is off to a better start in terms of its record in what appears to be a tight AFC North race. While the Steelers were off last week, Baltimore (4-2), Cleveland (3-2) and Cincinnati (3-3) all won their respective games, leaving the AFC North as the only division in the NFL in which all four teams are at .500 or better.
Also as was the case a year ago, when the Steelers got T.J. Watt back from injured reserve following the bye week, the Steelers will welcome the potential return of a number of injured players following the bye.
Guard James Daniels, tackle Dan Moore Jr., punter Pressley Harvin III and tight end Pat Freiermuth all have missed at least one game due to injury prior to the bye, but have an opportunity to return this week. The Steelers also activated the 21-day window for wide receiver Diontae Johnson and running back Anthony McFarland Jr. on Monday to return from injured reserve.
"It's always a great opportunity to sort some things out from a health standpoint to put some people back toward participation," Tomlin said. "It was for us."
But who participates and who immediately moves back into the starting lineup isn't a given.
Sometimes, self-evaluation is involved. Other times, not.
"Decisions are made by guys like me, day in and day out in this business," Tomlin said. "Some of this is very black-and-white information or some of it is gut-oriented. Some of it is a mix of the two. And that's how it gets done. So I try not to do it specifically with a cookie cutter because you miss opportunities to get better.
"You have variables and unique variables and all circumstances that require analysis. And so I'm comfortable enough in my skin and in my position that I don't make cookie-cutter decisions. I do them on an individual basis."
Getting their shots: Playing time continues to increase for members of the Steelers rookie class, with injuries playing a part in some instances, but creating their own opportunity in others.
First-round pick Broderick Jones started against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 5 with Dan Moore Jr. out injured. While no decision has been made on who will start this week with Moore coming back from his injury, Coach Mike Tomlin liked what he saw from Jones and said the experience is the best teacher.
"The in-helmet perspective of play that you can't get anywhere else but playing," said Tomlin. "He hasn't been deficient in learning in any of the other venues. It's just a process and opportunity."
Defensive lineman Keeanu Benton also falls under the taking advantage of an opportunity umbrella. Benton, one of the Steelers second round draft picks this year, has seen his playing time increase due to the injury to Cameron Heyward.
"That is a young guy that is utilizing all of his avenues to get better," said Tomlin. "The opportunity avenue has increased for him because of Cam Heyward's injury. I think with more exposure, he is playing more consistently and getting more comfortable. I am excited about the continued trajectory of that."
Fellow second-round pick Joey Porter Jr. was utilized in key situations against the Ravens, and the reason wasn't because of injuries, but because of what he is showing.
"With each passing week, we get an understanding of what the young guys are capable of," said Tomlin. "We're gaining a better understanding, particularly at the early portions of the year about how to best divide our labor up in an effort to win a game. We did against the Baltimore Ravens what we thought was necessary to win that game and will continue to do so."
Tomlin envisions many of the young players seeing more playing time as they progress.
"There are several variables at play," said Tomlin. "It's what they do and the quality in which they do it. It's also the opportunity. Such is always the case in team play. Things and decisions don't happen in a vacuum.
"We challenge all of these guys to not be patient. This is not a patient persons' business. We ask them to work while they wait for their opportunity and then put their readiness on display."
No secret: The Steelers have the potential to get a huge offensive weapon back this week as receiver Diontae Johnson was cleared to return to practice on Monday.
Johnson was placed on the Reserve/Injured List after suffering a hamstring injury against the San Francisco 49ers in the season opener.
Coach Mike Tomlin said Johnson's work during the week in practice and his overall conditioning will play a role in whether he is activated this week or further down the road, as the team has a 21-day window to make a decision.
Johnson had three receptions for 48 yards against the 49ers before leaving the game in the third quarter. He said last week he is 100 percent and getting him back gives the Steelers a weapon the offense would welcome.
"Expert route running," said Tomlin of what he brings. "He is a route runner. Vertical, non-vertical. He can create separation at break points.
"That is his distinguishing trait, but that is no secret."
Asked if his presence could help quarterback Kenny Pickett, especially early in games, Tomlin's answer was simple.
"Very much," he said.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 25

Let's get to it:
RANDY HOFFERT FROM NEW HOLLAND, PA: The Steelers should have drafted Tyler Guyton instead of Troy Fautanu. Guyton is a better player and not made of plastic. Fautanu couldn't stay healthy in college and he won't stay healthy in the pros. ANSWER: Troy Fautanu (6-4, 317) was selected 20th overall in the 2024 NFL Draft by the Steelers, and Tyler Guyton (6-7, 322) was selected 29th overall by Dallas in the same draft. While Fautanu did injure a knee and missed all but 55 snaps of his rookie season, Guyton appeared in 15 games, with 11 starts as a rookie. In his 670 offensive snaps, Guyton was flagged for 5 holding penalties, 5 false start penalties, and he committed two other penalties that either were declined or were part of an offsetting foul situation. Your assertion that Fautanu "couldn't stay healthy in college" is not supported by facts. Fautanu played 41 games in his four seasons at the University of Washington, including 28 games in his final two college seasons (2022-23). I don't know whether it'll be Fautanu or Guyton who ends up with a longer/better professional career, and I suspect that you don't know either.
MASON CHRISTOPHER FROM WINAMAC, IN: Will Justin Fields be returning to the Steelers? ANSWER: I think we should have the answer to that question when free agency begins on Wednesday, March 12.
JAROD ALLISON FROM ROCKWOOD, PA: I took a look at some of the names of former Steelers who may be available via free agency. Names include Artie Burns, Kelvin Beachum, Javon Hargrave, Robert Spillane, Juju Smith-Schuster, Mason Rudolph, Kendrick Green, Devin Bush, Mike Hilton, Diontae Johnson, Chukwuma Okorafor. Anyone in there you'd have an interest in signing to strengthen a position? ANSWER: Me? No.
TIMOTHY PAULL FROM PAHRUMP, NV: With the years of poor offensive production, do you attribute this to just not having the playmaking talent at the skill positions, or is it not getting creative offensive coordinators, or is it schematics that are antiquated, or some combination? ANSWER: Talent is what wins in the NFL. People become too enamored with the concept of schemes and game plans and play-calls, but Super Bowl LIX definitively showed that none of that matters if the other guys are better. The Chiefs offensive line was handled on a consistent basis, and the Eagles managed that without blitzing. When that is happening, you can have a great quarterback (Patrick Mahomes) and a superior strategist (Andy Reid), and that's not going to be enough. The Steelers have used the previous couple of offseasons to invest in their offensive line, and now it's necessary to address the issue that's been identified as an offseason priority. Quarterback. I believe what you're referring to as "years of poor offensive production" coincide with the seasons following Ben Roethlisberger's retirement. And the goal isn't to find the next Ben Roethlisberger – because that might never happen – but to find a way to get more consistently effective play at the quarterback position.
LUKAS CARDINAL FROM SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA: When do you think the Steelers will make a decision at quarterback for the 2025 season? I understand they want to do their due diligence on exploring every option, but we've seen them make other moves. Just curious if you could provide some insight. ANSWER: I have written this before, and not just once, that I believe the aim is to have identified and then signed the better of the Russell Wilson-Justin Fields option by the start of free agency on Wednesday, March 12. Doing that would open up the rest of the offseason for the Steelers to explore ways to deal with other areas of the depth chart they identify as being in need of reinforcement or an injection of top-level talent.
DAN COLOMBIN FROM OKMULGEE, OK: Did Steelers hire Hines Ward as coach? ANSWER: No. Hines Ward is the receivers coach at Arizona State.
MIKE WINN FROM SARATOGA SPRINGS, NY: I know there are a lot of questions about the Steelers quarterback situation for next year. I saw New England's No. 3 quarterback – Joe Milton III – play in the season finale vs. Buffalo. Granted it was a meaningless game for the Bills, but Milton, who is 6-foot-5, looked good. He threw some accurate passes and made some good decisions. He would be a project and a gamble, but he would also be relatively cheap to acquire, no? ANSWER: No. Joe Milton III played 6 college seasons – 3 for Michigan and then 3 for Tennessee – and he appeared in 43 games for the Wolverines and Volunteers, where he completed 400-of-649 (61.3 percent) for 5,353 yards, with 37 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also rushed 174 times for 661 yards (3.8 average) and 12 more touchdowns. All of that sounds good, but Milton entered the NFL as a sixth-round pick of New England (193rd overall) in 2024, which means the Patriots have total control over his rights for the next 3 seasons. In the unlikely event the Patriots would cut him, Milton would be subject to waivers, and the Steelers would be 21st in priority to claim him. And because Milton is on the books for the veteran minimum salary for the next 3 years, the notion that the Patriots would want to trade him based on the miniscule value he would bring back to them isn't realistic in the least.
NICHOLAS MOSES FROM SIMI VALLEY, CA: Javon Hargrave seems like a logical choice for the Steelers to pursue this offseason given their poor run defense. What are your thoughts on that? Also, please tell me the Steelers would not seriously consider signing a 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers. ANSWER: My thoughts on both of the options you present is that it makes as much sense to sign a 32-year-old NT who played in only 3 games in 2024 after a season-ending torn triceps in Week 3 to help the run defense as it would to think signing a 41-year-old would be the answer at quarterback.
LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM, PA: I thought Corliss Waitman was effective enough as an injury replacement for Cameron Johnston as the Steelers punter. But was he effective enough for the Steelers to give him an opportunity in 2025? I assume Waitman will be a free agent come March 12. Am I correct? ANSWER: Corliss Waitman is under contract to the Steelers for the 2025 season for a reported salary of $1.1 million.

Craig Wolfley, 66
Steelers.com
He spent most of his adult life working within the world of professional sports, and his world was not one for the faint of heart. Football, and in the middle of the line of scrimmage at that. Boxing. Sumo wrestling. Martial arts. Competitive weight lifting. In all of those, he was a combatant, a hand-to-hand warrior who gave as good as he got, a man who didn't have it in him to back down from a fight.
But that was only one part of the man. If you weren't opposite him on a line of scrimmage, or in boxing's square-circle, or in any of those other mano-a-mano competitive confrontations, Craig Wolfley was a kind and gentle soul. Loving, supportive, understanding, giving of his time and of himself, fiercely loyal.
Craig Wolfley died on March 10. He was 66.
"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Craig Wolfley, a beloved member of the Pittsburgh Steelers family," said President Art Rooney II. "Craig was an outstanding player who brought both toughness and heart to the field during his 10 seasons with the Steelers. As an offensive lineman, his grit and dedication were essential to our success, contributing to the solid foundation of the Steelers' offensive line in the 1980s. His work ethic and commitment to excellence were felt both in the locker room and on the field, and his leadership was always evident.
"Following his retirement from playing, Craig seamlessly transitioned into a broadcaster, providing insightful commentary and analysis as part of the Steelers Audio Network. His passionate voice and deep understanding of the game made him a trusted figure for Steelers fans, and his humor, warmth, and enthusiasm left a lasting impact on our community.
"On behalf of the entire Steelers organization, we offer our deepest condolences to Craig's family, friends, and all who had the privilege of knowing him."
A fifth-round pick (138th overall) in the 1980 NFL Draft out of Syracuse University, Wolfley was part of the class that also brought Tunch Ilkin to the team in the sixth round (165th overall) from Indiana State. Wolfley and Ilkin spent five-plus NFL seasons holding down the left side of the Steelers offensive line, and the men became best of friends. The depth of that friendship came across on the air during broadcasts of "In the Locker Room with Tunch and Wolf" on Steelers Nation Radio, and then also during the Steelers Audio Network's broadcasts of games when Wolfley was added to the Bill Hillgrove-Tunch Ilkin team as the sideline reporter. And that relationship seemed to grow up until Ilkin's death in September 2021.
"Training camp was always easy (doing the two-hour talk show with Wolf every day)," Mr. Ilkin once said about their time together as broadcasters. "Wolf and I would compare training camp today with what training camp was like when we were playing. I had fun doing 'Inside the Locker Room,' and if we weren't doing it together, I never would've done a five-days-a-week show. I did it with him, and we did it well together. I also loved it when Wolf joined the broadcast team and would come along on road trips. We continued to be roommates on those trips like we were as players. We would sit on a bench outside and have a cigar when we got to the hotel, and then we'd have another one before we'd get on the bus to go to the stadium for the game the next day."
After Ilkin's death, Wolfley partnered with Max Starks on the 2-hour, 5-day-a-week talk show on SNR and then moved into the booth alongside Hillgrove when Starks was added as the sideline reporter.
Wolfley quickly became known for his on-air delivery, which could be described as high-energy mixed with a penchant for making up words to emphasize a point, but he had learned about the need to study film during a career where he played along with Mike Webster and Larry Brown and he understood the importance of technique and fundamentals from being coached by Chuck Noll.
One of the skills Wolfley showcased during the last decade or so was his writing ability, as in long-form pieces that were analytical, anecdotal, and enjoyable to read. That he could be seen huddled over a notebook with a pen writing his stories by hand in cursive only added to the self-deprecating way he always viewed his own work. But Craig Wolfley could write. And he knew football, and he loved the Steelers.
"Just the energy and the passion that he brought to life," said Charlie Batch. "Not just from a Steelers perspective, but he genuinely cared about people … "Ultimately, he was able to share that as he went from the sideline to the booth. And he brought a different element. People enjoyed listening to him … The older I got in my playing career, knowing that I wanted to transition into that media side, he would give me tips and little things that he may have done that helped him get to that transition point. And then ultimately, having the chance to work with him and Tunch Ilkin on different shows. They were two peas in a pod."
That was Craig Wolfley after his playing career. During his 12-year playing career, he was a full-time starter in the interior of an NFL line of scrimmage during the 1980s, and he had the demeanor required of that job description.
"I remember our first encounter in camp was a fight," said Edmund Nelson, a defensive tackle who came to the Steelers as a No. 7 pick (172nd overall) from Auburn in the 1982 NFL Draft. "He was the first guy that I went up against in the Oklahoma drills Chuck Noll used to have. Me and him went at it the first day that the veterans reported up to camp. He body-slammed me on the first play, and then I body-slammed him on the second play. Then we just went at it. Craig and I told this story all the time, that by the time the end of practice came, we were so tired and so beat, we grabbed each other and helped each other up the hill to the locker room. That was Craig Wolfley in a nutshell. We would go at each other in camp, and then we were buddies at the end of the day. Craig lived in the same area as me after playing … Him and I would see each other every home game, and we greeted each other with a big hug. And in that hug, there was something that was 45 years' worth of friendship old. There was just a genuineness to him, a good God-fearing man. That's the main thing … I'm going to miss my hugs from Craig."
Said Dermontti Dawson: "Wolf had a bigger-than-life personality. And he was a man of faith. God was No. 1 in his life … He was upbeat all the time. And he called you 'brother,' and that was his thing. He would always call you 'brother,' and it's because you truly were family to him."
And Wolfley's "family" extended into the community, where he participated in blood drives, walks to raise money, would contribute to a charitable gathering by grabbing the microphone and entertaining the assembled group with stories about his playing and broadcasting careers. "He was truly one of those unique human beings," said Merril Hoge. "He was genuine, fair and kind. That's a pretty good recipe."
Bill Hillgrove: "Not only in the booth, but out of the booth, Wolf was a special person. The last couple of years when I was working the Steelers games, between two knee replacements and a back operation, I struggled to carry my luggage on and off the plane during road trips. Wolf always made sure he got it up and down the steps or out of the overhead bin. He was so kind in that regard … Wolf was a naturally funny man. He didn't try to be funny. He just was naturally funny. He did everything with his sense of humor. I'll miss him so much. He was a special person. He didn't wear glasses, but if he did, they would be rose-colored glasses."
Craig Wolfley is survived by his wife, Faith, and daughters Megan, Hannah, and Esther, and sons, Kyle, "CJ", and "Max." (Teresa Varley contributed to this story.)

Steelers defeat Bengals, 23-20 in OT
Steelers.com
CINCINNATI - Mike Tomlin entered the season expecting dominance from his defense.
He got it for openers against the Bengals.
Cincinnati's first two snaps resulted in a sack of quarterback Joe Burrow by defensive tackle Cam Heyward and an interception and 31-yard return for a touchdown by free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick.
Before the first quarter ended, Heyward added a fumble recovery and outside linebacker Alex Highsmith collected two of the Steelers' three sacks.
Before the second quarter was two minutes old, outside linebacker T.J. Watt came up with the Steelers' second interception.
And before the first half concluded, cornerback Cam Sutton registered the Steelers' third interception of Burrow.
The Steelers kept defending through the final seconds of regulation and found just enough offense in what became a 23-20 overtime victory this afternoon at Paycor Stadium.
Kicker Chris Boswell won it with a 53-yard field goal on the final play of overtime.
The Steelers (1-0) finished with 267 total net yards.
The Bengals (0-1) gained 432.
The Steelers got the ball first in the extra session but were unable to generate a first down and punted.
The Bengals had a chance to end it with 3:33 left in OT but kicker Evan McPherson missed a 29-yard field goal attempt.
Then the Steelers missed an opportunity to secure victory when Boswell hit the left upright on a 54-yard field goal attempt.
The Bengals punted the ball back to the Steelers with 56 seconds left in the overtime.
Completions from Trubisky to tight end Pat Freiermuth for a combined 36 yards got the ball to the Bengals' 35-yard line and set the stage for Boswell's game-winning kick.
Watt (pec) and running back Najee Harris (foot) didn't play in the overtime after sustaining injuries in the fourth quarter.
The Bengals turned a second-and-goal from the Steelers' 6-yard line with four seconds left in the fourth quarter into a touchdown pass from Burrow to wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase.
But Fitzpatrick blocked McPherson's extra point attempt with two seconds left in regulation.
Cincinnati's game-tying drive began at the Bengals' 40 with 1:27 left in the fourth.
The Bengals cut an 11-point halftime deficit to three at 17-14 with a nine-play, 46-yard drive in 5:44 that ended with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to wide receiver Tyler Boyd and a two-point conversion pass from Burrow to wide receiver Mike Thomas with 4:41 left in the third quarter.
The Steelers responded with a seven-play, 15-yard drive in 2:08 that delivered a 48-yard field goal from Boswell and a 20-14 lead with 11:13 left in the fourth.
The short-field possession was set up by a 20-yard punt return by wide receiver Gunner Olszewski to the Bengals' 45.
Cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon ended Cincinnati's next drive with the Steelers' fourth interception, a theft of a Burrow pass intended for wide receiver Tyler Boyd on fourth-and-6 from the Steelers' 36.
The subsequent Bengals' possession reached the Steelers 1 and came down to fourth-and-goal from the 1 on the first snap inside the two-minute warning.
Burrow's pass into the end zone for Chase was deflected by Sutton and fell incomplete.
The Bengals countered Fitzpatrick's early pick-six with a Bengals-record 59-yard field goal by McPherson that cut the Steelers' lead to 7-3 with 7:17 left in the first quarter.

A forced fumble by Highsmith and Heyward's recovery set the Steelers up at the Bengals' 34 and a 31-yard connection between Trubisky and Freiermuth established a first-and-goal at the Cincinnati 3. But the Steelers settled for a 20-yard field goal by kicker Chris Boswell and a 10-3 lead with 2:25 left in the opening quarter.
Watt's interception set the table for what became a seven-play, 59-yard drive in 4:22 that ended with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Harris.
Boswell's extra point upped the Steelers' lead to 17-3 with 8:46 remaining prior to halftime.
McPherson's second field goal, this one from 20 yards, ended a drive that reached the Steelers' 4 but went backwards from there with 14 seconds left in the second.

Player of the Week
Wilson is Digest Player of the Week
Steelers.com
RUSSELL WILSON Quarterback
The typical tradition is to give presents to someone celebrating a birthday. But 48 hours after his 36th birthday, Russell Wilson gave the Steelers a present.
Wilson was the triggerman for an offense that was historically productive in a game the Steelers absolutely needed to win vs. a division opponent that had scored 30-plus points five times coming into the weekend and would do it a sixth time in this game. Wilson completed 29-of-38 (76.3 percent) for 414 yards, with 3 touchdowns, 1 interception, and a rating of 126.4. It was the first time a Steelers quarterback passed for 400 yards since Ben Roethlisberger did it in Denver on Nov. 25, 2018, and the first time the team scored 40 points since it posted 41 vs. Atlanta on Oct. 17, 2018. He completed passes to 10 different receivers – 3 tight ends, 3 running backs, and 4 wide receivers; he changed plays at the line of scrimmage based on the pre-snap look from the Bengals defense; and he provided the Steelers with the best quarterback play they have had since before Roethlisberger's elbow surgery.
For his part in the 44-38 victory in Cincinnati, Wilson is the Steelers Digest Player of the Week.
Also considered were DT Cam Heyward, who had 5 tackles, including 2 for loss, 1 sack, and a tipped pass at the line of scrimmage that was intercepted by CB Donte Jackson; OLB T.J. Watt, who had 3 tackles, 2 sacks, 5 hits on the quarterback and a forced fumble; RB Najee Harris, who rushed for 75 yards on 16 carries (4.7 average) and 1 touchdown and added 6 catches for 54 more yards to finish with 129 yards from scrimmage; ILB Payton Wilson, who had 3 tackles and 2 fumble recoveries, one of which he returned 21 yards for a touchdown; OLB Nick Herbig, who had 2 tackles, 1 sack, 2 hits on the quarterback, and the forced fumble that Wilson returned for the touchdown; TE Pat Freiermuth, who caught 6 passes for 68 yards (11.3 average) and a 25-yard touchdown; and SS DeShon Elliott, who led the team with 11 tackles.

A New Steelers Field for Kids
Steelers announce new community field and youth-recreation complex at Hazelwood Green; state-of-the art facility, to be developed by Tishman Speyer, will serve young people in Hazelwood and across the region.
Richard King Mellon Foundation awards $10 million for construction.
The Pittsburgh Steelers today announced an historic expansion of their longstanding commitment to local youth: A new, state-of-the-art community field and youth-recreation complex at Hazelwood Green.
The complex will be operated by the Steelers Charities and branded with the Steelers logo. Activities will include youth football; clinics with current and former Steelers players and coaches; boys and girls flag football; soccer games and clinics; and renovation of a 10,000 square-foot building on the site to enable indoor sports and recreation activities, so the site can be utilized year-round. As it grows, the complex also could include top-tier food and beverage concessions; and enhancements to the main field so that it also could be utilized for high-school sports.
Tishman Speyer, which was selected in 2022 by Almono Partners to serve as the master developer of the 178-acre Hazelwood Green site, will develop the youth sports and recreation complex on behalf of the Steelers. Construction will begin next year with a grand opening planned for 2025.
"We are excited to be part of this special project which will provide the young athletes of our region access to a state-of-the-art facility at Hazelwood Green," said Dan Rooney, Steelers Director of Business Development & Strategy. "Not only will the field be utilized for various clinics and games in the community, but the Steelers plan to use the field for community programming and player-led initiatives. It is a very exciting announcement, and we are appreciative of the efforts of so many people in the community to help make this a reality, in particular the Richard King Mellon Foundation and Tishman Speyer."
Tim Smith, Founder and CEO of Center of Life, a Hazelwood community-empowerment organization, said, "Center of Life (COL) is thrilled to welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Greater Hazelwood community. COL has partnered with the Steelers for several years, providing tickets for our families, students and staff to attend football games and engaging our students in the NFL's "My Cleats, My Cause" program. The players have volunteered and participated in our community events, filling bags with food for Thanksgiving meals, delivering turkeys to families, and helping students with homework. The Pittsburgh Steelers have been great community partners, but now they'll be partners in the community. "Here We Go!" Together!
The project is a collaboration of three generational, community-focused organizations: The Steelers; Tishman Speyer; and the Richard King Mellon Foundation.
The Steelers, one of the NFL's oldest franchises, were founded 90 years ago by Art Rooney Sr.; today the organization is led by his grandson, Art Rooney II. Tishman Speyer, an internationally admired developer focused on building vibrant communities, traces its roots back 125 years and is led by CEO Rob Speyer. And the Richard King Mellon Foundation is Pittsburgh's largest philanthropy and one of the 50 largest in the world; the foundation was founded 76 years ago and today is led by Richard King Mellon's grandchildren.
The new Steelers field is centered on a shared belief between the three organizations in the central importance of sports and recreation in youth development, and a shared commitment to assure that such opportunities are available to all. The project is meant to decisively address a well-documented shortage of youth-centric sports and recreation destinations in the City of Pittsburgh.
The complex will be built in the section of Hazelwood Green most easily accessible to the Hazelwood community. It will serve youth from Hazelwood and across the Pittsburgh region.
"The Steelers organization has a long history of giving back to their community of fans," said Sonya Tilghman, executive director of Hazelwood Initiative, Inc. "It's exciting that they want Hazelwood to be their home. But, not only will this facility provide a place for Steelers-sponsored programs and events -- the facility will be a resource for community organization's programming as well. This facility will be a great addition to our community, and we're looking forward to having the Steelers as our neighbors!"
The Richard King Mellon Foundation has awarded a $10 million grant to Steelers Charities, the team's charitable arm, to fund construction of the new community field.
"Our Board approved this funding because this historic project advances so many of the Foundation's philanthropic priorities," said Sam Reiman, Director of the Foundation. "This new community field will become a destination to advance the health and well-being and future economic mobility of youth in Hazelwood and across our region. It will spur economic development in Hazelwood and all of Pittsburgh. And it is yet another compelling demonstration of the unique potential of Hazelwood Green to attract nationally respected organizations to work together to create a new model of community and economic development to benefit the people of Hazelwood and our region."
As master developer of Hazelwood Green, Tishman Speyer will draw upon its experience and expertise managing similar community-focused partnerships with the New York Yankees, San Francisco Giants, and Harvard University. In addition to its partnership with Steelers Charities and the Foundation, Tishman Speyer is working with Carnegie Mellon University on the new Robotics Innovation Center and the University of Pittsburgh on a new biomanufacturing center at Hazelwood Green, the BioForge.
"A key objective of this historic redevelopment is to harness the energy and dedication of Pittsburgh's most beloved institutions to enrich the neighborhoods surrounding Hazelwood Green," said Tishman Speyer CEO Rob Speyer. "The Steelers' field and youth recreation complex embodies that commitment and will give back to the community, the city and its families for decades to come."
The field will be located at the site's southeast entrance on Hazelwood Avenue between Gloster Street and Tecumseh Street.
Hazelwood Green is directly across the Monongahela River from the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, the Steelers' Southside training complex and offices.
"I want to thank the Pittsburgh Steelers, Richard King Mellon Foundation, Tishman Speyer, and Almono for coming together in partnership to create a safe place for our kids to learn and play," said Mayor Ed Gainey. "These types of partnerships are what make Pittsburgh great, and I'm excited to see just how big of an impact this investment will have on the community of Hazelwood. This field will help children across the city and provide opportunities for them to learn and have a healthy future."
"There is huge demand for additional playing fields in the City of Pittsburgh," said Barbara Warwick, District 5 City Council Member. "And youth football is particularly important here in Hazelwood. I'm really excited to see the Steelers, Tishman Speyer, and the Richard King Mellon Foundation coming together to bring this much-needed asset to the community."
"Congratulations to the Hazelwood Green team for the partnership with the Steelers to build a community field," said Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. "Thank you to the Steelers, Tishman Speyer and RK Mellon for your commitment to Hazelwood. We are fortunate to have such partners in this region."

Steelers Nation Unite
Luck of the Irish is with McCormack
Steelers.com
When former Irish footballer Stephanie Roche stopped by to visit Tom McCormack in Dublin, Ireland, McCormack thought she was there to talk about his love of the Steelers ahead of the team's regular season game in Ireland this season.
McCormack was decked out in his Cameron Heyward jersey, complete with the Walter Payton Man of the Year patch, and his Steelers gear was on display throughout the house to show off his passion for the black and gold.
But her visit was for something far more exciting.
She was there to surprise McCormack and share the news that he is the Steelers 2024 International Fan of the Year.
Roche pulled out her phone to share a message from Dan Rooney, the Steelers Director of Business Development and Strategy.
"I'm sending you this message to let you know that you have been selected as the Steelers International Fan of the Year," shared Rooney. "It's a well-deserved honor for a member of Steelers Nation who has been supporting the team from Dublin for many years."
Rooney then added another surprise when he let McCormack know that as a part of winning the honor, he would be joining the other 31 nominees, one from every team, at the 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where the Ultimate NFL International Fan of the Year will be announced.
"Thanks again for your support," Rooney continued. "Here we go."
A visibly shaken and surprised McCormack stared at the phone, simply uttering in a quiet voice, 'Here we go, Dan.'
He was then presented with a customized jersey touting him as team's International Fan of the Year, and all he could utter was, 'Oh my God. Wow. Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Steelers. Here we go.'

Not long after the news broke that he won the award, McCormack said his phone was buzzing away with congratulatory texts and messages from friends and family.
And he laughed when asked about his initial reaction.
"Having an Irishman with very few words is unusual," laughed McCormack. "But I was stumped. Absolutely ambushed.
"I was absolutely speechless. I got pretty emotional. I have been to the Steelers watch parties they have hosted here in Dublin. But I didn't expect this.
"I love the game. I love the Steelers. I love the city. I just want to bring more people here to see the Steelers."
McCormick is still pinching himself over receiving the honor, as well as the fact that the Steelers will be playing a regular season game at Croke Park in Dublin this season, something the NFL announced earlier this month.
The Steelers were granted rights to the island of Ireland through the NFL's Global Market Program in 2023 and since then have hosted a number of events across the island, including watch parties involving former players and youth football camps with current and former players there.
McCormack attended a preseason game the Steelers played against the Chicago Bears in 1997 at Croke Park as well, but this time it will be different.
"It's surreal," said McCormack. "When they were here in 1997, it was incredible. So, to actually see them for a regular game is just fantastic. To have them come here for a game where there is so much at stake is amazing. It's incredible."
McCormack was introduced to the NFL and Steelers when he made a trip with his University College Dublin rugby team in 1979. He also had family connections to the Pittsburgh area, so it just appeared that everything was right for him to become a Steelers fan.
"In 1979, our freshman rugby team went to Florida to do a six-game tour," recalled McCormack. "That was the first time a lot of us had actually seen American football. Obviously in rugby you can't pass forward where in American football it's the opposite, you can pass the ball forward with pinpoint accuracy and scientific algorithms and everything that goes with it.
"So, a lot of us were fascinated with it. I played out-half and fullback, so that would be an equivalent to quarterback and running back. I enjoyed where the gaps remained, where the blocks were, where people crisscrossed for interceptions and things like that. So completely different than rugby which in those days you kicked for possession. Dan Rooney Sr. even said it would be a great game if you didn't keep kicking the ball out.
"So, my love for American football started then. The Steelers were heading towards the Super Bowl in January of 1980. Whatever we could get or see on television, or through American Forces Radio, or even the beginning of magazines, it was pretty scant the coverage in those days. No internet. Not even a mobile phone.
"It was great to watch Franco Harris run in for a couple. Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, the grace of them catching the ball was just fantastic and in traffic, contested plays as well. All of it masterminded by Terry Bradshaw. I didn't see the first two Super Bowls they won, but I managed to buy the NFL VHS tapes, those big chunky tapes.
"I loved the crossover and the ability to beat a guy with pace and strength. A lot of that correlates to rugby. But the difference with the pads, equipment and technology, I had a voracious appetite to see it.
"At the time, my high school, St. Michael's College was run by the same priests that ran Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. Sometimes the priests would go there on ministry. Pittsburgh was always in our heads with priests coming and going. They would talk about their time there, and they would be talking about the football from there. I left high school in 1978, so they'd be talking about the first two Super Bowl wins and things like that. So, the seeds were planted."
It also didn't hurt that the Rooney family had such deep connections to Ireland, including a relationship McCormack was able to form though his work with a PR & Communications firm that helped with the growth and development of the Ireland Funds, which was started by Dan Rooney Sr. and Tony O'Reilly, the CEO of Heinz USA.
"What is particularly special to me is their relationship with the Rooney family," said McCormack. "I moved from high school teaching, into public relations, and I worked with Tony O'Reilly. Him and Dan Rooney worked to develop the Ireland Funds. So, I worked on promoting the black-tie dinners and other events and where the money went to promote peace. Dan Rooney was a peace maker. He also mentored me on football. The way Dan Rooney prioritized inclusivity, later the Rooney Rule was born out of."
It was football that it was all about in the end.
"I loved the power football, precision football," said McCormack. "It's one of the most widely supported teams because of the brand of football they play. Tough defense. Good running backs. Swann, Stallworth and later Hines Ward, the catches they made. Santonio Holmes, I met here in Dublin. I will never forget that Super Bowl game. They played great football.
"The qualities and ethic of what they are on and off the field is what swayed it for me. And the contact and mentorship of Dan Rooney, that meant there would never be another team for me."
While following the Steelers from overseas was tough in the 1980s, modern technology has made it much easier to connect with the team and not miss a minute of news. He has helped with the team's annual World Photo Day, gathering people in Ireland for group photos showing their love of the team.
He loves the opportunity to purchase items from the Steelers Pro Shop, as well as from Kiya Tomlin's shop, whether it's on a trip to the states or ordering online. He has 11 jerseys, with his new International Fan of the Year one a definite instant favorite. Photos and autographed items, including some from Willie Parker, James Farrior, Alan Faneca and Holmes, who have all visited Dublin as part of the Steelers outreach programs there.
But his number one item comes as no surprise.
"It's a photo of Dan Rooney and Bill Cowher holding up the Super Bowl trophy," said McCormack. "Dan Rooney signed it. That is the most treasured item."

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Nov. 10
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
ALDO GALVAN FROM TORREON, COAH, MEXICO: Why do the players leave the field at a different place from where they come out for the pregame introductions behind the end zone? ANSWER: Convenience. The pregame introductions are part of the GameDay entertainment experience at Acrisure Stadium, with the lights and the smoke and the music, and so using that tunnel is more conducive to the effect the team is trying to create for the fans and the networks. There is also an exit from the field behind the Steelers bench, and that leads to a more direct route to the locker room. That's why you'll see players and coaches exit that way following the game.
MARC SIMON FROM NAPLES, FL: This may be a naïve question, but why does the NFL have a trade deadline? And how is it chosen? ANSWER: It's based on competitive fairness. Without having a trading deadline, there would be nothing stopping a team from playing virtually the entire regular season and then making trades right on the cusp of the playoffs that could have a big influence on the outcome of those playoffs. Taking it to the extreme, there could be a flurry of moves right before the start of the postseason every year, and it would serve to cheapen the championships that are won. The trading deadline is set during the NFL Owners Meetings, and the procedure involves a proposal on establishing the date and then a vote of membership whether to enact that proposal. As a side note, the proposal to move the trading deadline back to where it currently is was made by the Steelers and subsequently approved by a vote of ownership.
VALERIE IVKOVICH FROM LIVINGSTON, NJ: How is the schedule made for our team and how far in advance is it made? ANSWER: According to the 2024 Official National Football Record & Fact Book, the bulk of each team's schedule has been determined from 2025-2030 in terms of opponents but not dates and times of the games. The formula used is a rotational system that involves having teams in a division play teams in other divisions within their conference as well as a rotational system of divisions playing divisions in the other conference. Also, each team's schedule includes two games each season against teams in its own conference based on the final standings from the previous season. That's to ensure that the best teams are always playing the best teams, and the weaker teams face each other. The following is a breakdown of the Steelers schedules for 2025-30; not included are the home-and-home series against division opponents and the games to be determined by the previous season's standings, obviously because those standings have not yet been determined:
• 2025: HOME: Buffalo, Green Bay, Minnesota, Miami; AWAY: Chicago, Detroit, New England; N.Y. Jets • 2026: HOME: Atlanta, Carolina, Houston Indianapolis; AWAY: Jacksonville, New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Tennessee • 2027: HOME: Denver, Las Vegas, LA Rams, Seattle; AWAY: Arizona, Kansas City, LA Chargers, San Francisco •2028: HOME: New England, N.Y. Jets, Philadelphia, Washington; AWAY: Buffalo, Dallas, Miami, N.Y. Giants • 2029: HOME: Chicago, Detroit, Jacksonville, Tennessee; AWAY: Green Bay, Houston, Indianapolis, Minnesota • 2030: HOME: Kansas City, LA Chargers, New Orleans, Tampa Bay; AWAY: Atlanta, Carolina, Denver, Las Vegas
BOB APJOK FROM KNOXVILLE, TN: I see offensive linemen moving a lot after going to the line of scrimmage. Hands pointing, heads moving around and even raising up and down. Then all of a sudden a flag comes in because someone twitched or leaned backwards. I am confused as to what really constitutes an illegal procedure penalty? ANSWER: Some of the movement you describe is permitted to allow teams to operate on a silent count in order to inject an amount of fairness for a visiting team forced to operate in a hostile environment. Or in the case of a Steelers game on the road, to allow the home team to operate on a silent count because of all the Steelers fans in attendance. After that, it often comes down to a judgment of the on-field officials as to whether the offense committed a false start or whether the opposing team made some kind of movement that induced that false start. The bottom line is that I'm often as confused as you are.
PATRICK BRIGHT FROM RAMA CAIDA, MENDOZA, ARGENTINA: I noticed the right tackle for Kansas City (Jawaan Taylor) getting huge starts backwards before the snap of the ball without any penalty being called. Why is this sanctioned by the league? It seems blatant. ANSWER: It is blatant, and it often is not called. And to me it seems as though it's often not called regularly against the Kansas City Chiefs.
ROD KEEFER FROM EDMOND, OK: With Mike Williams and Preston Smith joining the Steelers before their previous teams' bye weeks, will they be eligible to play in 18 regular season games this season? ANSWER: Yes.
CHARLES WAGNER FROM LANCASTER, PA: How do broadcast networks decide which Sunday afternoon NFL games are protected in their schedule that prevent flexing of those games to prime time, currently Sunday night, but soon also Monday night and Thursday night? ANSWER: It all has to do with networks looking to keep the games they believe will generate the most interest and the highest ratings to themselves. The "protecting games" feature is negotiated into the contracts the networks have with the NFL, and those are big-money contracts. And when it comes to protecting a game from being flexed, a particular network would get to do it to one game on a particular weekend. It's not a blanket situation.
MARK RICE FROM LAS VEGAS, NV: When an NFL team travels to road games, does the team foot the entire bill for the duration of the stay (excluding personal purchases)? Also do the players get a certain amount of free home and away tickets for family and friends? ANSWER: All travel expenses are paid by the team, and all players receive a per diem based on the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. That per diem can be spent or kept by the individual. Also, the CBA mandates a specific allotment of tickets for each home game for every player. Tickets for games on the road are not included in that provision.
PATRICK WEESE FROM CINCINNATI, OH: In your experience with the Steelers do you see wide receiver's tendencies to be divas higher now than in the past? It seems so common now, and I don't remember Louis Lipps, John Stallworth, or Hines Ward (for example) needing so much attention. ANSWER: This is a generational issue, not one that's unique to the Steelers. Players in the 1970s and 1980s were different than players today, both in their personal and professional lives. Across the board. And those differences reflect the differences in society during those respective eras as well.
MILTON MANION SR. FROM LOUISVILLE, KY: Can (or) will Dylan Cook take the place of Broderick Jones on the offensive line? ANSWER: He will not. Nor should he.
KEN MAULDIN FROM CLYDE, TX: Do teams get to talk to the players before they trade for them? Is that allowed? ANSWER: Only in cases where the player's original team has allowed that player to seek a trade. Otherwise, that would be tampering, which is punishable by the NFL if proven.

Labriola on the loss to the Eagles
Steelers.com
Never this season has it been more important for the Steelers to adhere strictly to the 24-hour rule. That's the rule where teams are allowed just 24 hours to celebrate or mourn the just completed game before turning their attention to the next one. Because of where they are in their schedule and what they have immediately in front of them, what happened in Philadelphia is of no consequence.
The 27-13 loss to the Eagles dropped the Steelers to 10-4, but they still have a 1-game lead in the AFC North, and because Miami and Indianapolis both lost on Sunday, they clinched a playoff spot in the AFC. But because they have that 1-game lead in the division, the Steelers can clinch the AFC North with a win in Baltimore.
As a division champion, the Steelers will get hats and T-shirts to commemorate the accomplishment, which will be nice to wear for about as long as it takes them to get home. But also as a division champion they earn a more favorable seeding into the postseason that for them will begin with a home playoff game in the Wild Card Round against an opponent other than the Chiefs or the Bills.
And since seeding determines the opponent, and with better seeding going to the division champions, beating the Ravens is a step along the way toward changing how they'll be labeled from "getting into the playoffs" to "winning in the playoffs."
"We've got to learn from it," said Cam Heyward. "We're not afforded a lot of time. We've got to have a memory like a goldfish. We've got to move on. Not to say we don't respect who we just played. The clock is ticking. Guys have got to get right. We've got to learn from our mistakes and move on."
The mistakes that cost them in Philadelphia are mistakes they have made earlier in this regular season, and while that can be disappointing and frustrating at the same time, it's necessary to factor in the degree of difficult. The reality is that the Eagles currently are one of the two best teams in the NFL, and after Buffalo hung up 197 rushing yards, 559 total net yards, and 48 points that included 6 touchdowns on the previously 12-1 Lions in Detroit, they have an argument as the best team in the NFL. Right now, anyway.
Chuck Noll was fond of answering either/or questions from the media with versions of the following: "That's like asking, 'How would you rather die? In a fire or by drowning?'" That's what the Eagles offer their opponents with an offense that contains 1,600-yard rusher Saquon Barkley and his 11 touchdowns along with receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith who came to the party with 1,389 yards receiving and 9 touchdowns. Which element deserves more of a defense's resources and attention? How do you want to die?
The Steelers did a better-than-decent job with Barkley, who finished the game with 65 yards rushing on 19 attempts (3.6 average) and no touchdowns to go along with an innocuous 9 yards receiving. And besides a 22-yard run, Barkley was as quiet as he had been in any game this season.
But Jalen Hurts was efficient, accurate, and careful with the football, and behind an offensive line that is talented, physical, experienced, and savvy with "hand usage," Brown and Smith were a two-headed ticking time bomb. They combined for 5 plays of between 20-22 yards but nothing longer than that, and each receiver got into the end zone once. All in all, not a disastrous outcome.
Which brings us back to a topic that's been a prickly theme throughout this season – the necessity of having an offense that score in the 30s. Consistently. Or at least having an offense that's able to push the number close enough to 30 so that the opponent isn't able to get comfortable and go low-risk for hunks of the game, both offensively and defensively.
On back-to-back possessions in the first quarter, the offense was set up by takeaways – one coming from special teams when Mark Robinson forced a fumble on a punt return and Nick Herbig recovered it, and the other coming from the defense when T.J. Watt punched the ball out of Hurts' hands and Beanie Bishop recovered it. All the Steelers got from those was a 37-yard field goal by Chris Boswell.
The first half ended with the Steelers having 7 possessions and being plus-2 in turnover ratio, but the offense had only 80 total net yards and 1 touchdown (13 points total thanks to a 49-yard field goal with 37 seconds left in the second quarter).
The touchdown came on a sweet catch in traffic by Pat Freiermuth in the end zone, but just one of those never is going to be enough to beat a team as loaded as the Eagles. The Steelers being unable to take advantage of their circumstances early in the game let them off the hook.
Then this is what happens when you let a team on a 9-game winning streak that's playing at home off the hook: Taking the second half kickoff, the Eagles went on a 13-play drive that ate 7 minutes off the game clock and ended with a field goal that upped their lead to 20-13, and then after the Steelers' turned the ball over on a Najee Harris fumble on a first-and-10 from the Philadelphia 26-yard line 4 plays later, the Eagles drove 74 yards in 13 plays and ate up another 6:33 off the clock with Hurts' 1-yard tush-push making it 27-13 two plays into the fourth quarter.
Ballgame.
By the time their charter flight crossed the Commonwealth and landed in Pittsburgh, it was Monday. Four days after that they're scheduled to board another flight that will take them to Baltimore for their most important game of the season.
"There's bigger fish to fry," said Heyward. "We're not just trying to squeeze into the playoffs. It's nice to know that we don't have to wait until Week 18 to figure out if we're in the playoffs or not. We have a playoff team. We've known that before this game. We played a quality playoff opponent. We didn't have our best showing, but there's a lot of ball in front of us. We've got AFC North championship ball in front of us. We have a chance to play an MVP caliber team with Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry. And with this quick turnaround, it's not circling the wagons. It's let's get it together because we've got to get going. Not a lot of time is afforded to us."
Not a lot of time that is best spent on tomorrow instead of wasting it by bemoaning yesterday. Because face it, they were going to have to beat the Ravens in Baltimore regardless of what they did in Philadelphia.

Goodell highlights Steelers involvement in NFL growth
Contributing Writer/Editor
As an ambassador of the game, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is extremely in tune with continuing to grow professional football in all avenues.
In recent years, that's included additional expansion of both NFL games and marketing rights through the Global Markets Program, along with the expansion of girls flag football programs here in the United States.
Goodell was in attendance at the Steelers' game at Acrisure Stadium Monday night against the New York Giants and said the franchise has played and will continue to play a big role in the NFL's long-term plans, both internationally and here in the United States.
"The Steelers are one of our more capital franchises on a global basis," Goodell said. "We were just talking earlier about our fans in Mexico. The Steelers are one and two with the Cowboys. Obviously in Ireland, they've got an easy draw because the Ambassador (former Steelers president and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, Dan Rooney) was impactful because of their history.
"But as a successful franchise over the years and decades, they have a tremendous following, and again, they're willing to participate in that. I think that's going to grow the game."
The Steelers currently have international rights through the Global Markets Program in Mexico, the island of Ireland and Germany. The Global Market Program gives NFL teams the opportunity to build brand awareness beyond the United States through fan engagement programs, events and commercial opportunities.
The Steelers, along with the Philadelphia Eagles and NFL Foundation among other organizations, and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania also have been at the forefront of creating opportunities for girls to participate in the sport through flag football.
The Steelers and Eagles have fostered a flag football league for girls the past three years, leading the PIAA, the governing body for interscholastic sports in Pennsylvania, to approve girls flag football to be an officially sanctioned sport for the 2025-26 school year.
Pennsylvania currently has over 100 girls flag football teams at schools across the state.
"I think it's a great development, because one of the biggest issues for us is to share the game with young women and for them to understand the same values in football, where it's teamwork," said Goodell. "It's the values that come from playing the game they share. And I've seen it with young women around the world.
"They're empowered by it, they're really excited to be able to participate in this work they couldn't do before. And it gives them a confidence that as a dad of two girls I'm really proud of so I think it's going to be a huge hit."
A huge hit for Goodell was his visit to the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum earlier in the day before the game kicked off.
Goodell spent plenty of time touring the museum, located at Acrisure Stadium, which is now in its third year of existence.
It was fun for Goodell because he spent a good amount of time in the Pittsburgh area as an undergraduate at Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., from where he graduated in 1981.
"I loved it. We could have probably spent another hour down there," Goodell said. "It was fun for me because, I've got a little bit of a history here and sort of seeing Steeler football since the late '70s here in Pittsburgh, it's hard not to be a fan here and see the impact it's had on this community, how the Rooney family has brought this game, this community together around an institution that I think no other team or no other league, no other institution, can bring this community together like this deal."
That bond the Steelers have with the region is a big reason why the NFL chose to hold the NFL Draft here in Pittsburgh in 2026.
Goodell said he is looking forward to showcasing Pittsburgh to the world and bringing fans of the NFL to the city and region.
"There will be an obvious economic impact, which is extraordinarily significant," Goodell said. "The latest estimates are well over $200 million. I always say the value of that is another chance to show off all the great things that are happening in this community, the work that's going on with the governor and the county and the city.
"We hope to be able to highlight the impact of that and what's happening in our communities. I think the money generated from the draft will go back into the community, but I also believe the money generated by the Steelers here goes back into this community, which is unique to our model professional support. That money is created in some way, by other markets and brought into this community, and I think that's where the true economic impact happens. But as I say, the platform of the draft is more important than the context.
"The number of people watching will be 50 million on a global basis. That's a chance to show off this community."

Training Camp Report: Aug. 3
Steelers.com
LATROBE, Pa. – Signing an unrestricted free agent punter doesn't move the needle in the same way as when a team adds an all-situations inside linebacker, or a starting quarterback with a Super Bowl win on his resume. But getting Cameron Johnston via a 3-year, $9 million deal that included a $2.875 million signing bonus to replace Pressley Harvin III has been looking very significant in its own right.
During the 2023 season with Harvin as the punter, the Steelers ranked 30th in the NFL in average per punt. Individually, Harvin ranked 31st in the NFL in gross average and 29th in net average. By comparison, Johnston, who punted for the Houston Texans from 2021-23, was 15th in the NFL with a 47.7-yard gross average and 4th in the league with a 44.0-yard net average.
During Saturday's practice at Saint Vincent College, Johnston put on a show with a series of punts that were long, high, and well-placed. During the special teams period devoted to punting, Johnston launched several punts that traveled more than 60 yards and were placed within 5 yards of the sideline.
It might seem incongruous to be highlighting a punting exhibition during a practice that came less 24 hours after the Steelers engaged in a two-hour version of rock-em sock-em robots at Latrobe Stadium during Friday Night Lights, but Coach Mike Tomlin explained the reasoning.
"A really productive day today," said Tomlin. "The guys gave it all to us last night. It's our intention is to work hard in this environment, but also work smart. And so we did some things to help them with the bounce-back. We had several periods on a short field, for example, which was an effort to gain their legs back. We had some guys who are veteran players, and we minimized them today in response to last night. It's just appropriate. They gave us a lot (Friday night), and that's a component of this process.
"They gotta go hard, and we've got to make good judgments as coaches. We've got to find ways to make every single day productive, but it's just productive on different levels. I liked the work that we got done today. We'll tee it up for tomorrow. Sunday will be a big day – short-yardage, goal-line, and you know the competition will be hot. We'll be right back at it."
7-SHOTS Also in the category of a bounce-back was the defense's performance in 7-Shots. After absorbing a 7-0 loss in Friday night's version, the defense erased an early 3-0 hole to bounce back for a 4-3 win in the drill.
Justin Fields staked the offense to a 3-0 lead, with a run for a touchdown followed by consecutive passes to George Pickens in the end zone on the next two plays. With a chance to clinch the drill with an 11th straight touchdown, Fields had his pass batted down at the line of scrimmage, and it appeared that either Isaiahh Loudermilk or Montravius Adams made the play.
Kyle Allen came onto the field and threw an interception to Thomas Graham Jr. in the middle of the field; then rolled far to his right before attempting unsuccessfully to throw all the way back to the left side of the end zone for Darnell Washington; and then he was "sacked" by DeMarvin Leal to give the defense the win.
NOTES Beanie Bishop had the other interception for the defense when he anticipated a quick throw to the receiver he was covering, fired into the backfield and made the catch. Bishop then maintained his balance and raced untouched for what would've been a pick-six.
TOMLIN'S INJURY UPDATE "The great thing today is we had no additional negativity from a health standpoint, and really things are status quo with the guys on that list."
Sunday's practice at Saint Vincent College is scheduled to begin at 1:55 p.m.

Labriola on the win over Washington
Steelers.com
This was why.
Why you added him to the roster two years after spending a No. 1 pick on the position. Why you were overly patient and extra cautious with what was supposed to be a minor injury even as the clock was ticking on the start of the regular season. Why you never gave up on the notion of him, even as his young, talented backup was winning games while he watched. Why it was the right thing to do to put him in the lineup and give him a chance even as so many questioned, criticized, or even mocked the decision. Why the risk was worth it.
It has been three weeks since Coach Mike Tomlin inserted Russell Wilson into the lineup to do the job he was brought to Pittsburgh to do all along, but it wasn't until Sunday against Washington that the timing and the rationale behind the decision came into sharp focus.
Coming off their bye week, the Steelers were 2-0 with Wilson and 6-2 overall going into a showdown vs. the best opponent to this point on its schedule, a schedule that by the way only will get more difficult moving forward. In winning those first two with Wilson at quarterback, the Steelers handled teams with losing records in front of a home crowd. They used some flashy special teams, a battering ram of a running game, and some dynamic plays from their defense, and Wilson played pretty well, too.
The Commanders posed a much greater degree of difficulty for the very simple reason that they were more talented and better coached and had the confidence that comes from winning 7 of their previous 8 games.
And as Sunday's exercise unfolded, the Commanders made some plays, took advantage when the Steelers presented some opportunities, and generally stood toe-to-toe and traded punches. The wind was tricky and required some adjustment. In other words, the Steelers found themselves in a test of wills that was going to last the entire four quarters.
Whether the decision to fake a punt on fourth-and-15 from their own 16-yard line with a 7-0 lead in the first quarter was rashly aggressive or a perfectly timed gamble that became a disaster only after a pass was dropped that was accurate enough and long enough to get the first down is arguable. The defense can be judged on the 5 three-and-outs it inflicted or on the touchdown drive that started at the Washington 4-yard line and included 3 third-down conversions and a facemask penalty that wiped out a sack. And while the offense had gotten the ball into the end zone twice, it still had to punt 5 times in the first half and its only "chunk plays" were a 12-yard run and a 16-yard circus catch.
Assigning blame is an inevitable part of professional sports and everything that happened on Sunday will be blogged and podcasted and graded and rated to death, but none of that really mattered on the floor of Northwest Stadium. The opportunity that each game presents to a team during an NFL regular season is precious, and the ability to manipulate the outcome in your favor is what pays the bills in this business.
And the people experienced in the ways of the NFL realize that the outcome of as few as a half-dozen plays can be the difference between seizing or squandering each of those 17 opportunities.
What's also true is the player on each team most capable of impacting those half-dozen plays, good or bad, is the quarterback. He doesn't have to be good all of the time, but it sure helps if he can be special a few times. Russell Wilson was special in some of those moments against the Commanders, and because of that the Steelers left town with a 28-27 victory that raised their record to 7-2.
Wilson was special on a day when things were not necessarily going according to plan for him. He would finish the game having completed 50 percent of his passes for less than 200 yards, being sacked three times and intercepted once.
The receiver had first put on the uniform four days earlier in coming over in a trade from the Jets, and he was in the game against Washington only as an injury-replacement. He had never repped the play in practice and didn't know what to do on it. But it was third-and-9 from the Washington 32-yard line, there was 2:27 left, and they were losing by 6. It had to be now. Mike Williams said Wilson told him where to line up and what route to run, and then it became a matter of getting his head around for the perfectly timed/thrown ball and catching it. Touchdown. Big-time professional quarterbacking right there.
When the defense turned the ball over on downs near midfield with its own big-time play, the difference between winning or losing came down to protecting a 1-point lead. The Commanders dug in, and then the next thing you know it's fourth-and-1 with 1:02 left to play. Get the first down, and the game is over. Anything else would bring Jayden Daniels and the Washington offense back for another crack at a last-second field goal and a dramatic victory for the home team.
Wilson converted for the Steelers by using cadence as a weapon to create a neutral zone infraction. Five yards. First down. Victory formation.
"It's a good team win," said Tomlin. "When you're coming into an environment like this, and you find a way to get it done, not only is it a well-earned victory, but there's some real growth associated with it. Knowledge of self, individually and collectively, is a component of this thing as we push through this journey. We learned a little bit about ourselves, hopefully in a positive way today."
One of the things they learned was that against a good team on the road, they had a quarterback capable of delivering in the big-time clutch situations that all winning teams in the NFL must have, what the Steelers haven't had since Ben Roethlisberger was plying his trade, what they absolutely have to have for the rest of 2024.
They're going to absolutely have to have it because all that being 7-2 in mid-November earns is the attention of every remaining team on the schedule, and as we've already established that schedule only gets tougher from here. One way or the other, they knew that facing down the barrel of that schedule was going to be necessary, and then how they fared along the way would be what defines them.
Next up is a visit from the Baltimore Ravens, and if history holds that one could make this one seem like a pillow fight. Games like this against Washington and then one against the Ravens a week later – and the situations within games like these that will end up determining the outcome – are why Russell Wilson is here. And that's why you did all of those other things leading up to this in the first place.
Big-time clutch quarterback play is that important.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 4
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
JOE RILEY FROM ROGERSVILLE, MO: Do you think there is any hope of the Pro Bowl being played as a four-quarter game again? ANSWER: There is a level of violence inherent when football is played, and with that comes some level of a threat of bodily harm, threat of injury. I don't believe you're ever going to be able to convince the best players in the NFL to participate in a meaningless game where they could sustain an injury that conceivably could shorten or end their careers. Football without hitting is bad television, and the Pro Bowl ratings were suffering as the game was evolving more towards what it is now, which is flag football. I cannot see it going back to that.
ELLEN CAUDLE FROM CHATTANOOGA, TN: Why doesn't the front office of the Pittsburgh Steelers listen to what the fans want? I know that they are the professionals, but some of their decisions just baffle the fans. They don't give a detailed reason for their decisions. ANSWER: I'm going to try to be as respectful as possible as I answer this, but what business on this planet – and every team in the NFL is a business – polls its customers before it's making decisions, or as it's making decisions? Take the store where you shop for groceries as an example. Would that store poll its customers before adding an item or discontinuing an item? Before setting its prices? Before deciding whether to be open for business on weekends? Involve its customers in its hiring and firing decisions? Imagine if the Steelers polled the fans before making every decision. Free agents to sign, and the amount of those contracts. Players to draft. Cutting the roster. Picking a starting quarterback. Deciding if/when to bench the starting quarterback. As a fan/customer, you have every right to vote at the cash register, and by that I mean the right to decide whether or not to spend your hard-earned money on the product. Beyond that, I'm sorry but fans don't deserve to be involved/polled in the franchise's decisions.
MARK RICE FROM LAS VEGAS, NV: If the Steelers are interested in re-signing Russell Wilson, or Justin Fields, what is taking this long to sign one of them? ANSWER: Taking so long? You're talking about contracts that will end up being multi-year, multi-million-dollar deals. Taking so long? Seriously? The Steelers have exclusive negotiating rights with all of its own players until the start of the legal tampering period, which is on March 10. Today is Feb. 4. Do you think the agents for those two players are going to take the first offer? If it was your agent, would you want that? Or maybe you think the Steelers should just start out with a ridiculously high number to get it over with so that you wouldn't think it was taking too long. To steal a line from John McEnroe: "You cannot be serious."
LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM. PA: How much is Russell Wilson set to make on the open market as an unrestricted free agent? I saw Justin Fields is around $6.4 million a year, but is Russell's age playing a factor on his next price tag? ANSWER: There are no such numbers for what Russell Wilson and/or Justin Fields are "set to make on the open market," at least no such numbers that have any basis in fact or reality. What you're reading are projections, estimations, which are synonyms for guesses. Stop wasting your time with that kind of garbage, because it's simply click-bait.
CHRIS BILLINGHURST FROM MAIDENHEAD, UK: Following up on Michael Williams' question last week regarding Super Bowl jerseys, it was my understanding that the AFC team gets the choice to wear their home uniform for even numbered Super Bowls, whereas the NFC gets the choice for the odd numbers. Do you know why the Steelers wore white jerseys in Superbowl XL, and black in Super Bowls X and XIII? ANSWER: The way it works is that one year the NFC is the designated home team in the Super Bowl and the following year the AFC is the designated home team in the Super Bowl. And it's the designated home team that gets to choose which color jersey to wear. In Super Bowl IX, the Vikings were the home team, and they chose to wear purple, and so the Steelers wore white. In Super Bowl X, the Steelers were the home team, and they chose to wear black. In Super Bowl XIII, the Cowboys were the designated home team, and since the Cowboys' preferred jersey color is white, they chose to wear white which left the Steelers in black. In Super Bowl XL, the Steelers were the designated home team, but they chose to wear their white (road) jerseys, because the team squeezed into the 2005 playoffs as the No. 6 seed, which meant they opened on the road vs. Cincinnati in the Wild Card Round, then advanced to Indianapolis in the Divisional Round, and then played the Broncos in Denver in the Conference Championship Round. In keeping with the theme of "road warriors," the Steelers chose to wear their white jerseys vs. Seattle in Super Bowl XL.
EVO HERNANDEZ FROM MEXICO CITY, MEXICO: Why do the Steelers select after the NFC South Division Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2025 NFL draft if the teams have the same record of 10-7? ANSWER: According to operations.nfl.com, "In situations where teams finished the previous season with identical records, the determination of draft position is decided by strength of schedule — the aggregate winning percentage of a team's opponents. The team that played the schedule with the lowest winning percentage will be awarded the higher pick." Because the Steelers played a tougher schedule than the Buccaneers, Tampa Bay picks ahead of Pittsburgh.
BILL MALONI FROM CHEVY CHASE, MD: I've seen various and conflicting accounts of when the Steelers draft in 2025. Beyond having the 21st overall selection in Round 1, how many picks do they have now? ANSWER: The Steelers have 7 picks in the 2025 NFL Draft. Those break down to 1 pick in each of the first 5 rounds, and then 2 picks in Round 7. Once compensatory draft picks are awarded, the draft slots in Rounds 3-through-7 will be assigned by the league.
JON SPROUL FROM PORT SAINT LUCIE, FL: With respect to the kickoff rule change, have any kickoffs been returned for touchdowns this past season? ANSWER: There were 7 kickoff returns for touchdowns during the 2025 regular season. The players who did it were Arizona's DeeJay Dallas, Cincinnati's Charlie Jones, the Jets' Kene Nwangwu, Seattle's Laviska Shenault Jr., the Giants' Ihmir Smith Marsette, Dallas' Juanyeh Thomas, and Dallas' KaVontae Turpin.
JED SMART FROM EUSTIS, FL: Another question about Pro Bowl pay. T.J. Watt was selected to this year's Pro Bowl, and for whatever reason, bowed out. I understand he's still credited with being selected, but does he, or others who get replaced, get paid for being selected? ANSWER: When it comes to the Pro Bowl, you have to play to get paid.
LEON KULINSKI FROM OIL CITY, PA: I read where guard James Daniels was very highly rated for his performances before he got hurt. As he is a young veteran I think the Steelers would benefit from bringing him back although everything I read seems to be that he will sign elsewhere. Would like your thoughts on this issue. ANSWER: James Daniels, who will be 28 in September, tore an Achilles on Sept. 30 in a game vs. the Colts in Indianapolis. I cannot imagine a realistic scenario in which he would be able to pass a physical when free agency begins on March 12, and so I have no idea what kind of market there might be for Daniels. Before the 2024 season even began, the Steelers had used a fourth-round draft pick on Mason McCormick with the idea that he would step in at guard once Daniels hit unrestricted free agency, and I see that as the most likely way this situation plays out.

Labriola On
Tomlin on officiating, Dean Pees, rushing Lamar
Steelers.com
Q. What did you learn about your team during last Sunday's game in Philadelphia and its immediate aftermath? A. You know, it's interesting because sometimes when you don't play as well as you'd like, or you don't coach as well as you'd like. I don't know that you learn new lessons. I think sometimes it just fortifies some things that you already believe in, whether it's you as a coach or you as an individual player. It's the minutia. It always is. It's the fundamental things. It's tackling, it's ball possession or ball security. It's capitalizing on moments, on short fields and situational ball. And I think that when looking back at it through that sober lens, it is affirmation of what we already know about how significant situational play is and how significant fundamental football is.
Q. What about learning things about your players, your team, how they respond to a performance like that? A. I think we're in the process of writing that story. I never look to the next practice. It's about the next opportunity, how you position yourself, how you rise up in those moments. And so, I don't know that I was looking for any "growth" in the process of preparing for this next one. I think those answers lie in the quality of our play and execution this time around.
Q. I'm not going to ask you to criticize the officiating, and I don't have enough money to help with the fine if you did, but do you address controversial calls with your players in-game if such things happen, if for no other reasons than to talk to them about overcoming things like that, to keep them focused on the game? A. Actually, we do that in team development. That's one of the reasons why it's so important to have NFL officials in our training camp-like settings. To me, when you're teaching those lessons on site, you're late. It's my job to see around corners. It's my job to prepare our team for circumstances such as that. The lessons are easily learned in non-competitive situations, and so you put them in those situations in team development. Sometimes you wrong them and force them to overcome it. It's not about being fair all the time in team development, but you do so with the purpose to educate. And that's the general tenor that we take and approach that we take regarding those things. If I'm teaching those lessons on site, I'm late.
Q. In reviewing the game vs. the Eagles, you talked about missed tackles and how that impacted the flow of the game. You did live tackling every day during training camp, and you're not going to do that now, and so how can you work on being better at that? A. The approach, the technique, the long stride/short stride to the point of confrontation, how square you are. The fundamental things. We do sled tackles, big pop-up dummy tackles. And so we do a lot of fundamental skill development around tackling that better positions us to be the functional tacklers that we need to be.
Q. In giving the injury report during your news conference, you said, "rest assured, the healthy people are going to play in this game." In December of a regular season, what does "healthy" mean? A. The guys who got a clean bill of health and are ready to go. And a clean bill of health is a slippery slope. But the guys who are healthy enough and ready to go, that's the point I was making more than anything. This time of year, particularly when you're facing 60 or 60-plus minutes of really competitive football, you better start with the healthiest of people. You start compromising health, you end up a quarter or two quarters into the game playing a man short or two or three men short. I've got to feel good about the potential of guys that we suit up being able to play start-to-finish.
Q. When we were talking about Russell Wilson back when he had his calf situation, you said he had to be medically cleared, and then you wanted to see him on the practice field doing the things that he needs to do to be effective. For things like a hamstring injury or a sprained ankle, is there some medical test that can be done that says, OK, this guy is now healthy? A. There are so many technological advancements that aid us in that decision-making. All of these guys have GPS monitors on them, and your ability to produce top speed, your ability to produce work output similar to what you produce when you were healthy is a great indicator of readiness. And so it's not only top speed, but it's speed endurance, it's workload. We have metrics now that really aid us and minimize some of the guesswork in terms of player health and availability around some of those things.
Q. So far this season, Calvin Austin III has 9 catches of 20-plus yards. What about him and his skill-set makes him effective as that kind of a wide receiver? A. He's both quick and fast, and so his quickness allows him to get releases at the line of scrimmage, and he has the type of long speed that allows them to create separation, whether it's across the field or down the field. And when you're quick and fast, usually you position yourself to have the type of stats that you outlined.
Q. Dean Pees was a linebackers coach and a defensive coordinator with the Ravens before he retired, and he was brought out of retirement in October during this season to be a special advisor to coordinator Zach Orr. What is different about the Ravens defense since Coach John Harbaugh brought Pees back? A. I just see some real fundamental Dean Pees things, like umbrella structure that minimizes the potential for big plays. Prior to our last game against Baltimore, the Ravens were 32nd in the league in pass defense, and they'd given up some big plays. And really it was outlined by some explosion plays, particularly in the Cincinnati Bengals games, with Ja'Marr Chase scoring 5 touchdowns in two games against them. When I look at their more recent tape, I really see the Dean Pees influence in terms of umbrella defense minimizing big plays. And I think the statistics since the last time we played them bear that out. Since the last time we played them, for example, they're No. 2 in the league in pass defense. You don't see it in totality, because it's tracked over the course of the full season, but since the last time we played them, they're second in the league, and what they've done is minimize big plays. And really, that's quintessential Dean Pees. Not only was he employed in Baltimore, as you mentioned, but more recently, he was a defensive coordinator for Arthur Smith in Atlanta as well. And I have a real familiarity with his work. Arthur has a real familiarity with his work, and what we're looking at more recently looks very similar to Dean Pees type work.
Q. I looked up the stats since the first Steelers-Ravens game. The Ravens have only given up one pass play of 20-or-more yards. You mentioned umbrella coverage. Can you detail what that means? A. They play what is referred to globally as Tampa-2 in a variety of forms. They'll play bogus Tampa-2, they'll play traditional Tampa-2, they'll zone exchange and play Tampa. All is done to make the quarterback diagnose post-snap, and while also at the same time, rerouting the potential of vertical receivers outside. And when you do those things, you really position yourself to minimize big plays. I grew up in that school of thought from my time as a position coach years ago down in Tampa, and I understand it in great detail.
Q. Odafe Oweh had 2.5 sacks and 4 quarterback hits in the first Steelers-Ravens game. Is he now their primary pass rusher? A. He's a talented young guy, but they've got a lot of guys who are really good in that area. They play a bunch of people. He's a guy who might be ascending or emerging from the group, certainly, but I think the strength of their pack from a pass rush standpoint is the pack itself. They play a lot of people and have all year.
Q. In the first meeting, Patrick Ricard played 22 snaps, and Derrick Henry had 13 carries. Do you expect those numbers to be higher today? A. It depends on whether or not they're winning possession downs. The last time around, we were winning possession downs, and that minimizes the totality of a lot of discussions. I'm sure it'll be their agenda for those numbers to be higher, but oftentimes your agenda and reality are dictated by your ability to win possession downs and thus produce additional downs or not.
Q. Does the venue have any impact on how much a team might want to run the ball? A. It does at times, particularly when you're working on a silent count the offense loses its ability to beat the defense to the punch. I believed and still do over the course of my career that legitimate dominant running games are weather proof or environment proof and defense proof. If you're really good at running the football, you run the football in all circumstances.
Q. What can your edge rush-men absolutely not do when putting pressure on Lamar Jackson? A. We can't have multiple people behind them. Those vertical holes turn a four-man rush into a three-man rush, or a four-man rush into a two-man rush. When you get vertical holes where he can step up and run horizontal to get back vertical, the athletic guys – and make no mistake, Lamar is a quintessential athletic guy – rushers behind him are negative. You've got to work to contain him, and a major component of containing him is keeping him inside and in front, and that vertical rush component ending up with guys behind him has been catastrophic for a lot of defenses trying to minimize Lamar Jackson.
Q. Would you go so far as to tell your pass-rushers, "Don't try any spin moves?" A. I don't put limits on our guys in that way, because then you quell their natural instincts and the skills that they have developed. But you do make them cognizant of certain major coaching points or bullet points, and so I talk more broadly. If we've got a four-man rush, we need to have four guys in front of him. If we have a five-man rush, we need to have five guys in front of him. Guys behind mobile quarterbacks really are the catalyst for a lot of issues for defenses. If a guy is immobile then you can circle him and end up behind him and retrace, but the mobile ones find those vertical escape lanes. And then it creates problems for you.
Q. What do you need to get from your team today, and specifically from starting quarterback Russell Wilson? A. From our team, we need to play hard and smart, and I can say the same thing about Russell Wilson. All the marbles are on the table, if you will. We're competing for the AFC North Championship, and that requires a certain mindset while at the same time we've got to be sharp. We've got to display awareness. We've got to play within the rules of the game. We can't allow emotions to get away from us. You know, the Baltimore Ravens are the most penalized team in the National Football League this season, and if that is them, we need to let that be them and not us. A component of us positioning ourselves to win is staying on schedule, not giving them free real estate. And whatever side of the ball you're on, that's what penalties do. You get offensive penalties that push you behind the chains, you're not going to win possession downs. You give them free real estate and chunks of ground, you're going to produce scoring drives on the other side. And that cannot be us.

From 12:00 p.m. ET on Monday, March 13 until 3:59:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 15, clubs are permitted to contact and enter into contract negotiations with the certified agents of players who will become unrestricted free agents upon expiration of their 2022 player contracts at 4:00 p.m. ET on March 15. The two-day negotiating period applies only to prospective unrestricted free agents. It does not apply to players who have received, or who may receive, a required tender applicable to the 2023 League Year (e.g., Exclusive Rights Players, Restricted Free Agents, Franchise Players or Transition Players).
Q. What are the categories of free agency? A. Players are either "restricted free agents" or "unrestricted free agents." A restricted free agent may be subject to a "qualifying offer." A restricted or unrestricted free agent may be designated by his prior club as its franchise player or transition player.
Q. What is the time period for free agency signings this year? A. For restricted free agents, from March 15 to April 21. For unrestricted free agents who have received a tender from their prior club by the Monday immediately following the final day of the NFL Draft for the 2023 League Year (i.e., May 1), from March 15 to July 24 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). For franchise players, from March 15 until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 14. For transition players, from March 15 until July 24. After July 24 and until 4 p.m. ET on the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 14, the prior club has exclusive negotiating rights to unrestricted free agents and transition players. If the above-listed players do not sign by November 14, they must sit out the season.
Q. What is the difference between a restricted free agent and an unrestricted free agent? A. In the 2023 league year, players with three accrued seasons who have received a qualifying offer become restricted free agents when their contracts expire at the conclusion of the 2022 league year on March 15. Unrestricted free agents have completed four or more accrued seasons. Upon expiration of his 2022 contract, an unrestricted free agent is free to sign with any club with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club.
Q. What constitutes an "accrued season"? A. Six or more regular season games on a club's active/inactive, reserve/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists.
Q. How do the free agency rules apply to restricted free agents? A. If a player with three accrued seasons has received a "qualifying offer" (a salary tender predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his old club, he can negotiate with any club through April 21. If the restricted free agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a "right of first refusal" on any offer sheet the player signs. If the old club does not match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the amount of its qualifying offer. If an offer sheet is not executed on or before April 21, the player's negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club. In addition, prior to the start of free agency a player who would otherwise be a restricted free agent may be designated by his old club as its franchise player or transition player.
Q. What are the right of first refusal/qualifying offer amounts for players who have completed three accrued seasons? A. For right of first refusal only, a one-year salary of at least $2,627,000.
For right of first refusal and compensation at the player's original draft round, a one-year salary of at least $2,743,000 or 110 percent of the 2022 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of one second-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $4,304,000 or 110 percent of the 2022 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of one first-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $6,005,000 or 110 percent of the 2022 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of only one first-round draft selection, but any provision in the new club's offer sheet waiving or limiting the new club's ability to designate the player as a franchise or transition player is not a principal term and need not be matched by the prior club, a one-year salary of at least $6,505,000 or 110 percent of the 2022 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
Q. What determines an unrestricted free agent? A. A player with four or more accrued seasons whose contract has expired. He is free to sign with any club, with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club, through July 24 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). At that point, his negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club if by May 1 the old club tendered the player a one-year contract for 110 percent of his prior year's salary. His old club then has until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season (November 14) to sign him. If he does not sign by that date, he must sit out the season. If no tender is offered by May 1, the player can be signed by any club at any time throughout the season.
Q. What determines a franchise player? A. The salary offer by a player's club determines what type of franchise player he is: exclusive or non-exclusive.
An "exclusive" franchise player – not free to sign with another club – is offered the greater of (i) the average of the top five salaries at the player's position for the current year as of the end of the restricted free agent signing period on April 21; or (ii) the amount of the required tender for a non-exclusive franchise player, as explained below. Article 10, Section 2(a)(i) of the CBA sets forth the methodology, known as the "Cap Percentage Average," for calculating the required tender for a non-exclusive franchise player: The Nonexclusive Franchise Tender shall be a one year NFL Player Contract for (A) the average of the five largest Prior Year Salaries for players at the position . . . at which the Franchise Player participated in the most plays during the prior League Year, which average shall be calculated by: (1) summing the amounts of the Franchise Tags for players at that position for the five preceding League Years; (2) dividing the resulting amount by the sum of the Salary Caps for the five preceding League Years . . . ; and (3) multiplying the resulting percentage by the Salary Cap for the upcoming League Year . . . (the "Cap Percentage Average") . . . ; or (B) 120% of his Prior Year Salary, whichever is greater . . . .
If a club extends a required tender to a "non-exclusive" franchise player pursuant to this section, the player shall be permitted to negotiate a player contract with any club, except that draft-choice compensation of two first-round draft selections shall be made in the event he signs with a new club.
Q. How many franchise players and transition players can a team designate each season? A. A club can designate one franchise player or one transition player among its potential restricted or unrestricted free agents.
Q. Can a club decide to withdraw its franchise or transition designation on a player? A. Yes. A club can withdraw its franchise or transition designation, and the player then automatically becomes an unrestricted free agent, either immediately if the tender is withdrawn after the start of the 2023 league year, or when his 2022 contract expires if the tender is withdrawn before the start of the 2023 league year.
Q. What is the salary cap for 2023? A. The salary cap is $224,800,000 per club.
Q. When must teams be in compliance with the salary cap? A. At the start of the 2023 league year, which begins at 4:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 15.
Q. If a team is under the salary cap at the end of a given season, can the team "carry over" room to the next season? A. Yes. A team may carry over room from one league year to the following league year by submitting notice to the NFL prior to 4:00 p.m. ET on the day following the team's final regular-season game, indicating the amount of room that the club wishes to carry over.
Q. What is the maximum amount of room that a club can carry over? A. A club can carry over 100 percent of its remaining 2022 room to its adjusted salary cap for 2023.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Nov. 28
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
TIM GAREY FROM PORTLAND, OR: What's the status of Troy Fautanu and Roman Wilson? I haven't heard much lately. ANSWER: Both Troy Fautanu and Roman Wilson are on the injured reserve list. When players are on injured reserve there is nothing to hear until they are designated to return and then begin to practice. There are not periodic updates on the progress of their rehabilitation, because it's not required by the NFL, and that's a procedure adhered to by all teams. The next time you hear anything about Fautanu or Wilson in any official capacity will be if the Steelers designate either to return and they resume practicing with the rest of the team. As an example, Montravius Adams was placed on the injured reserve list on Oct. 22, and on Nov. 27 it was announced he was placed on injured reserve/designated to return and began practicing. That's the way it works for players once they're placed on injured reserve.
TOM HERNANDEZ FROM BAYAMON, PR: Is there any web site where I could find the Steelers' fourth-down conversions by week? I think that as the season is progressing the team is getting less effective in converting fourth downs while the Steelers have been less effective with their fourth-down defense. ANSWER: I did the work for you by going through each game, and I believe you are confusing a bad performance against the Browns as a reflection of a trend during the season to this point.
Against Atlanta, the Steelers were 0-for-1 on fourth down, and the Falcons were 1-for-1. Against Denver, the Steelers were 0-for-0 on fourth down, and the Broncos were 1-for-2. Against the Chargers, neither team attempted a fourth down. Against, Indianapolis, the Steelers were 0-for-2 on fourth down, and the Colts were 0-for-0. Against Las Vegas, the Steelers were 1-for-1 on fourth down, and the Raiders were 1-for-3. Against the Jets, the Steelers were 2-for-2 on fourth down, and the Jets were 1-for-2. Against the Giants, the Steelers were 0-for-0 on third down, and the Giants were 1-for-1. Against Washington, the Steelers were 1-for-2 on fourth down, and the Commanders were 0-for-1. Against Baltimore, the Steelers were 0-for-1 on fourth down, and the Ravens were 0-for-0. Against Cleveland, the Steelers were 1-for-3 on fourth down, and the Browns were 4-for-4.
RICH DECIUS FROM SHELBY, OH: Offenses will sling the ball down the sideline to a receiver in hopes of a catch or a pass interference penalty, and we've seen many ticky-tacky pass interference calls. Are the rules different on Hail Mary play? ANSWER: The rules for pass interference are the same, whether it's a slant pass on the first play of the game, or a Hail Mary on the final play of the game.
HAL TROLLER FROM ROCKY MOUNT, VA: When Browns CB Greg Newsome blocked George Pickens right out of the back of the end zone in the Cleveland game, wouldn't that be pass interference? Pickens should be allowed to make a play on the ball as a receiver right? ANSWER: I should think so.
KEITH A. WIMER FROM YOUNGSTOWN, OH: Is there any searchable stat that would reveal the won-loss record when Chris Boswell misses a field goal? It might just be a perception thing on my part, but it seems to me like "Boz misses; Steelers lose." Which is certainly not to assign blame to him. He's great and in the grand scheme of things his misses are few and far between. Just seems to be a correlation is all. ANSWER: You mean a searchable stat besides assigning me your personal research project? But since it's Thanksgiving and I'm in the holiday spirit, I'll play along. In games where Chris Boswell has missed a field goal during his 9-plus NFL seasons, the Steelers are 13-14-1.
JOHN WASHINSKY FROM CLEMMONS, NC: It seems to me and many of my friends that in both pro and college football, the officiating has deteriorated to produce timely inconsistent penalty calls. With the meteoric rise in sports betting, the influence of any one official's judgment can swing the tide in a game and impact large sums of money. Are there mechanisms in place to monitor the finances of officials on the field of play? ANSWER: I believe what you're referring to is fixing the outcome of a game or games, and that is a federal crime. As an example, NBA referee Tim Donaghy was investigated by the FBI based on allegations that he bet on games that he officiated. He eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 months in a federal prison. I'm not familiar with the details of the FBI investigation of Donaghy or how it progressed, but it seems to me that's the "mechanism in place" to deter and then punish what you are talking about.
MATTHIAS ELFGEN FROM OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA: I would like to ask how in the world did this schedule get put together? You play the Ravens, then the Browns (short week and on the road) and then the Bengals away. On top of that you get a 10-day stretch that contains games at Baltimore, at Philadelphia, and the Chiefs at home. What is going on here? Do we have comparable years of schedules like that? I know in the end you gotta play everyone, but this one seems highly unfavorable. ANSWER: A conspiracy theorist might be inclined to believe that all of the AFC North games for Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh were crammed into the back of the schedule because the NFL wanted to set up drama and interest for its in-season Hard Knocks on HBO.
These quotes appeared on NFL.com in June 2024 as part of a story about "Hard Knocks: In Season with the AFC North":
• Keith Cossrow, NFL Films vice president and head of content, said: "Last season the AFC North became the first division ever to have all four teams finish with a winning record, making it the perfect place to launch this new approach to 'Hard Knocks.' We thank the Bengals, Browns, Ravens and Steelers for the opportunity to showcase some of the greatest rivalries in football and present the intensity of a playoff chase from all four corners of this incredibly competitive division."
• Nancy Abraham and Lisa Heller, co-executive vice presidents, HBO Documentary and Family Programming, and Bentley Weiner, vice president, HBO Sports Documentaries said: "We are ecstatic to expand the 'Hard Knocks' universe with our partners at NFL Films to the always thrilling AFC North division race. In 2024, 'Hard Knocks' will feature the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New York Giants, and the Chicago Bears. What a year it will be on HBO and Max for football fans everywhere."
ROBERT MONTAGUE FROM ASHLAND, KY: Given that the Steelers offense is geared toward the run, why did they run the ball on first downs so predictably in the Browns game? Passing on first down keeps the defense spread out as they must respect both the pass and the run. Wouldn't a better mix of both plays help scoring? ANSWER: As I have pointed out a few times since the Thursday night game in Cleveland, what many are seeing as trends is nothing more than evidence of a poor performance by the Steelers in a particular game. There can be no argument that the running game was ineffective vs. the Browns, but in watching the game it seemed to me the problems started with the offensive line not controlling the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a successful running game has the ability to run the ball when the opponent knows the offense is going to run the ball. As just one example, in the Oct. 20 game vs. the New York Jets, the Steelers rushed for 149 yards, a 4.1 average, and 2 touchdowns on 36 attempts. Twenty of those 36 attempts came on first down. Hall of Fame guard Russ Grimm often said that a successful running game involves "moving a defender from Point A to Point B against his will." If a team is doing that, it doesn't matter what down it is, and if it cannot do that, it's not going to be successful no matter how often it mixes in a passing play to confuse the defense.

Statement from Rooney II on Savran
Statement by Steelers President Art Rooney II on the passing of Stan Savran:
Today is a sad day in the City of Pittsburgh as we lost a legendary person, media icon, and close friend with the passing of Stan Savran. He was a gentleman in every way possible, and he did so much for our city and Western Pa. with his honest candor and knowledge of all sports, both locally and nationally. Stan was involved for many years working on our Steelers Radio Network as well as doing several Steelers' interviews and shows, while also being a valuable contributor to our Hall of Honor committee.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his entire family during this difficult time. He was truly one of a kind and will be missed, but always remembered.

Steelers fall to Bills, 38-3
Contributing Writer/Editor
ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- This was not the kind of game Kenny Pickett will want to remember as his first NFL start.
Pickett was fine in his NFL debut as a starter, throwing for 327 yards. But Buffalo's Josh Allen was even better, as he threw four first-half touchdown passes and the Bills beat the Steelers, 38-3, here at Highmark Stadium.
On a windy day here along Lake Erie, Allen was unbothered, torturing an injury-depleted Steelers secondary by completing 20 of 31 passes for 424 yards with four touchdowns and an interception. He also rushed five times for 42 yards before giving way to backup Case Keenum with just over 10 minutes remaining in the game.

"We got smashed," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin.
With the Steelers (1-4) missing cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon and safety Terrell Edmunds, things got even worse in the secondary as the game wore on, as cornerback Cam Sutton also left with a hamstring injury.
That left the Steelers highly susceptible to Buffalo's high-powered passing game.
Buffalo (4-1) was depleted in the secondary as well, but Allen made sure it didn't matter, completing seven passes that went for 20-yard gains or more.
"If there's anybody who said they had a great game, they're not searching hard enough," said defensive captain Cam Heyward. "We've all got to own this, top to bottom."
Pickett completed 34 of 51 passes in his first NFL start, but the Steelers failed on three fourth down conversions deep in Buffalo territory and also missed a pair of field goals.
"We were moving the ball up and down the field," Pickett said of the Steelers, who finished with a season-high 364 total yards. But we kept stalling out in the red zone."
The Steelers appeared to have the Bills right where they wanted them after Taiwan Jones muffed the game's opening kickoff, then struggled to pick it up and was tackled at the 2 by Tre Norwood.
But on third-and-10, Allen dropped back, avoided the Steelers' pass rush and connected with Gabe Davis for a 98-yard touchdown pass behind Norwood – subbing for an injured Terrell Edmunds – and Levi Wallace to give the Bills a 7-0 lead.
"Third-and-10 from the 2, you've got to get off the field," said Steelers outside linebacker Alex Highsmith. "That was unacceptable."
Then, on the ensuing kickoff, James Pierre muffed a short kick, with the ball bouncing to Buffalo's Taron Johnson at the Pittsburgh 21.
The Steelers defense held, however, and a holding penalty pushed the Bills back, as well, forcing a 49-yard field goal attempt by Bass. Cam Sutton came off the left side and got a hand on the kick, deflecting it into Cam Heyward and the Steelers took possession at their own 40.
Pickett converted a pair of third downs with passes to George Pickens and Zach Gentry, but on third-and-8 from the Buffalo 11, he tried to thread a pass to Diontae Johnson.
The pass was initially ruled complete at the 2 as Johnson drug his toes along the sideline, and the Steelers hustled to the line of scrimmage. But Von Miller dropped to the turf and officials stopped play before the ball could be snapped, then determined that Johnson was out of bounds, forcing a 29-yard Chris Boswell field goal that cut the Buffalo lead to 7-3.
The Bills regained their touchdown advantage, stalling at the Steelers' 17 before Bass kicked a 35-yard field goal to make it 10-3 with 2:41 remaining in the first quarter.
The Steelers went three-and-out on their next possession and Pierre downed a Pressley Harvin punt at the 2. But Allen quickly moved the Bills downfield before he was intercepted by Wallace in the end zone on a pass intended for Davis from the 21.
But the Steelers again quickly punted back to the Bills and Allen and Davis again hooked up on another deep ball, this one on the first play from scrimmage after the punt. Davis wrestled the ball away from Minkah Fitzpatrick in the end zone after first catching the pass with one hand for a 62-yard touchdown reception and a 17-3 Buffalo lead with 13:56 remaining in the second quarter.
After another quick punt by the Steelers, the Bills again struck quickly, getting a 26-yard run by Devin Singletary on a play on which inside linebacker Myles Jack was penalized another 15 yards for unnecessary roughness. On the next play, Allen connected with Stephon Diggs for a 14-yard touchdown pass and a 24-3 lead with 7:20 remaining in the quarter.
The Steelers looked to answer on their next possession, driving to the Buffalo 19 before stalling, but Boswell's 33-yard field goal attempt went wide right and the Bills maintained their 24-3 lead.
Allen then struck again, leading a 77-yard touchdown drive in just 2:37, finishing it off with a 24-yard TD pass to rookie Khalil Shakur, who wrestled the ball away from cornerback Josh Jackson, who had been elevated from the practice squad on Saturday because of the injuries in the secondary.
He finished the first half 14 of 24 for 348 yards. The Steelers had 139 yards of offense.
Both teams missed on scoring opportunities in the third quarter, with the Bills' Quentin Morris fumbling into the end zone, where the loose ball was recovered by Jackson, and the Steelers then driving the length of the field only to have Boswell miss a second field goal attempt, this one from 45 yards.
Boswell's second miss came on the final play of the third quarter and the Bills quickly took just two plays to score from there, with rookie James Cook finishing things off with a 24-yard touchdown run after a Diggs catch and run of 41 yards to make it 38-3.
"We played bad and bad's an understatement," said Heyward.
"No need to sugar coat it," said Tomlin. "We got handled by a very good football team."

Player of the Week
Watt is Digest Player of the Week
Steelers.com
T.J. WATT Outside Linebacker
There was a recipe the Steelers were going to have to follow in order to leave Philadelphia with a victory, and one of the required ingredients was going to be a significant contribution from their outside linebackers. T.J. Watt certainly did his part.
In a game that ended in a 27-13 loss that dopped the Steelers to 10-4, the outside linebackers combined for 17 tackles, including 3 tackles for loss, plus 3 sacks, 4 hits on the quarterback, and 1 forced fumble. Watt personally contributed 7 of the tackles, including 1 for loss, 2 of the sacks, and the forced fumble on the Eagles' first offensive possession that Beanie Bishop recovered. Watt is the Steelers Digest Player of the Week.
Also considered were ILB Patrick Queen, who led the team with 11 tackles and had 1 hit on the quarterback; OLB Alex Highsmith, who had 8 tackles, including 2 for loss, and 1 sack; QB Russell Wilson, who completed 14-of-22 (63.6 percent) for 128 yards, with 1 touchdown, no interceptions, a rating of 94.5, while also rushing 4 times for 13 yards; WR Calvin Austin III, who caught 5 passes for 65 yards; TE Pat Freiermuth, who caught 3 passes for 22 yards, including a 9-yard touchdown; and PK Chris Boswell, who was 2-for-2 on field goals and now has converted 38-of-41 (92.7 percent) on the season.

Xtra Points
Steelers fall to Chiefs, 42-21
The Chiefs' offense started slowly but the Steelers' offense didn't get started until after a blowout had eventually ensued in Kansas City.
The Chiefs scored touchdowns on their final three possessions of the first half and their first three of the second half along the way to a 42-21 victory over the Steelers on Sunday night at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.
The Steelers exited the playoffs with an overall record of 9-8-1.
The Chiefs moved on to the next round at 13-5.
Kansas City's offensive explosion included a trick-play, 2-yard touchdown pass from tight end Travis Kelce to wide receiver Byron Pringle at the end of a nine-play, 75-yard drive in 4:57.
Kicker Harrison Butker's extra point gave the Chiefs a 42-14 lead with 14:13 left in the fourth quarter.
Quarterback Patrick Mahomes' fifth touchdown pass of the night, a 31-yard strike to wide receiver Tyreek Hill, and Butker's extra point gave the Chiefs a four-touchdown advantage at 35-7 with 9:14 left in the third quarter.
Kansas City took over at the Steelers' 29-yard line after running back Najee Harris' first fumble of the season (forced by linebacker Willie Gary, recovered by defensive end Frank Clark) on what became a two-snap scoring possession.
The Chiefs took command by driving 68 yards on nine plays in 4:47, a march that concluded on a third-and-goal, 1-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to guard Nick Allegretti, who had reported as an eligible receiver.
Butker's extra point gave the Chiefs a 28-7 lead with 10:13 left in the third.
The Chiefs took a two-score lead via a six-play, 80-yard drive in 39 seconds that ended with a 48-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Kelce on third-and-20 from the Steelers' 48 with 22 seconds left in the second quarter.
Butker's extra point upped the Chiefs' lead to 21-7.
The Chiefs took their first lead late in the second.
Big plays highlighted a seven-play, 74-yard drive in 2:43 that ended with a 12-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Pringle, a pump-fade to the corner of the end zone that beat cornerback Joe Haden.
A 31-yard catch-and-run connection from Mahomes to Kelce, a 15-yard burst by running back Jerick McKinnon and a 13-yard run by McKinnon helped set the stage for the go-ahead touchdown pass.
Butker's extra point gave the Chiefs a 14-7 lead with 1:55 left in the first half.
Kansas City scored its first touchdown on a 4-yard shovel pass from Mahomes to McKinnon. The eight-play, 76-yard drive in 4:56 included a 23-yard scramble by Mahomes on first-and-15 from the Steelers' 25.
Butker's extra point tied the game at 7-7 with 5:45 remaining before the break.
The Chiefs out-gained the Steelers, 302-44 in the opening 30 minutes and had a 16-2 edge in first downs.
The Steelers opened the scoring with a splash play on defense after a scoreless first quarter.
Outside linebacker T.J. Watt recovered a fumble forced by defensive tackle Cam Heyward and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown with 10:41 left in the second.
Kicker Chris Boswell's extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead.
Watt deflected a pass that was intercepted by inside linebacker Devin Bush on first-and-10 from the Steelers' 22 following a 48-yard punt return by wide receiver Mecole Hardman.
The Steelers scored their first offensive touchdown on a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to wide receiver Diontae Johnson with 4:10 left in the third.
The drive covered 75 yards on 10 plays in 5:04 and ended on the 35th touchdown pass of Roethlisberger's postseason career, seventh on the NFL's all-time list.
Boswell's extra point drew the Steelers to within 35-14.
Roethlisberger added a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver James Washington with 7:36 left in regulation, his 36th in a playoff game, one behind Drew Brees for No. 6 all-time.
Roethlisberger's 147 yards passing to that point against the Chiefs elevated him to No. 3 on the NFL's career playoff passing yards list at 5,904, ahead of Joe Montana (5,772) and Brett Favre (5,885). Roethlisberger ended up with 5,962 postseason passing yards.
Roethlisberger finished having completed 29 of 44 passes for 215 yards passing, with two touchdowns and no interceptions in the game that ended his 12th trip to the playoffs and, in all likelihood, his 18-year career with the Steelers.
"I'm proud to play with these guys," said Roethlisberger. "God has blessed me with an ability to throw a football and has blessed me to play in the greatest city, in Pittsburgh with the greatest fans and the greatest football team and players. And it has just been truly a blessing and I'm so thankful to Him for the opportunity that He's given me.
"Just a bunch of guys that fought for each other, that fought their butts off and just competed. It wasn't always pretty, but there are a lot of games that we found a way. I'm so proud of this group of men and the way they fight for each other, for the black and gold, for our fans. It's just been an honor to play with them."
The 15-play, 75-yard drive in 6:37 included conversions on fourth-and-1 from the Steelers' 34 (an 8-yard gain by running back Benny Snell) and fourth-and-2 from the Chiefs' 20 (a 15-yard completion from Roethlisberger to Johnson).
Boswell's extra point accounted for the 21-point final margin.
Roethlisberger's final pass found tight end Zach Gentry, who was tackled at the Chiefs' 4.
Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster returned after landing on the Reserve/Injured list and undergoing shoulder surgery following the Steelers' 27-19 win over Denver on Oct. 10.
Smith-Schuster caught five passes for 26 yards.

Tomlin taking wait-and-see approach at QB
When rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered a concussion on Oct. 16 in a win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he was cleared to return to practice the following Wednesday and played in the Steelers' game the following week at Miami.
But there's a little less clarity involving Pickett's availability for the Steelers' game this Sunday against the Carolina Panthers after he suffered a second concussion in the team's 16-14 loss last week to the Ravens.
Such is life when dealing with concussions.
"Kenny's in the protocol. We'll adhere to it. We'll rely on their expertise and let those guys provide the framework of how we proceed," Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday at his weekly press conference at the UPMC-Rooney Sports Complex.
"Participation is big for him, and the quality of that participation. The last time he sustained a concussion, he was in the protocol but was allowed to work. We'll see what this procedure is like. His ability to work will determine whether he gets an opportunity (to play). We'll take it day-by-day. He is out visiting with the doctors as we speak. If he's able to work, we'll work him."
If he is not able to get the required practice time in, Tomlin said he would make a decision this week regarding whether it will be Mitch Trubisky or Mason Rudolph to lead the Steelers (5-8) against the Panthers (5-8).
"If he's unable to work, we'll divvy those reps up between Mitch and Mason," Tomlin said. "We'll play both guys in a practice setting in an effort to make a determination what's best as we lean in on the latter part of the work.
"When you're dealing with someone in the protocol, you just simply take it day by day. Whatever the medical experts tell us in terms of the rate or work or quality of work, we'll adhere to it and make decisions accordingly based on that information."
Trubisky replaced Pickett after he was pulled against the Ravens following the Steelers' second possession. He completed 22 of 30 passes for 276 yards and a touchdown, but also threw three interceptions in the 16-14 loss.
Tomlin felt Trubisky did some good things against the Ravens, but the three interceptions – all of which came deep in Baltimore territory – were tough to swallow, especially in a two-point loss.
"I thought we moved the ball fluidly continually," Tomlin said. "That's what you had better have when you have a veteran backup like him. The reps that he misses during the week are made up for by his cumulative experience and expertise, and we felt that. We didn't feel any reduction in what we intended to do once Kenny went down and I thought we continued to move the ball fluidly. We just didn't make enough plays, particularly when the field got short. We've got to do a better job of taking care of the football.
Rudolph, meanwhile, has been inactive as the team's No. 3 quarterback all season. But Rudolph is in his fifth season with the Steelers, while Trubisky is in his first. Rudolph is 5-4-1 in his career as a starter with the Steelers.
"Both guys have remained engaged. It's really been 2 and 2A," Tomlin said of the duo. "There's a scarcity of reps, but when you've got veteran backups, guys with a cumulative body of work, particularly in Mason's case, having been exposed to us and having been here, the receivers he would work with and all of those things, often times, you're calling on past experience as a catalyst for how you move forward."
Trubisky began the season as the Steelers' starting quarterback, but was replaced by Pickett at halftime of the team's Week 4 loss to the Jets.
He hadn't played since leading the Steelers to a comeback victory against the Buccaneers in Week 6. For the season, he has completed 63.3 percent of his passes for just over 1,000 yards and four touchdowns with five interceptions.
But the choice of who starts against the Panthers will largely be determined by what happens with Pickett. If the team's first-round draft pick this season is deemed healthy by team neurologists and returns to practice, he'll play. If he is not cleared in time, he won't.
And Tomlin has no qualms about playing Pickett if he's cleared.
"I'm not a medical expert. I gain my confidence, my levels of concern, anything you would ask along those lines, from the medical experts. I'm really comfortable in that," Tomlin said.
"I've got nothing but great admiration and respect for our medical experts. People come from all over the world to visit our guys, and from different sports, as well. I'll let them do what it is they do."

Winning the weighty downs: The Steelers went into Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens ranked seventh in the NFL and fifth in the AFC in run defense.
But the Ravens were able to run the ball against the black and gold, putting up a total of 215 yards with J.K. Dobbins going for 120 yards on 15 carries, an eight-yard average.
"Oftentimes when you're not successful it's both the schematics and it's performance, and I'd say it was both," said Tomlin. "I thought they won the war of attrition as the game wore on. I thought the pile fell the direction that they desired it to. What could be second-and-eight was second-and-six. You do that consecutively, what could be third-and-four, third-and-two, those downs are played out differently in the National Football League.
"We've got to do a better job of getting them in position to minimize that pile. We got to come off blocks a little better. And we got to understand the weight of possession down ball when you're playing someone that's playing the attrition game. We had a third down and seven that we had a break down and they had a 25-yard gain and the drive extended. They ran the ball some more and they end up getting the field goal on that drive. We win that third-and-seven we're on the sideline. Those attrition plays that we discussed whether or not that pile is falling forward, and things of that nature doesn't exist."
With the Carolina Panthers on the horizon this week, led by running back D'Onta Foreman who has put up four 100-yard games this season, it's an issue the defense will have to address in practice this week to be ready to go on Sunday.
"We very much could be in that style of game again this week with the way Carolina is playing," said Tomlin. "We got some schematic work ahead of us. We got some physical work ahead of us. The pile needs to fall the direction in which we desire it to fall. And outside of that attrition component of discussion, you got to win the weighty downs. You win the weighty downs, good defenses spend a lot of time on the sideline, not playing plays. And so that's kind of the discussion regarding the attrition component what transpired last week."
Stopping the run: Another factor that has played into the defense allowing more yards in the run game as of late is going against teams that Tomlin referred to as 'run-centric' teams, with running quarterbacks in the Falcons' Marcus Mariota and the Ravens' Tyler Huntley. Mariota accounted for only 17 yards in Week 13, with Huntley adding 31 yards last week. But they are two players the defense had to be on alert for knowing they could run the ball at any minute.
"We played two run-centric teams with quarterback mobility," said Tomlin. "So, you play two teams like you're going to have somebody ringing up yards on you in the running game. If we played two teams that featured the passing game, you could be talking about six quarters of passing yards. I'm not de-sensitive to it, I just understand it's the nature of the style of ball we've been playing of late, and we got another game that could be very similar this week. So, it does have our attention"

Steelers defeat Broncos, 13-6
Contributing Writer/Editor
DENVER - If last week's performance was the opening act for the Steelers defense, Sunday's effort against the Denver Broncos was a command performance.
The Steelers shut the Broncos out for more than three quarters with a smothering defensive effort, while the offense generated 141 yards on the ground in a 13-6 victory that wasn't as close as the final score might indicate here at Empower Field at Mile High.
The win gave the Steelers their first 2-0 start since 2020. Even more importantly, both of those games came on the road, as the team heads into its home opener next Sunday against the Chargers at Acrisure Stadium.
"To go 2-0 in your first two games on the road, I'll take it," said Steelers outside linebacker T.J. Watt, who recorded his second sack of the season in the game.
Justin Fields made his second start of the season in place of an injured Russell Wilson. The Steelers didn't ask him to do much in the game knowing they entered the game with a 24-6 record against rookie quarterbacks under head coach Mike Tomlin. Fields completed 13 of his 20 passes for 117 yards and also rushed for 27 yards and a 97.3 passer rating.
The Steelers improved that record to 25-6 as they harassed Denver rookie Bo Nix throughout this game. Nix, Denver's first-round pick this year, completed 20-of-35 passes for 246 yards with two interceptions. After kicking six field goals in an 18-10 win over the Falcons last week, the Steelers scored their first touchdown of the season on their second possession of the game, marching 73 yards on 12 plays.
Fields finished off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown toss to second-year tight end Darnell Washington. It was the first career touchdown catch for Washington, who was split out wide in the formation on the play, and gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead.
The Steelers had another promising drive on their third possession after taking over at their own 1, but two holding penalties on Broderick Jones, who had entered the game at the start of the second quarter at right tackle in place of rookie Troy Fautanu, killed the drive. Fautanu, the Steelers' top pick in this year's draft, made his first career start.
The second of the two penalties was the most damaging, as Fields had rolled to his from midfield and connected with George Pickens for a gain to the Denver 6, only to have the play negated by the infraction.
After the second holding penalty, Fautanu was inserted back into the lineup in place of Jones, but the Steelers were forced to punt.
The Broncos had their best drive of the first half on their next possession, moving the ball to the Pittsburgh 39 with just over two minutes remaining in the half. But on fourth-and-7, rookie quarterback Bo Nix was pressured into an incompletion turning the ball over on downs. Denver managed just three first downs and 62 yards of offense in the first two quarters.
The Steelers, with the help of a 21-yard pass interference penalty drawn against Riley Moss on Van Jefferson, advanced to the Denver 6 with 21 seconds remaining in the half, but a touchdown catch by Pickens was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty on Jefferson.
The Steelers were forced to settle for a 22-yard Chris Boswell field goal and a 10-0 lead.
The Broncos used a trick play on their second possession of the second half to nearly double their offensive output for the game and get into scoring range for the first time.
Running out of a Wildcat formation, the Broncos had running back Javonte Williams take the snap. He handed off to wide receiver Courtland Sutton, who then tossed the ball back to Nix, who had aligned wide in the formation.
Nix then threw a 50-yard pass to receiver Josh Reynolds for a 50-yard gain between safeties Minkah Fitzpatrick, DeShon Elliott and cornerback Donte Jackson to the Pittsburgh 6.
But two plays later, Nix was intercepted in the back of the end zone on a pass intended for Sutton by Cory Trice, his first career interception, to end the threat.
Taking over at their own 20 after the turnover, the Steelers came out aggressive and Fields tossed a bomb down the sideline for Pickens. Pickens drew an interference penalty on Patrick Surtain II of 37 yards to put the ball at the Denver 43.
That led to a 53-yard Boswell field goal, his fourth 50-plus-yard field goal of the season, and a 13-0 Pittsburgh lead with 4:16 remaining in the third quarter.
The Broncos drove inside the Steelers' 20 on their next possession, including converting a fourth-and-6 from the Pittsburgh 42 with a 22-yard pass to Reynolds, but a Nix third-down pass was knocked down by Isaiahh Loudermilk. Denver took a 35-yard field goal from Will Lutz with 10:42 remaining in the game to avoid the shutout but only cut the Steelers' lead to 13-3.
The Broncos drove for another field goal, this one from 29 yards by Lutz with just under two minutes remaining, to cut the lead to 13-7.
But the Steelers ran the clock down to 18 seconds before punting the ball back to Denver, which had used all of its timeouts, with 9 seconds remaining at its own 19-yard line.
Damontae Kazee intercepted Nix to end the game.

"You get holding penalties, you're going to shut drives down," said Tomlin, noting the Steelers were highly penalized with 10 in the game. Denver had nine.
"Particularly at this state of development. We just don't have enough cohesion to overcome those type of long-yardage circumstances. Really, not a lot of people do. In September, you get a holding penalty, it's going to shut a drive down. We've got to play cleaner."
But two plays later, Nix was intercepted in the back of the end zone on a pass intended for Sutton by Corey Trice, his first career interception, to end the threat.
"To start the season with two road games and be 2-0 is a pretty good feeling," said Tomlin. "

* * *
From the NFL:
Q. When does the 2025 free agency signing period begin? A. At 4:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12.
Q. When is the two-day negotiating period for potential unrestricted free agents? A. From 12:00 p.m. ET on Monday, March 10 until 3:59:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12, clubs are permitted to contact and enter into contract negotiations with the certified agents of players who will become unrestricted free agents upon expiration of their 2024 player contracts at 4:00 p.m. ET on March 12. The two-day negotiating period applies only to prospective unrestricted free agents. It does not apply to players who have received, or who may receive, a required tender applicable to the 2025 League Year (e.g., exclusive rights players, restricted free agents, franchise players or transition players).
Q. What are the categories of free agency? A. Players are either "restricted free agents" or "unrestricted free agents." A restricted free agent may be subject to a "qualifying offer." A restricted or unrestricted free agent may be designated by his prior club as its franchise player or transition player.
Q. What is the time period for free agency signings this year? A. For restricted free agents, from March 12 to April 18.
For unrestricted free agents who have received a tender from their prior club by the Monday immediately following the final day of the NFL Draft for the 2025 League Year (i.e., April 28), from March 12 to July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later).
For franchise players, from March 12 until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 11.
For transition players, from March 12 until July 22. After July 22 and until 4 p.m. ET on the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 11, the prior club has exclusive negotiating rights to unrestricted free agents and transition players. If the above-listed players do not sign by November 11, they must sit out the season.
Q. What is the difference between a restricted free agent and an unrestricted free agent? A. In the 2025 league year, players with three accrued seasons who have received a qualifying offer become restricted free agents when their contracts expire at the conclusion of the 2024 league year on March 12. Unrestricted free agents have completed four or more accrued seasons. Upon expiration of his 2024 contract, an unrestricted free agent is free to sign with any club with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club.
Q. What constitutes an "accrued season"? A. Six or more regular season games on a club's active/inactive, reserve/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists.
Q. How do the free agency rules apply to restricted free agents? A. If a player with three accrued seasons has received a "qualifying offer" (a salary tender predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his old club, he can negotiate with any club through April 19. If the restricted free agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a "right of first refusal" on any offer sheet the player signs. If the old club does not match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the amount of its qualifying offer. If an offer sheet is not executed on or before April 18, the player's negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club. In addition, prior to the start of free agency a player who would otherwise be a restricted free agent may be designated by his old club as its franchise player or transition player.
Q. What are the right of first refusal/qualifying offer amounts for players who have completed three accrued seasons? A. For right of first refusal only, a one-year salary of at least $3,263,000.
For right of first refusal and compensation at the player's original draft round, a one-year salary of at least $3,406,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of one second-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $5,346,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of one first-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $7,458,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
For right of first refusal and compensation of only one first-round draft selection, but any provision in the new club's offer sheet waiving or limiting the new club's ability to designate the player as a franchise or transition player is not a principal term and need not be matched by the prior club, a one-year salary of at least $7,958,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater.
Q. What determines an unrestricted free agent? A. A player with four or more accrued seasons whose contract has expired. He is free to sign with any club, with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club, through July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). At that point, his negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club if by April 28 the old club tendered the player a one-year contract for 110 percent of his prior year's salary. His old club then has until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season (November 11) to sign him. If he does not sign by that date, he must sit out the season. If no tender is offered by April 28, the player can be signed by any club at any time throughout the season.
Q. What determines a franchise player? A. The salary offer by a player's club determines what type of franchise player he is: exclusive or non-exclusive. An "exclusive" franchise player – not free to sign with another club – is offered the greater of (i) the average of the top five salaries at the player's position for the current year as of the end of the restricted free agent signing period on April 18; or (ii) the amount of the required tender for a non-exclusive franchise player, as explained below.
Article 10, Section 2(a)(i) of the CBA sets forth the methodology, known as the "Cap Percentage Average," for calculating the required tender for a non-exclusive franchise player:
The Nonexclusive Franchise Tender shall be a one year NFL Player Contract for (A) the average of the five largest Prior Year Salaries for players at the position . . . at which the Franchise Player participated in the most plays during the prior League Year, which average shall be calculated by: (1) summing the amounts of the Franchise Tags for players at that position for the five preceding League Years; (2) dividing the resulting amount by the sum of the Salary Caps for the five preceding League Years . . . ; and (3) multiplying the resulting percentage by the Salary Cap for the upcoming League Year . . . (the "Cap Percentage Average") . . . ; or (B) 120% of his Prior Year Salary, whichever is greater .
If a club extends a required tender to a "non-exclusive" franchise player pursuant to this section, the player shall be permitted to negotiate a player contract with any club, except that draft-choice compensation of two first-round draft selections shall be made in the event he signs with a new club.
Q. How many franchise players and transition players can a team designate each season? A. A club can designate one franchise player or one transition player among its potential restricted or unrestricted free agents.
Q. Can a club decide to withdraw its franchise or transition designation on a player? A. Yes. A club can withdraw its franchise or transition designation, and the player then automatically becomes an unrestricted free agent, either immediately if the tender is withdrawn after the start of the 2025 league year, or when his 2024 contract expires if the tender is withdrawn before the start of the 2025 league year.
Q. What is the salary cap for 2025? A. The salary cap is $279,200,000 per club.
Q. When must teams be in compliance with the salary cap? A. At the start of the 2025 league year, which begins at 4:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12.
Q. If a team is under the salary cap at the end of a given season, can the team "carry over" room to the next season? A. Yes. A team may carry over room from one league year to the following league year by submitting notice to the NFL prior to 4:00 p.m. ET on the day following the team's final regular-season game, indicating the amount of room that the club wishes to carry over.
Q. What is the maximum amount of room that a club can carry over? A. A club can carry over 100 percent of its remaining 2024 room to its adjusted salary cap for 2025.

The Steelers had trailed 31-3 at halftime on the way to a 41-10 loss on Nov. 28 at Cincinnati and 23-0 at the break during what became a 36-28 loss on Dec. 9 at Minnesota.
The Chiefs picked up 17 first downs to the Steelers' six while building a 23-0 advantage in the first two quarters. The Chiefs also out-gained the Steelers, 255-109, and held the ball for 20:00 to the Steelers' 10:00 in the first 30 minutes.
The Steelers didn't get on the scoreboard until 3:34 remained in the third quarter.
Kicker Chris Boswell's 34-yard field goal reduced Kansas City's lead to 30-3. Boswell's effort capped a 15-play, 54-yard drive in 5:19.
A 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to wide receiver Diontae Johnson on fourth-and-4 from the Chiefs' 15-yard line and Boswell's extra point accounted for the final margin.
The touchdown drive covered 85 yards on 17 plays in 6:47.
The Chiefs had increased their 23-0 halftime lead on quarterback Patrick Mahomes' third touchdown pass of the day. Mahomes hit wide receiver Byron Pringle for a 16-yard, catch-and-run touchdown with 8:53 left in the third. Kicker Elliott Fry's extra point made it 30-0.
The seven-play, 51-yard drive in 3:51 commenced at the Kansas City 49 after safety Tyrann Mathieu recovered a Johnson fumble that occurred after a catch and a gain of 2.
Fry's 34-yard field goal with 12:40 left in the fourth quarter re-established a 30-point lead for the Chiefs at 33-3.
His third field goal of the day, this one from 30 yards away, gave Kansas City a 36-3 lead with 10:30 left in the fourth.
Kansas City had taken over at the Steelers' 7 after a strip-sack of Roethlisberger by defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton and a fumble recovery and 10-yard return by defensive tackle Jarran Reed.
The start was a harbinger of what was ahead.
The Chiefs had two touchdowns before the Steelers registered two first downs.
Kansas City's first score came on a 1-yard run by running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire that capped a 14-play, 78-yard drive in 8:10 on the home team's first possession. The Chiefs converted a third-and-7 and a fourth-and-1 on the march, which didn't include a play longer than 13 yards. Fry's extra point gave the Chiefs a 7-0 lead with 4:07 left in the first quarter.
The Chiefs got the ball back on the Steelers' next offensive snap when Roethlisberger was intercepted by cornerback Charvarius Ward at the Steelers' 49.
Kansas City needed six plays and 2:54 to score another touchdown. The drive ended on a 5-yard pass from Mahomes to Pringle. Fry's extra point gave Kansas City a 14-0 lead with 1:05 left in the first.
A 44-yard field goal by Fry upped the Chiefs' lead to 17-0 with 8:45 left in the second quarter.
Kansas City drove 54 yards on 10 plays in 5:01.
The lead grew to 23-0 on an 8-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman with 2:13 left in the first half (the extra point was missed).
The Steelers had driven from their 25 to the Chiefs' 18 on the previous possession, but Boswell missed a 36-yard field goal attempt. Punter Corliss Waitman filled in at holder for punter Pressley Harvin III, who missed the game for personal reasons. It snapped a streak of 43 consecutive field goals converted from inside 40 yards for Boswell.
Fry missed a 39-yard field goal attempt with 18 seconds left before the break.
The Steelers had turned the ball over on downs when a toss to running back Najee Harris lost 3 yards on fourth-and-1 from the Steelers' 34.

Opponents on Steelers
Vikings are talking about T.J., Ben and Minkah
The Steelers are on the road this week, taking on the Minnesota Vikings on a short week on Thursday Night Football.
For both teams the work is condensed, but there is still plenty of work taking place on both sides.
"We're getting ready for a big game against Pittsburgh," said Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer. "They've got a terrific defense. Very stout 3-4 (defense). Second in the league in three and outs offensively. (Ben) Roethlisberger can still fling it all over the place. Big strong back. Good on special teams.
"So, were going to have to play good."
The Vikings know they have their work cut out for them this week, and talked about several Steelers, including Roethlisberger, T.J. Watt and Minkah Fitzpatrick.
* * *
Coach Mike Zimmer on T.J. Watt: "He is a game wrecker. He's not by himself. They have some other guys too. But he's a game wrecker. He always seems to make the big plays. A terrific rusher. He is very violent and physical."
Zimmer on Watt being in the talk for Defensive Player of the Year and what that takes: "Number one he is smart, a great rusher, quick off the line of scrimmage. Good power. Then I think he sees things really well. Most great players have really good vision. They see a lot of different things. He fights through chips, understands where the protection is going, things like that."
Quarterback Kirk Cousins on Watt: "I think there has to be an awareness of where he is. You have to give a player like that, who has been so productive, respect and understand where he is at."
Zimmer on Coach Mike Tomlin: "I don't know him great. I know him from competing against him. He has always been a gentleman. He has always stood for the right things. He's been on the competition committee, so we've had some conversations. I think he does things the right way. His team plays the right way. I have a lot of respect for him."
Zimmer on the Steelers having just three coaches since 1969: "That's how it should be."
Zimmer on if Ben Roethlisberger is any different this year than he has been in the past: "Really not much honestly. He is really good at seeing the pressure, where the hots are, getting the ball out. Maybe he doesn't run quite as much as he used to. He was never really a runner, but he is a strong physical guy to get on the ground. He still throws a deep ball great. Very smart and savvy with where he wants to go with the ball. He does a lot of checking at the line of scrimmage.
"I don't see much difference in him. Good arm. The passing game is very similar to what it has been for a long time. Maybe a few more RPOs, but he's good."
Zimmer on Roethlisberger being in command at quarterback for so long and if that indicates a strong belief in him: "I am sure they believe in him. He has been there for so long, it's the longevity of what they have been able to do. They've also been good on defense. Tomlin does a great job. For all of the time when I was in Cincinnati and played against him he was a tough out."
Cousins on Roethlisberger and if he knows him well: "I unfortunately haven't gotten to intersect with him as much as I would have liked. I remember I went to a college game of his when I was in high school, he was playing at Miami of Ohio. I followed him growing up in the Midwest, he was playing in the MAC.
"I watched him win two Super Bowls. He's going to have a Gold Jacket someday. There is a lot of respect for what he has done. I have also extra respect for somebody who has done it for that many years, and not just a good stretch of five or six years. To do it for 18 years is so impressive. A lot of respect for him and his journey."
Zimmer on Minkah Fitzpatrick: "They've changed a little bit what some of the schemes they are doing now. He is very instinctive, can come off a guy. We have to be careful of where he is at all of the time."
Wide receiver Justin Jefferson on Fitzpatrick: "I definitely watched him at Alabama. He is a great player. He is a ball hawk."

Tomlin not ready to embrace a shootout mentality
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers posted 520 yards and rang up the scoreboard for their highest totals since the 2018 season in Sunday's 44-38 win over the Bengals.
But don't expect head coach Mike Tomlin to be all too comfortable in those types of games. A defensive-minded coach, Tomlin is never at ease when his team gets into a shootout.
It is nice, however, to know that he has an offense capable of putting up those kind of numbers.
He'd just much rather his defense shut a team down and not have to see his team put 40 points on the board.
"I don't know that I'm ever comfortable planning to shoot out," Tomlin said Tuesday. "It's just my background and my expertise. To be quite honest with you, I respect offenses and talented players, and I acknowledge when we're faced with stiff challenges, but it doesn't mean that I'll ever be comfortable in those circumstances.
"I have certain expectations because of my professional journey on defense, that I expect us to slow those things down and minimize some of that and the rare instances that we don't. I'm thankful that we have an offense that's capable of matching it."
The Steelers (9-3) came out attacking against the Bengals (4-8), knowing Cincinnati would have at least some success moving the ball. Quarterback Joe Burrow is having an outstanding season, leading the league in passing yards and touchdown passes, while wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins form one of the league's top duos.
With that in mind, offensive coordinator Arthur Smith called 27 passing plays and nine runs in the first half, as quarterback Russell Wilson threw for 257 yards in the first half – a career-high for a half – en route to posting 414 passing yards and three touchdowns.
Most importantly, the Steelers offense answered Cincinnati score for score over the course of the first half, eventually taking a 27-21 halftime lead, with the Steelers increasing that to 41-24 early in the fourth quarter after a strip-sack by Nick Herbig was turned into a scoop-and-score by rookie linebacker Payton Wilson.
That back-and-forth included Wilson being intercepted on the Steelers' fourth play of the game when wide receiver George Pickens was thrown to the ground by cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt. Taylor-Britt returned the interception for a 51-yard touchdown. But instead of adjusting the plan of attack, the Steelers and Smith continued to throw the ball.
"Obviously the game didn't get started the way that we would like in terms of the pick six, but I just liked the offense's quick response to that in terms of taking the ball and going back down the field," Tomlin said. "I thought the offense, in several circumstances, displayed the type of complimentary response that you need from an offense, whether it was a turnover response like that or response to a scoring drive by Cincinnati's offense, I just love that component of our play that was on display."
The Steelers could need a similar output – however uncomfortable it might make Tomlin – this week against the Cleveland Browns.
The two teams met two weeks ago in Cleveland, a game won 24-19 by the Browns in a snowstorm. Monday night, Cleveland quarterback Jameis Winston completed 34 of 58 passes for a team-record 497 yards and four touchdowns, though he also threw three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.
After failing to score more than 18 points in a game with Deshaun Watson at quarterback in the first half of the season, Cleveland has scored 24 or more points in three of Winston's five starts.
"It was some explosive playmaking," said Tomlin. "They went up and down the field."
So, getting into high-scoring affairs might not bring Tomlin comfort, but he knows that the Steelers, with Wilson at quarterback, are capable of winning those types of games.
Wilson is averaging 271 passing yards per game, second in the NFL behind only Burrow, and the Steelers have averaged 28.7 points per game in his six starts.
Against Cincinnati, he consistently got the Steelers into good plays at the line of scrimmage and utilized all of his eligible receivers. Ten different players caught passes and the Steelers got 13 catches for 146 yards from their running backs and nine receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown from their tight ends.
"Russ' experience helps with everything you could," Tomlin said of the 13-year veteran. "Apply that to any discussion. He's been doing it at a high level for over a decade."
Injury update: Tomlin expects outside linebacker Alex Highsmith, who has missed the past three games with a sprained ankle, to be back in the lineup next Sunday against the Browns.
How they deploy him will be interesting.
The Steelers are 3-3 this season when Highsmith has missed games. They're 6-0 when he's played, recording 19 tackles and 3 sacks.
In his absence, second-year pro Nick Herbig has produced 17 tackles and 4.5 sacks. He's also forced a fumble in three consecutive games.
The Steelers utilized some three outside linebacker packages also using veteran Preston Smith – acquired at the trade deadline – with Herbig and T.J. Watt on Sunday against Cincinnati and have employed that look in the past.
"It's pretty exciting, isn't it?" Tomlin said. "Let's see where the roads lead. We've got a week of prep. You can't run out of rushmen. I'm so excited about the potential of getting Alex Highsmith back, and you know, the development of her big the acclimation of Preston.
"You can't run out of rushmen, particularly in December. So it's exciting. Make no mistake, there's enough work for all parties involved, and we're excited about sorting that out as we prepare."
Tomlin said wide receiver Calvin Austin III is in concussion protocol after leaving the win over the Bengals early in the second half.
Two players who are currently on the Reserve/Injured List also could return this week.
Cornerback Cory Trice had his 21-day practice window opened on Nov. 14, so would need to be activated to the active roster this week or he would revert to season-ending injured reserve. Meanwhile, the team opened the practice window for defensive tackle Montravius Adams last week.

Porter's tough day: Cornerback Joey Porter was penalized six times against the Bengals, with four of those being accepted.
But as he did following the win, Tomlin said that's the cost of doing business, especially against a physical receiver such as Cincinnati's Higgins.
"You have to match the physicality of these big people, and sometimes you do so at risk, and that's just a tight rope that I and he are willing to walk in an effort to be competitive," Tomlin said. "One thing we're not going to do is turn it down and allow him to catch the ball. He's a big guy, as you saw that touchdown he had late in the game against Cam Sutton. He is a challenge. And so when we play Shaq (O'Neal), we're going to use our fouls. We're not going to allow them to get us off the block. If you need a basketball analogy."
That being said, Tomlin acknowledged there are some things Porter could do differently to avoid at least some of the penalty calls.
"Certainly he could have been better from a technical standpoint," Tomlin said. "In review of the tape (there were) some technical things at the line of scrimmage that oftentimes lead to circumstances down the field could be better, but as I mentioned after the game, a component of that is competing against the likes of Tee Higgins and his style of play."
Tomlin does, however, like Porter's approach.
"He's got a serial killer's mentality, but if you're going to be a top-flight corner, you better," Tomlin said. "And that's probably one of the things that I knew about him because of our personal relationship that really made me comfortable drafting him. It's not fake, it's real. He's not running from the fight. He's running to the fight. You better have a short memory at that position, and he's always had it. He was probably nine or 10 when I met him, and he had it."

Steelers defense faces stiff opening test in 49ers
The Steelers feel good about the pieces they've added to their defense in the offseason. But they won't know for sure that they've upgraded at any of those spots until they start playing regular season games.
That will happen Sunday when they open the 2023 season at Acrisure Stadium against the San Francisco 49ers. And opening against the 49ers is just about as stiff a test for a defense as can be had in the NFL.
In running back Christian McCaffery, tight end George Kittle and wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk, the 49ers have perhaps the best group of skill position weapons in the NFL.
They will present a stiff challenge to a defense that has completely revamped itself in the middle of the field, adding inside linebackers Cole Holcomb, Elandon Roberts and Kwon Alexander, as well as safety Keanu Neal and nickel cornerbacks Chandon Sullivan and Desmond King. King was acquired by the Steelers just last week.
"I think it's just starts with Christian McCaffrey," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "We have got to respect the dynamic playmaking ability that he has both in the running game and in the passing game.
"He's dynamic in the run game. He's dynamic in the passing game, we better be really careful about being matched up against him in space. He's a one-on-one space winner. They have a lot of one-on-one space winners. He might be the most dynamic one-on-one space winner at running back in the NFL. Kittle might be that at tight end. Debo Samuels might be that at receiver. Their run-after (the catch) ability with their offense of eligibles is really impressive."
It will be a good test for the Steelers, particularly perhaps at inside linebacker.
Holcomb, Roberts and Alexander were brought in this season after the Steelers either moved on from Myles Jack and allowed Devin Bush and Robert Spillane to leave in free agency.
That group produced little splash in 2022, accounting for just one sack, no interceptions and no forced fumbles and nine combined tackles for a loss.
The new group at inside linebacker had a strong preseason presence, but it was just that, the preseason.
The real tests await.
"I think that'll be revealed to play," Tomlin said of whether that group has been upgraded. "I don't live in a hypothetical world. That tape is going to be our walking and talking and breathing resume for the individuals within the collective or from smaller collectives."
No player will test that group quite like McCaffery.
A 1,000-yard rusher and receiver in 2019 with the Carolina Panthers, McCaffery was acquired via a trade by the 49ers midway through last season.
In 11 games with the 49ers, McCaffery rushed for 746 yards and caught 52 passes for 464 yards, scoring 10 combined touchdowns.

The 49ers were 3-3 before acquiring McCaffery and went 10-1 in the regular season after the trade, seeing their points per game average jump from 20.3 to 29.8.
He helps the 49ers be especially dangerous when it comes to the use of play-action, as well as presenting a major challenge when he splits out wide. And that plays right into the hands of head coach Kyle Shanahan's offensive scheme.
Shanahan is considered one of the best offensive schemers in the NFL and will attempt to create mismatches in the passing game.
"It's a coach's challenge from a fundamental and technical standpoint and players' challenge from a tackling standpoint," Tomlin said. "They have got a really solid motor operation offensively of diverse attack. They have got an awesome running game. They have got a supporting misdirection and play-action passing game. They're thoughtfully aggressive in terms of how they go down the field and they do it in a variety of ways. They play really good situational football offensively and allows them to take care of the ball and minimize negativity. They stay on schedule very well,
"But I think that's reflective of Kyle Shanahan and, and he's been around a lot and we've been exposed to him a lot over the years. And I just think that regardless of new and current chess pieces that's kind of reflective of how he has always played over the years, and I have got a lot of respect for what he does and the manner in which he does it. Familiarity doesn't necessarily provide comfort. It just provides focus, as we prepare and work to demand the things that he and they do."
Level of comfort: One of the more interesting battles through training camp and the preseason was the one at left tackle, where third-year veteran Dan Moore Jr. and rookie No. 1 pick Broderick Jones both had impressive showings in the preseason.
Only one can come away the starter, and that was Moore, who started 33 games over the last two seasons at left tackle.
Coach Mike Tomlin said he likes what the team has at that position, with two capable left tackles ready to go, and that Moore earned the starting role.
"I thought he played really well," said Tomlin of Moore. "I thought he showed the growth and maturation that comes with the 1,000 or so snaps that he's played over the last two years. Really comfortable there."
His level of comfort with Moore isn't a bad reflection on Jones, though. It's just that the Steelers have depth, something that any team would welcome, at the left tackle spot.
"Also really excited about what Broderick showed us," said Tomlin. "We were very thoughtful about making sure he got a lot of reps during the course of development, particularly in preseason stadiums. I like the work he did there.
"I feel really good about our left tackle position. I feel really good about Dan's growth and development. I feel really good about the acquisition of Broderick and how bright his future is. I know oftentimes depth charts produce stories, what's wrong with Broderick, etc. There is nothing wrong with Broderick. There was nothing wrong with Cam Heyward when he watched.
"If you have a good team. If you have people playing well, oftentimes it means young, capable guys have an opportunity to watch as they grow and develop. That is the story of the left tackle position and I feel really comfortable about where we are."
Another position where a wait and watch approach is going to be taken right off the bat is at cornerback, where rookie No. 2 pick Joey Porter Jr. is a backup at his spot, particularly after dealing with injuries in the preseason.
"We were able to get him a lot of reps, particularly over the last several weeks," said Tomlin. "Obviously, he missed a game and there's consequences for that from a development standpoint, but he made a lot of plays in team development in Latrobe. Highly competitive. Feel really good about his growth and development and the trajectory of it and what he's able to provide us not only in the short term, but the long term."
Born leaders: The Steelers announced their captains for the 2023 season on Monday, and Coach Mike Tomlin is well aware it's a group that will be depended on for their leadership on and off the field this year.
"The leadership displayed…it can be reflected by our captain voting," said Tomlin. "I am proud of the group this group selected."
The captains are Kenny Pickett on offense, Cameron Heyward and T.J. Watt on defense and Miles Killebrew on special teams.
Pickett is a captain for the first time, a player who showed leadership from the moment he stepped on the field his rookie season and it's only improved.
"I think him being the lone captain on offense is no disrespect to the leadership of others, but probably more of a reflection of everyone's feel of his growth and development, not only as a player, but as a leader within this collective," said Tomlin. "It's reflective of the teams' view of him and his growth and development."
Heyward and Watt are no strangers to the captain role. Heyward is a captain for ninth consecutive year, while Watt is a captain for the third time.
"Cam Heyward and T.J. Watt are guys that have been mainstays here for some time now," said Tomlin. "Not only lead by what it is they do, but the manner in which they do it. The things they do inside stadiums and the things they do outside of stadiums on a day-to-day basis provide a blueprint for others to follow."
This is the second straight year Killebrew was selected as the special teams captain and his leadership will be crucial with some of the turnover that unit has seen.
"I can't say enough about Miles Killebrew and what he has done in that phase since he has been here," said Tomlin. "His kick blocking ability. His passion. His attention to detail. His leadership.
"We are going through a transition in that phase of our team. Arthur Maulet, Robert Spillane, Derek Watt, Marcus Allen who filled up our tackle sheet on special teams a year ago are no longer here. He is probably the most central returning figure. As other guys gain traction, his leadership and production and play making is going to be important to us in that growth and development of that collective and the speed in which it happens is going to be important to us as we embark on this thing."

Steelers add to defensive coaching staff
Steelers.com
The Steelers hired Anthony Midget as the team's assistant secondary coach.
Midget comes to the Steelers with nine years of NFL experience, after spending three seasons as the secondary coach with the Tennessee Titans (2020-22).
The Titans third-down percentage defense was ranked third in the NFL in 2022 and their opponents converted only 34.2 percent of their attempts.
The Titans defense tied for 10th in the NFL with 16 interceptions in 2021 and fourth in the NFL with 83 passes defensed.
In his first season with the Titans in 2020, the defense ranked seventh in the NFL with 15 interceptions.
Prior to joining the Titans, he spent six seasons with the Houston Texans, four as the assistant secondary coach (2014-17) and two as the secondary coach (2018-19).
In his final season in Houston, Midget worked with a defensive backfield that helped the Texans win their second consecutive AFC South title and their fourth in five years, despite new faces in the secondary.
In 2018, the Texans allowed only 19.8 points per game, including an NFL-best 17.3 points per game from Weeks 5-17.
In 2017, the Texans were tied with the Steelers, Bengals and Dolphins for the NFL lead with three different defensive backs posting at least one interception and sack. The Texans finished the 2016 season with the NFL's top-ranked defense for the first time in franchise history, while in 2015 the defense finished third in the NFL in net yards and net passing yards allowed per game.
Prior to his time in the NFL, he spent time in the college ranks, including as safeties coach at Penn State (2013). Penn State's pass defense efficiency ranked fifth in the Big Ten and they were one of only two teams (Ohio State) to have three players ranked in the top 20 in passes defensed in the conference.
Midget spent five seasons at Georgia State, one as defensive coordinator (2012) and four as a combination of secondary/special teams coordinator (2008-11). He joined the college ranks as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Virginia Tech, where they won the 2007 ACC title. He began his coaching career on the high school level at Lake Worth (Florida) High School (2003-06).
Midget was a three-year starting cornerback at Virginia Tech. His senior year he earned third team All-American honors and first team All-Big East honors.  He was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

Steelers fall to Cardinals
Contributing Writer/Editor
Prior to Sunday's meeting between Arizona and the Steelers, the Cardinals winning in Pittsburgh was about as rare as a December thunderstorm in Western Pennsylvania.
The Steelers had what they thought was momentum offensively coming into Sunday's game against the Cardinals. Instead, the momentum was turned early in the game and the Steelers were never able to recover it, as they fell to the Cardinals in a storm-delayed game, giving Arizona its first victory in Pittsburgh since 1969, 24-10.
The loss drops the Steelers to 7-5 this season with a game looming Thursday night at Acrisure Stadium against New England.
"That was a horrible day at the office. We didn't do much right in that game," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "So we've got to own that. Obviously starting first and foremost with me.
"Just losing football, really was. We were highly penalized, some pre-snap penalties, some operational penalties, bad snaps. Just JV football in a lot of ways."
To make matters worse, quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an ankle injury late in the first half, while the Steelers also lost inside linebacker Elandon Roberts (groin) and guard Isaac Seumalo (shoulder) to injuries in this game. Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who was returning to the lineup after missing the past four games with a hamstring injury, also suffered a broken bone in his left hand in the second quarter, though he did not miss any time.

The first half couldn't have gone much worse for the Steelers, despite moving the ball seemingly at will – except on third downs, where the Steelers were 1 of 6 on conversions in the first 30 minutes.
But two trips inside the Arizona 20 netted just three points, as they stalled on their opening possession when Pickett threw incomplete twice on second- and third-and-5 at the Arizona 11, forcing a 29-yard Chris Boswell field goal.
Their second trip deep into Arizona territory was even more damaging, as the Steelers drove to the 7 with the game tied at 3-3.
The Steelers ran Najee Harris twice for a pair of 2-yard gains, and Pickett scrambled to the 1 on third down. But he suffered an ankle injury reaching for the goal line and left the game.
Backup Mitch Trubisky entered and Harris was stopped for no gain from the 1 turn turn the ball over on downs.
"We've got to score points in order to win football games," said Tomlin. "And so not going to question our aggression there. We've got to be able to get a yard."
To make matters worse, the Cardinals (3-10), who had 26 yards of offense on 18 plays to that point, mounted a drive from there, converting five third downs and scoring just before the half.
Kyler Murray connected with tight end Trey McBride on second-and-goal for what was initially ruled a touchdown, but overturned upon review as Fitzpatrick knocked the ball from his hands as he went to the ground.
Then, on third-and-goal Murray went back to McBride at the goal line for a touchdown that gave Arizona a 10-3 lead at the half.
"That hurt not being able to get off the field on that drive," said linebacker Alex Highsmith, who had 1.5 sacks in the game. "We've got to be a better defense than that."
After a lengthy delay for lightning in the area, the game resumed with the Steelers getting a three-and-out stop on the Cardinals to start the second half.
But Trubisky, who stayed in the game in place of Pickett, was unable to handle a low snap from center Mason Cole and the Cardinals recovered the loose football at the Pittsburgh 21.
On third-and-goal from the 8, rookie cornerback Joey Porter was penalized for pass interference after getting his feet tangled with wide receiver Greg Dortch, giving the Cardinals the ball at the 1. Two plays later, Conner scored on a run to push Arizona's lead to 17-3 with 7:18 remaining in the third quarter.
But before the ball could be kicked off again, the game was delayed for a second time.
Even that couldn't change the momentum for the Cardinals.
Arizona fumbled twice following the second weather stoppage but recovered the loose ball both times.
And when Conner scored his second touchdown, this one from 9 yards out with 8:28 remaining, it was simply a matter of what the final score would be in the game.
The Steelers tacked on a 2-yard touchdown catch by Diontae Johnson from Trubisky with 4:25 remaining to cut the score to 24-10, but the damage was already done.
Conner finished the game with 25 for 105 yards to go with his two touchdowns. Conner had 15 carries for 88 yards in the second half.
"Just lack of execution. Lack of detail. I don't know what it is," said Trubisky. "I feel like we had a pretty good plan going into the red zone this week. We just didn't find a way.
"Whether it's them making plays and us not, there's no excuse. We've got to find a way to score points somehow. Just gotta maneuver points and just focus when we get down in the red zone. We moved the ball today. But it doesn't matter when you shoot yourself in the foot and go backwards on plays you shouldn't."

Steelers name Alexander defensive backs coach
Steelers.com
The Steelers named Gerald Alexander the team's defensive backs coach.
Alexander is no stranger to the Steelers coaching staff, having spent two seasons (2022-23) as the assistant defensive backs coach with the team, before leaving to become the safeties coach for the Las Vegas Raiders in 2024.
In two years in Pittsburgh he worked with a secondary that recorded 36 interceptions, which was tied for second in the league. In 2023, the defense held opponents to a 84.7 passer rating, whcih was 10th best in the NFL.
In Alexander's first year with the Steelers, he worked with a secondary that was tied for first in the NFL in interceptions with 20 in 2022. Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick finished that season with a career-high and NFL leading six interceptions while earning first team Associated Press All-Pro honors.
Prior to his first stint with the Steelers, Alexander was the defensive backs coach for the Miami Dolphins for two seasons (2020-21). Under his leadership, the defensive backs tied for first in the NFL in interceptions with 18 in 2020, while cornerback Xavien Howard had 10 interceptions and was selected first team Associated Press All-Pro for the first time.
Alexander broke into the coaching ranks on the college level as an undergraduate assistant at Arkansas State in 2013 and then a graduate assistant at Washington in 2014. He also spent time as a defensive backs coach at Indiana State (2015), Montana State (2016) and California (2017-19). During his time coaching in college, he held NFL two minority coaching internships, with the Tennessee Titans in 2015 and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2016.
During his time at Cal, Alexander worked with All-Pac-12 defensive backs Ashtyn Davis and Camryn Bynum. Davis went from a walk-on to a third-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft by the New York Jets while Bynum was selected in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. Cal also led the Pac-12 in and ranked second nation-wide with 21 interceptions in 2018.
Alexander also spent five years playing in the NFL after he was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He spent time with the Lions (2007-08), Jacksonville Jaguars (2009-10), Carolina Panthers (2010), Miami Dolphins (2011) and New York Jets (2011). He appeared in 44 games, starting 30, and finished with 154 tackles, 116 of them solo stops, 14 passes defensed, four interceptions, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and two sacks.
Alexander, who is from Los Angeles, played college football at Boise State.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Dec. 12
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
DAVE MILLER FROM CHADRON, NE: It seems the Steelers did OK in the Donte Jackson for Diontae Johnson trade. Can you tell me which of those two guys has been the more prolific pass catcher over the past six weeks? ANSWER: In the last 6 weeks, Donte Jackson has had 2 interceptions. In the last 6 weeks – with one of those including the Ravens' bye week and another when he was suspended for conduct detrimental to the team, Diontae Johnson had 1 reception. And if you can believe it, I actually had to defend this trade in a couple of installments of Asked and Answered.
ROY PERRIN FROM RALEIGH, NC: Now that the Pro Bowl is flag football, what is the pay for the winners and losers of the game? If I'm not mistaken (and I could be), wasn't it a relatively significant amount? ANSWER: For the 2024 Pro Bowl, which was played toward the tail end of the 2023 season players on the winning conference received $88,000 apiece and the players on the losing conference were paid $44,000 apiece.
ERIC HUTTINGER FROM DAYTON, OH: I was watching an episode of the Christian Kuntz podcast, and it was brought up that Cameron Johnston was still very involved in the kicking game by providing exceptional scouting reports for upcoming opponents. God forbid he can't continue his punting career, but if that was the case, do the Steelers employ a kicking coach/coordinator? ANSWER: Currently, the only member of the coaching staff who spends all of his time with special teams is coordinator Danny Smith. There are assistant coaches who put their hand in the pile and help out with certain aspects of special teams play, and that has been the case for a long time. Coach Mike Tomlin talks about working with special teams when he was a young assistant in the NFL.
LOU BRANDLE FROM JOHNSTOWN, PA: When we're inside the 10-yard line and run the ball, why isn't Justin Fields taking the snaps? ANSWER: My personal opinion on a package for Justin Fields is that it should be utilized in situations while not becoming predictable. If Fields would replace Russell Wilson every time the Steelers offense was in the red zone and wanted to run the football, the opponent would know what was coming and when it was coming. We'll have to see how things unfold over the last 4 games of the regular season, but being unpredictable with when it's used and using it in small doses is how I would proceed.
MICHAEL PAOLINI FROM SCHWENKSVILLE, PA: I was at the game on Sunday against the Browns. I thought the Steelers offensive game plan was terrible. I know a win is a win, but they did not have a running game. The passing was non-existent. No passes in the middle, no deep shots, and the lack of execution. What happened? ANSWER: Yes, a win is a win, and the Steelers are 10-3, which must have been achieved by magic for them to be as awful as your opinion of them. Leading up to the game vs. Cleveland, the Steelers believed they would be playing with George Pickens at wide receiver right up until a few hours before kickoff. That means the entire offensive game plan was devised, implemented, and practiced with the thought the team's No. 1 receiver would be available. Losing Pickens for the whole game at that late stage required a lot of adjusting and changing personnel packages, while it also removed a significant threat for the Browns to have to defend. Maybe you were at the concession stand for Pat Freiermuth's 20-yard touchdown catch down the middle, and you somehow missed the Steelers rushing for 120 yards, a total that included a 20-yard gain by Najee Harris and a 14-yard gain by Jaylen Warren. Did you at least enjoy the weather last Sunday?
VALERIE ROSE FROM LIVINGSTON, NJ: What is a nickel package? I heard one of the announcers mention it about 2 weeks ago during one of our games. ANSWER: A nickel package refers to the occasions when the 11 players on the field for the defense include 5 defensive backs, and those defensive backs can be any combination of cornerbacks and safeties. A dime package is similar but in this alignment the defense on the field consists of 6 defensive backs.
JORGE FERNANDO PAZ FROM MEXICO CITY, MEXICO: I saw the Steelers are badly outscored in the first quarter. Can you please give me the scores by quarters this season? ANSWER: Through 13 games this season, the Steelers have been outscored, 72-45, in the first quarter; they outscored their opponents, 87-64, in the second quarter; outscored their opponents, 90-16, in the third quarter; and they outscored their opponents, 101-86, in the fourth quarter. As the numbers show, the Steelers are treating their opponents worse in the third quarter than those opponents are treating them in the first quarter.

Labriola on the loss to the Chiefs
Steelers.com
Their problems, whatever they are, have not been fixed. They have talked about fixing them, they have vowed to do the necessary work to fix them. But when it comes time to play a game, it's clear their problems have not been fixed.
Three games ago, the Steelers were 10-3 and sitting atop the AFC North with a 2-game lead over Baltimore, with a mathematical chance to compete for the top seed in their conference. Everything they had talked about achieving and had worked for months to get into position to achieve, all of it was right in front of them and completely in their control. But now they're on a three-game losing streak after a 29-10 defeat on a Christmas Day that was anything but merry.
Even though this loss came at the hands of the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs, they should take no solace in that because the problems that cost them in Philadelphia proved to be versions of the issues that cost them in Baltimore six days later, and then things somehow were even worse four days after that.
"You know, that sucked, to be blunt," said Coach Mike Tomlin to open his postgame remarks to the media. "Not the type of ball we want to play, and really kind of eerily similar to our last performance in that we're not doing the fundamental things well enough. We're turning the ball over. We're not getting turnovers. That hasn't been a recipe for us, but it has been of late."
Those 10-3 Steelers had climbed to the upper rungs of the NFL in takeaways (28) and turnover ratio (plus-17) thanks to a top-5 defense that tortured opponents with relentless pressure, and they also exhibited a resiliency that helped them win twice as often as they lost when involved in 1-score games. But these 10-6 Steelers are none of those things, certainly none of those things consistently enough to win games against the caliber of competition they've faced over the last 11 days.
During the losing streak, their sack total went from 3 to 1 to none, their takeaways from 2 to 1 to none, and their turnover ratio from plus-1 to minus-1 to minus-2. Consequently they lost to the Eagles by 14 points, then to the Ravens by 17, and then to the Chiefs by 19.
Exacerbating the declining takeaway totals is the number of squandered opportunities for takeaways. Four times the ball was on the ground in the games against Baltimore and then Kansas City, and the Steelers came up with none of them. Balls batted into the air fell incomplete instead of secured by a defender for an interception. And some of these misses have turned out to be real tone-setters, coming at the times in which they did.
Against the Ravens for example, Alex Highsmith strip-sacked Lamar Jackson only to have the ball recovered by the guy who gave up the sack. If the Steelers recovered that, and if their offense takes advantage of the field position to score the game's first points so early and in such a way, maybe Lamar Jackson remains the discombobulated player who came into the game with a 1-4 record vs. the Steelers instead of blossoming into the MVP frontrunner he is now.
And if the Steelers had used that as fuel to win for the 9th time in their last 10 games vs. the Ravens, they would have clinched the AFC North Division with two games to go to then have the luxury of fine tuning some things and building momentum heading into the postseason.
But as the idiom goes, "If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, everyone would have a Merry Christmas," and the Steelers had anything but a Merry Christmas during a 3-hour tussle vs. the Chiefs that became disappointingly one-sided. It took some time, but the Chiefs established their superiority partly by taking advantage of situations along the way.
Because Kansas City won the toss and chose to defer, the Steelers offense was on the field to start the game. On a third-and-2, Russell Wilson lost control of the ball in the process of trying to avoid the rush, and that 11-yard loss led to a 40-yard punt returned 25 yards to set up Patrick Mahomes on the Steelers' side of midfield. Three running plays later, the Steelers defense had Kansas City in a fourth-and-1 situation from the Pittsburgh 33-yard line. A 4-yard run by Kareem Hunt moved the chains, and 4 plays later Mahomes completed a short pass to WR Xavier Worthy that became a 7-yard touchdown and a 6-0 lead.
The stretches of complementary football that had characterized the 10-3 Steelers vanished during the slide to 10-6, and the examples early in this game helped Kansas City take control. Corliss Waitman's second punt traveled 58 yards, and a big hit by ILB Mark Robinson on the return had the ball on the grass at the Chiefs 21-yard line. But it was Deon Bush who covered it to save possession for Kansas City. Starting with a third-and-11 from his own 20-yard line, Mahomes completed 3-of-4 for 74 yards, including an 11-yard touchdown to WR Justin Watson for a 13-0 lead.
Again with a chance to display some of that necessary complementary football, the Steelers ultimately came up empty. Starting at their 23-yard line following the kickoff, George Pickens made a nice play on a Russell Wilson deep shot for 41 yards, and then Jaylen Warren ripped off a 22-yard run over left tackle. Two more Warren carries and the ball was in the end zone, but a holding penalty on Darnell Washington took the touchdown off the board. On the next play, Wilson threw into coverage over the middle, and S Justin Reid intercepted in the end zone.
That the Steelers managed a touchdown before halftime and then a field goal in the third quarter was just a tease because Kansas City matched the third quarter field goal and followed it with back-to-back touchdowns, one of which came via a short field after a Pat Freiermuth fumble at the 34-yard line.
"So you can look at it from a lot of angles. The bottom line is junior varsity is not good enough," said Tomlin. "We've got to own that. But we've also got to look at what it is we need to do different. We're not going to continue to do the same things and hope for a different result. That doesn't seem sharp to me. So we're going to take a hard look at this. We've got a couple extra days before we get back into it. We're going to take a look at it and make whatever necessary changes we need to make in the totality of this thing, because again, that doesn't feel good. It doesn't look good. That's just the truth and reality of it."

Bengals are talking about the D, Minkah and Pickens
Steelers.com
The Steelers open the season against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday at Paycor Stadium, a key AFC North game right out of the gates.
"I think every game in this division has that feel to it," said Bengals coach Zac Taylor. "There's not added importance, because they're all important. Your easiest path to the playoffs is to be dominant in your division, so it starts Week 1 with a divisional team at home. We have to take advantage of those opportunities."
The Bengals are coming off an impressive season, winning the AFC and advancing to Super Bowl LVI, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams. They have made some changes in the offseason, but also know they will have to adapt to changes the Steelers made as well.
"Obviously there is the element of unknowns," said Taylor. "They have new players, new coaches. They make tweaks to their scheme. You take that for granted early on that's going to happen and there are some things you are going to have to be ready for, to adjust that maybe you haven't seen on tape. Same with us. It goes both ways."
While the two teams prepare for the game, the Bengals weighed in on the Steelers overall, and also talked Minkah Fitzpatrick, George Pickens and more.
* * * Coach Zac Taylor on if it helps opening the season against a division rival: "There is a lot of familiarity back and forth, from them to us, us to them. It doesn't change the unknown elements, what they might do differently, how they might use their personnel differently. Those are always going to be unknowns. We have a better feel for their personnel, and they have a better feel for our personnel because for the most part it's largely unchanged on both teams. Shoot, their staff has been there for a long time. Guys on our staff have been here for a long time. So, there is a lot of known elements there."
Quarterback Joe Burrow on the Steelers defense: "They have one of the best front sevens in the league. They're going to get pressure on the quarterback. We're going to have a good game plan. I know the coaches are going to put the work in to help us and put us in positions to succeed. It's on us to go out and execute the game plan and the o-line is going to have a tough job. I'm going to have a tough job getting the ball out quickly and finding completions. That front is good."
Taylor on Minkah Fitzpatrick: "Minkah is a great player. He has come in and done a great job taking the ball away immediately when he got to Pittsburgh. That's been his M.O. You can tell he has tremendous leadership qualities. They're able to do a lot of different things with him. Will that change this year, who knows, we'll find out. He's certainly a big piece of their defense. A guy that has been there now a number of years. They have a couple of guys that have been there a number of years. Their key component is their defense. They've been there. They know what their culture is about on defense. They've played at a high level and been a part of a lot of successful teams. I am sure that filters around to guys that are a little bit newer."
Burrow on if it helps opening against a team they are familiar with: "Any time you play a divisional opponent you feel like you know what to expect. They might have some new wrinkles for us, the first game of the year. I'm sure they'll have a good game plan for us."
Burrow on playing an AFC North team: "Any time you have a divisional game it counts as two in the standings. Any time you play the Steelers, Ravens or the Browns you know you're going to want to get that one."
Taylor on rookie receiver George Pickens: "He was a tremendous player in college that we thought highly of. I know that he had a real good preseason, so we have to be ready for him."
Burrow on the revamped offensive line going against the Steelers defensive front: "One of the best fronts in the league. A good test for us Week 1."
Taylor on what the Steelers offense will look like without Ben Roethlisberger: "We'll have to find out when it comes down to it. He did a great job for a long time. It's strange to say that. I remember being in college when he was in college. He was a little older than me, not by much. He was a big part of what they did for a long time.
"They've had a guy (Mason Rudolph) in the system who has been in the quarterback room for a long time. They added a guy (Mitch Trubisky) who has been to the Pro Bowl and been successful. They added a first-round pick (Kenny Pickett) that they've seen play up close and personal for a long time. You have to feel confident they have done everything they can to put themselves in a good position there. I don't know what the offense is going to fully look like with those guys. I am sure there are some things they have withheld that we'll find out about on Sunday."

Trubisky to start vs. Seahawks
Steelers.com
The Steelers open the preseason on Saturday night against the Seattle Seahawks at 7 p.m. at Acrisure Stadium, and it will be the first time one of training camps most interesting battles will be on display in a game.
The battle for who will be the team's starting quarterback when they open the regular season is still ongoing, and on Thursday Coach Mike Tomlin outlined the division of labor for Saturday's game.
Veteran Mitch Trubisky, who was signed as an unrestricted free agent this offseason, will start the game. The rotation will continue with fifth-year veteran Mason Rudolph and rookie first-round pick Kenny Pickett. Tomlin said the two things he is looking for from the quarterbacks is moving the offensive unit and taking care of the football.
"We've got every intention of playing the three quarterbacks," said Tomlin. "How much is to be determined. I wasn't going to be blowing in the wind regarding the quarterback rotation. We've been thoughtful about giving guys an opportunity to work in different groups. Our intentions are to play them this first time out the way we started this process."
Tomlin said he has liked what the quarterbacks have done, and when asked particularly about Rudolph and Pickett, once again said don't read too much into the depth chart.
"They're doing what we're asking them to do," said Tomlin. "They're taking care of the ball and moving their units and they're doing the unofficial things that come with quarterback position in terms of leadership. They're doing a nice job.
"I'll be quite honest with you guys. I only provide depth charts because I have to. That's what this process is about. I think you do this process a disservice oftentimes when you read too much into depth charts at this juncture, particularly when we haven't even been in the stadium yet."
The quarterback position isn't the only spot where rotations will be in effect on Saturday, and Tomlin explained how it will all play out.
"We have a template or framework in which we we'd like to attack this in terms of participation and division of labor. We've got every intention of the first group playing a quarter, the second groups playing the second and third quarter and then the third group playing the fourth quarter. There will be some bleeding, if you will, and the guys, if there's a first teamer that lacks experience, he may play into the second quarter. It there's a third teamer who is on the come with some upside, he might get in the game in the third quarter, things of that nature. It's not going to be hard lines. We're going to do what we feel is appropriate. Our goal is to come out of this game giving everybody an opportunity to show what they're capable of and gain a better understanding of their play under real football like circumstances, and so that's exciting.
"A lot of some of the hard and fast things that you guys might be interested in, as I sit here today, I'm not going to have the answers for. We're highly conscious that we have a practice this afternoon. Every time you snap that ball this afternoon it could change plans. We have a template, and we'll finalize some of those things this evening after we get off this practice field today.
"Today's a big day. I'd be doing today a disservice if I started looking too much ahead. We got a Steelers vs Steelers padded practice today and that's significant. But guys will have an opportunity to show what they're capable of."
LIVE: Coach Tomlin addresses the media ahead of our preseason game against the Seahawks. https://t.co/6jumwLSW6r
After almost three weeks at training camp, Tomlin is ready for that next step, the step that will show him the growth that has occurred since they took the field for camp.
"It is exciting to be at this point of development," said Tomlin. "It's time to get this group in the stadium and compete against some unfamiliar guys. To be in game-like circumstances and have to deal with some of the transitional things associated with play.
"In practices, its game-like. Drills are coordinated and organized. To see their ability to move and function fluidly in the midst of actual play is a significant step. No question the performances under those circumstances are weighted more heavily than they are in these circumstances. We're really excited about that."
While the quarterback position will be one many are focused on, it's not the only area Tomlin will be focused on.
In the return game, the focus will be on Gunner Olszewski, Calvin Austin III and Anthony McFarland Jr. among other specialists.
"The return men. We got a lot of people to look at there," said Tomlin. "The specialists. Got a lot of people to look at there. Game-like circumstances are going to be big for all of those parties as well.
"All of them are viable. We mean what we say when we say we don't care about by what means guys get here. They'll be given an opportunity to show what they're capable of. Return space is a space that history tells me that I'm always open to potentially being surprised. So, I'm excited about it."
More from Tomlin:
On what he is seeing from the running backs in Najee Harris' absence: "I like what they've displayed out here. I'm really interested in watching them in stadium and obviously, ball security is a component of that position that is nonnegotiable. You get those guys in the stadium and you get the chance to see their second effort and the things that you do in game like circumstances, they need to do those things while safeguarding the football."
On if anybody has been ruled out for Saturday's game: "Not at this point. I'm always going to have an inclusive mentality. Obviously, if somebody has missed a significant amount of practice time, I probably won't play them because I'm setting them up for failure. But at this point, all of those that are working and working in some capacity, I'm having an inclusive mentality."
On what he can learn about Kenny Pickett in live NFL action: "A lot. This guy hasn't been in a live pocket yet. None of the quarterbacks have, and that component of it is significant. In terms of their play, their ability to operate and make decisions in a timely manner, their ability to absorb the punishment that comes with the game and the position. There's so much involved in live quarterback play, their ability to protect the football. It's a big opportunity for him and others."

Broncos are talking about Justin, Russ, T.J. and more

The Steelers remain on the road this week, taking on the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High.
The Steelers started the season off with an 18-10 win over the Atlanta Falcons, while the Broncos lost their opener, 26-20, to the Seattle Seahawks.
"Certainly, when we watched this game tape and evaluate the cue, there's a number of things that we'll get cleaned up and corrected," said Broncos Coach Sean Payton. "One of the key things that was important in this game is winning the run game battle, and we weren't able to do that. We struggled and in that inefficiency on first and second down, it was one of our keys to victory and we were anything but. Defensively in the first half we were outstanding, then the third quarter was the flip around quarter. That was when the momentum shifted."
Payton and the Broncos are looking to shift the momentum this week, but they know it's going to be a tough task, especially against the Steelers defense that is ranked third in the AFC and fourth overall in the NFL after one week.
Find out what is being said about the defense in Denver this week and more about what the Broncos are saying about the game.
* * *
Coach Sean Payton on facing stout defensive units in the first four weeks of the season, including the Steelers this week: "I think the No. 1 thing for good head coaches is they're good leaders. Obviously, you can't control if they come from the offensive or defensive side of the ball. (Seahawks Coach) Mike Macdonald Week 1, the tape you're watching, all of that. He's a bright young coach. Week 2 now, Mike 'T' (Tomlin), I've known forever. I don't know that it's looked at differently.
"Certainly, the Steelers defensive tradition and how they've performed over the years is deserving of the accolades and all the success they've had. It's tough, it's physical. They do a lot of things extremely well, and that's not by accident.
"I think we'll be seeing a better defense this weekend, and that's with no disrespect at all to Seattle. It's just a more experienced defense. That's a better way to say it. We'll have to obviously make the corrections and then get ready for a good week here for a home game."
Quarterback Bo Nix on the challenge the Steelers defense presents: "Well, it's definitely a challenge. They have great players. They've been a great defense for a long time. I [have] a lot of respect for them. It's going to be fun playing them for the first time and seeing what it's like."
Payton on the challenge T.J. Watt poses: "I don't get into naming who the top defensive players are, but he's in that discussion. He's certainly disruptive in the run game and disruptive in the pass game. Each film you look at, he's beating doubles. He's very athletic. I think he's very strong, and he can bend. Those are all good traits to have, and he's exceptionally smart."
Receiver Courtland Sutton on facing the Steelers defense and if he knows it could take just a play or two to make the difference: "More than one or two big plays. Any chance I can to go impact the game, whether it's catching however many passes, or catching a big touchdown or getting a key block in on a run play to get one of our backs out in the open. Whatever it may be, my job is to do my job at the highest level I possibly can so that we can have the best success to go win. I'm probably one of the last people that's going to be like, 'It's me, me, me.' It's going to take all 11 of us on the field, and whatever they need me to do in that specific moment, I'm going to go do it.
"If I have to go put my hands on T.J. Watt, then I'm going to go do that. If I have to go run a route and go get open against the secondary, then that's what I'm going to do. Whatever job they need me to do, whatever task they need me to go do, I'm going to do it to the best of my ability so that we can go be successful."
Payton on how the Broncos will prepare for the possibility of facing Justin Fields and what tape they will watch: "I think you study closely the game they just played obviously, preseason. You study the Atlanta cut-ups. Then you understand the skill set he has relative to…you might look at the quarterback run package in Chicago where they went up and played really well against New England after a tough loss on a Thursday night. He played exceptionally well. A lot of QB-design runs. So, you're kind of taking all of that into your cut-up consideration."
Sutton on if he has talked to Russell Wilson this week: "Russ and I have a very good relationship. I'm excited for him and what he has going on in his next part of his journey. Wishing him well, and success and health. Each week besides this one. (laughing)
"It's one of those weeks that he knows what the situation is because he's very similar to myself. He's a competitor. He wants to go out there and be successful, and we want to go out there and be successful. We're going to go out there and compete and tally it up at the end."
Payton on if they will prepare for both Fields and Russell Wilson: "I think you look at Fields last week, and then obviously you prepare for both. Both guys have different strengths. You have a plan for both, but certainly it starts with Fields."
Cornerback Pat Surtain II on his thoughts of who may start at quarterback for the Steelers: "We're focused on the next man up at the end of the day as a defense. That's about it. Focus on the next man up and just prepare for that."
Surtain on what the key is to containing Fields: "With a guy like that we have to make sure that we plaster the receivers and don't allow them to get second chances because we know that Justin creates second opportunities for the receivers and for their offense. When you (have) a dual threat quarterback like that, you really have to lock in and hone in on second play ahead, rather than the first play."
Payton on if coaching Wilson last year will help him anticipate what the Steelers might try and do with him: "No. I don't think so. I mean that. I think every time you have a new system and a new coordinator, I don't think there's really much to that."
Payton on if the team has talked about going against Wilson: "No. We're not playing tennis or golf. We're playing a team game, and we're focused on the Steelers. They're a good football team."
Surtain on what stands out to him about George Pickens: "I think he has elite body control in the air. He can track the ball well. He has great ball skills. He's a playmaker for sure. He's a great player."
Payton on if he has a friendly rivalry with Tomlin: "No, I would say we're friendly though. I consider him one of my—as you do this long enough, pretty soon you're not as familiar with the other coaches that are getting hired. He's a good friend, and he's obviously a heck of a football coach. We didn't play a lot because I was in the NFC and he was in the AFC. He's done a great job there for a long period of time. The most impressive thing you would say is his body of work. We like to use that term—his body of work is really impressive."
Payton on if anyone has talked to Levi Wallace about his experience with the Steelers: "That's a fair question because they're running the same defense. You might ask him about fire-zone rules or certain coverage rules and indicators. That would be much more relevant than having coached a player that's with another team. It kind of comes up week-to-week. In other words, it's not uncommon to have players that were on our roster that are going to be on an opponent's roster. So, you get some, but not a lot."
Offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi on if there is a unique plan needed to stop Watt: "I feel like the last time I was part of playing Pittsburgh, he was hurt that game, which was good for us. He kind of has an Aaron Donald-like effect on the game. There are great players in this league, but there are just a couple guys that I can remember that are as disruptive consistently as this guy. So, you better know where he is every play."
Defensive coordinator Vance Joseph on his relationship with Tomlin: "That's my guy. We've been tight for a long time. To watch what he's done in Pittsburgh that long is impressive. He's a Hall of Fame coach. His teams are always in it, that's impressive. His team will be ready to go on Sunday. Again, it's going to be a tough brand of football. It's always hard to beat him, so I'm looking forward to it."

Tomlin not surprised by Pickett's fourth-quarter heroics
Contributing Writer/Editor
Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin is no longer surprised when he sees quarterback Kenny Pickett put on the Superman cape in the fourth quarter of games.
He's seen it long enough to know that Pickett has an innate ability to up his performance in the game's most weighty moments, including in last Sunday's 24-17 win over the Rams at SoFi Stadium that left the Steelers at 4-2.
In fact, it goes back to Tomlin's days of watching Pickett perform at the University of Pittsburgh.
"His ability to rise up in moments, we valued that in the draft process," Tomlin said Tuesday at his weekly press conference at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.
"That was one of the things that made him attractive to us. I've watched him do it when he was a Pitt Panther. And so I don't know that any of us are surprised by his ability to make the plays that he makes when it really gets thick. I just think some people are built like that. Some people relish the opportunity. Some people really smile in the face of adversity. Some people are competition junkies and I think he's all of those things, but that's not something that we're just discovering. As I mentioned, it's something that we knew."
Pickett completed his final nine passes against the Rams as the Steelers rallied from a 17-10 deficit against the Rams, something that should be familiar to Steelers fans.
Former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had a similar mentality, which led to Roethlisberger posting 41 fourth quarter comebacks in his 18-year career, which ranks third on the NFL's all-time list.
Now in his second season, Pickett isn't anywhere near that level. But he does have five fourth quarter comebacks in his 18 career starts, meaning he has manufactured a fourth quarter comeback in 28 percent of his career starts. Roethlisberger did it in just under 17 percent of his 247 career starts.
Roethlisberger used to joke when asked about his ability to bring his team back that it meant he had played poorly in the first three quarters to put the team in that position.
With Pickett, that joke might ring somewhat true.
This season, Pickett is completing 56.2 percent of his passes with one touchdown and three interceptions and a passer rating of 45.8 in the first quarter of the Steelers' games. In the fourth quarter, his numbers soar to a 73 percent completion percentage for 374 yards, one touchdown and one interception, but a passer rating of 102.8.
Some have attributed Pickett's lack of success early in games to the Steelers' scripting of plays heading into a game. But his effectiveness later in games might at least be partially as a result of the script.
While the Steelers are trying to score off the plays on their script, they also use the script to learn things about the opposing defense.
"We're not completely married to the script. Because some things are sight unseen, like some of the third-down things that the Rams defense was doing in the first half, for example," Tomlin said. "So there's a script we're not completely married to it. … Sometimes it's information gathering. Sometimes it's personnel exchanges, to see how they match personnel or logistically how they deal with personnel exchanges, who's matching up with who, what are good matchups. What are they doing versus certain approaches to football. And so there are many agendas that you're trying to get done in the early stages of the game from a scripting perspective."
Once those opposing adjustments are figured out, the coaching staff can then figure out what adjustments it wants to make or what matchups it wants to create to take advantage of situations.
And that plays a part in some of Pickett's late game heroics.
The Steelers would like to score more earlier in games. But they also know they have late-game Pickett on which to fall back when things don't work according to plan.
"We're going to continually work for more fluid and productive starts," said of Pickett's strong finishes. "But that's a component of it. That's not new."
Cleaning up the penalties: One of the least penalized teams in the NFL this season, the Steelers had a season-high eight in their win over the Rams.
Included in those was outside linebacker T.J. Watt being called for lining up in the neutral zone and unsportsmanlike calls that went against wide receivers George Pickens and Diontae Johnson late in the game.
Tomlin said those mistakes came down to not being aware of the things that referee Craig Wrolstad's crew, which worked the game, would call and how much leeway the crew gives players.
"It's our job to feel the tenor of a crew and adjust our behavior accordingly," Tomlin said. "And we got into that game and that crew had a certain tenor and we didn't adjust to it. And as professionals, that's our job. So, am I worried about those issues being an issue moving forward? No, I'm not. But it is a great opportunity to talk about learning the tenor of a crew. Sometimes, certain crews are more tolerant regarding certain things than others. And that's just the realities of the National Football League. T.J., for example, got a penalty for lining up in a neutral zone in a significant time and the second half of that game on a third-down possession, possession down that we won. A lot of crews will warn you when someone's lined up in the neutral zone or cutting it close from that perspective. Some don't. It's our job to get a sense of how the game was being played that day."
Injury update: Linebacker Cole Holcomb left Sunday's game briefly with an ankle injury but returned and recorded eight tackles, including one for a loss.
Tomlin said Holcomb could be slowed early in the week in terms of practice participation, but should be OK.
The Steelers have two weeks remaining in the practice window to decide whether to activate running back Anthony McFarland from the Reserve/Injured List as he comes back from a hamstring injury.
Tomlin also was asked about the status of defensive lineman Cam Heyward. Heyward has been on the Reserve/Injured List since suffering a groin injury in the team's Week 1 loss to the 49ers but has not had his practice window opened to this point. But Tomlin declined to update Heyward's status at this point.

Hall of Honor: The Steelers will induct four new members into their Hall of Honor at Sunday's game at Acrisure Stadium against the Jacksonville Jaguars as former offensive linemen Gerry "Moon" Mullins and Ray Mansfield, defensive end Aaron Smith and outside linebacker James Harrison will be the latest to receive that honor.
Tomlin coached both Smith and Harrison.
"It's an exciting week for us. (It's) great to be back home and access your stadium this weekend versus a really good football team also, that's really great because we have some Hall of Honor inductees this weekend," Tomlin said. "Moon Mullins and Ray Mansfield, Steeler legends, and a couple of guys that played for me, Aaron Smith and James Harrison. They're really excited about bringing those guys in to their rightful place this weekend and honoring them."
