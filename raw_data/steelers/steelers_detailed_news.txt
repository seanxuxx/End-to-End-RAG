Tomlin on 'great,' Lamar or Derrick, fun
Steelers.com
Q. Tonight's playoff game will mark the fifth time you've coached the Steelers in what was a third meeting in the playoffs against a division rival. What are some of the characteristics of a third game vs. a division rival? A. Obviously there's familiarity, but it doesn't necessarily dictate the outcome or the flow of the game. I just think that with each interaction, the plans and the counter-plans get a little bit more complex. And the way that you manage all of that, all of that video that's reflective of who they are and who you are, combined with the times that you've come together creates an awesome mix that makes strategy complex. Oftentimes I describe it as chess, not checkers, and so I'm always excited about being a component of that. But really it's just reflected in how we position our guys to get the job done.
Q. Is being in the playoffs fun, or does that take a back seat to the pressure to perform and win? A. It is awesome. I think we work 48 or whatever weeks a year for these next 4-to-5 weeks. Professionally speaking, you want to be in the single-elimination tournament. Everybody goes into team development with that mind-set in an effort to be world champions, and so to be a part of that as a competitor – if I had to sum it up in one word, it'd be "fun."
Q. The playoffs in the NFL are single-elimination, do-or-die, there is no tomorrow – pick your cliché. In that kind of a situation, how long can you afford to stick with an individual who isn't playing well before you make a change? A. It depends on the game, on the flow of the game. If a game is close and it's back-and-forth, I think you have more tolerance for decisions that pertain to those things. If the game is not then you've got to move faster. If time is of the essence, you've got to move faster. But I think close football games afford you an opportunity to display patience.
Q. What do you need from your starting quarterback once the schedule flips from the regular season to the playoffs? A. More of the same, just intensified. We've got to be careful as leaders, because people get their tenor from us, and so we've got to be ourselves. But we've got to be our best selves. That's how I talk to the quarterback, or the quarterbacks. My job and the quarterbacks' job obviously have some similarities in terms of the attention and responsibility, and that's the mantra I take, and I share that same perspective with them. I expect them to be themselves, but I expect them to be their best selves, because the guys get a feel for that. It's not a time to get new or brand new. It's more of what we've been doing, obviously at a higher level intensity and with better execution.
Q. Does that go for intangibles, too, because intangibles are a big part of the quarterback position? A. As a matter of fact, that's what I was speaking of. I was speaking of the intangible things, the glue things, the things that brings your unit or the collective together. The encouragement and uplifting of people, the passing of information formally and informally. We just got to be at our best selves, and particularly in those intangible ways, those leadership ways, those glue things.
Q. Are situations like this, games like this, the reason you brought Russell Wilson to Pittsburgh? A. There's no question, because there's no substitute for life experience. And he's a guy who's been there and done that. And there's value in it, not only for him, but also what he can extend to those that he works with.
Q. Are you going to need a player to be great, or do something great, to win tonight? A. "Great" is an interesting term that I often talk to the group about. What defines great oftentimes in our business is defined as being really good, consistently. And so it's not about the individuals, it's about the play-making. Everybody in a helmet has an opportunity to pursue and chase greatness and display greatness. But ultimately, what is great in our business is routinely being really good, and I try to make it that black-and-white for them. T.J. is often described as great as an edge rusher. But what does that mean? It means the consistency in which he shows up in big moments. He's good all the time, and particularly when you need him to be, and ultimately I think that's what defines great in our game.
Q. What I was thinking about specifically was Troy Polamalu in the 2008 AFC Championship Game and his pick-6 at the end. That was a great play, and it iced the game and a trip to the Super Bowl. A. I think oftentimes those moments are born out of people routinely being good. It is a signature moment, if you will. They're deserving of it. It's a culmination of a lot of things, but I don't know that it's something that is pursued. I think doing routine things at a high level positions you for those moments, those defining moments that you get an opportunity to witness. I know when Troy picked that ball off and cut back across that field, and right about the time he went into the end zone, I said, "They'll be playing that the day he goes into Canton." It's cool to be cognizant of those moments when you're watching them, and I've been fortunate enough to be around a lot of those moments over the course of my career. I was an assistant with the Bucs in 2002 when Derrick Brooks picked the ball off and ran it back for a touchdown to seal that Super Bowl. And I felt the same thing as he went into the end zone in that moment. Troy, Derrick, really a lot of similarities in that they were good all the time, and particularly when you needed them to be. And oftentimes the game shines on you and gives you that defining Hall of Fame moment when you're deserving.
Q. In talking about the Ravens defense, you said, "They're using a lot of bogus pressure, and that's a signature of Dean Pees football." What did you mean by "bogus pressure," and what does it look like? A. Bringing a semblance of pressure without the isolation of the one-on-one opportunities in the secondary that often come with pressure. They'll show you a pressure, say bringing the nickel Marlon Humphrey, and usually that means man-free behind it. Dean will bring Humphrey and drop the opposing defensive end into coverage, and he'll still have seven allocated toward coverage. And so he'll have seven people allocated toward coverage, although it might not be the traditional seven. He can still play a variety of zones and man coverages that encompass non-pressures, and that's why we call it "bogus pressure." It's the appearance of pressure, but with seven people still distributed to cover the passing game, and so it is prudently aggressive. That's been one of the ways they have minimized some of the big plays given up over the second half of the year. If you remember, they were giving up quite a few big plays in their secondary during the front part of the year, and that was because they were in isolated one-on-one football behind regular pressure. The presence of Dean when they brought him in as a senior advisor, and his experience and his schematic approach to ball has minimized some of that one-on-one stuff, and thus reduced the number of splash plays or big plays they've given up.
Q. When facing an offense that has Lamar Jackson at quarterback and Derrick Henry at running back, does the defense have to make a choice to prioritize the minimizing of one or the other? A. You certainly do. And then in some instances, you've got to be prepared to deal with both. Particularly in his read-option game, Lamar's running skills are unique. They make you play 11-on-11 football. There's a real black-and-white math component to playing a quarterback with that type of mobility. The bottom line is, if you have a free safety in the middle of the field, 15 yards from the line of scrimmage, you're playing 10-on-11. And so that's what I mean that in some instances, you better choose both. You better get that free safety out of the middle of the field and closer to the action, so that when they choose to utilize Lamar in that way, you have the appropriate number of people to match them strategy for strategy. There's not many ways you can cut 10-vs.- 11 to be effective unless somebody's whipping a block and making a tackle. It is basic mathematics.
Q. In football, there is a phrase "making business decisions" regarding defensive players and how they deal with big, powerful running backs. What does that mean, and in watching video of Derrick Henry, do you notice that happening? A. It's a cute way of saying "turning it down." That is one of the cool industry catch-phrases that simply means people are turning down competition. And there's a fear component that exists certainly. Unique people like Derrick Henry are capable of bringing that out from time to time in some. But I imagine when all the cards are on the table, in environments like single-elimination football, there's not a whole lot of that going on, or even the thought of a whole lot of that going on.
Q. Roquan Smith, Kyle Hamilton, and Marlon Humphrey are the three names that immediately come to mind when the subject is the Ravens defense. But what about their "bigs" on defense? Who among that group is a challenge? A. I think they really distinguish themselves as a collective, and what I mean is they rush well together. You want to be able to identify No. 92 (Nnamdi Madubuike), because of his reputation and what he's done, particularly in recent years, as an interior rush-man. But when I think about him, I think about the (pass-rush) games, the TE-games he runs with No. 53 (Kyle Van Noy). And so when we were talking about them this week, we respect the fact that they're individually talented, but I think the thing that is unique about them is the way they rush as a collective. They do a nice job of keeping the quarterback in the pocket by playing together. And oftentimes, when you don't have people with big-time resumes, like T.J. Watt and Myles Garrett and guys like them, it's easier for the group to buy into the collective component of the rush. I think that's one of the things they've done a nice job of, and it has made them really effective as a collective. Within that you're going to have guys put up big numbers, like No. 53 has big numbers, No. 99 (Odafe Oweh) has big numbers. But when you look at the video of it, you really respect the collective component of how they work.
Q. Are they a 4-3 front or a 3-4 front? A. They are multiple, and they've been multiple for 18 years, the length of time that I've been here. They're capable of showing up in four-down linemen postures. They're capable of showing up in three-down postures. They've always been multiple. When you've got hybrid players like Terrell Suggs … is Suggs an outside linebacker or is he a defensive end? I think a lot of us in this business are still trying to figure that out. But when you've got unique people, position-flexible people, you're able to strike that balance, and that is something they've done as nice a job of as anybody in football for a long period of time, in terms of bouncing back and forth between the two structures.
Q. What are you going to need from yourself tonight to leave Baltimore with a victory? A. I better be willing to display what I ask our guys to display. As the road gets narrow and you get into playoff football, I'm really cognizant of that. It's important that my actions match my words, that they get their tenor from me or the quarterback, those of us who are prescribed leaders within this industry by job title or position. I'm just highly sensitive to that, that my actions are aligned with my words, and that I display the things that I've asked them to display.

The need for speed
Steelers.com
The Steelers are continuing their support of the Girls Flag Football League in Pittsburgh, helping to promote and grow the league during their 2023 season. There are 17 schools participating this year, up from six in 2022, with some of the schools having multiple teams because of the popularity. Throughout the Girls Flag Football season, Steelers.com will be bringing you feature stories, photo galleries and a wrap-up video at the end of the season.
Today's highlight is Sadie Snatchko, who plays for West Allegheny's High Schools flag football team and also is a race car driver at Pittsburgh's Pennsylvania Motor Speedway.
* * *
Name: Sadie Snatchko
Age: 16
School: West Allegheny High School
Grade: 10th
Plans for after high school: I'm going to go to EMT school, then after a year or so of being an EMT, I will go back to school to be a paramedic.
Why did you start to play flag football: Me and my friend, Tati, heard on the announcements at school that there was a jamboree happening, so we decided to sign up. Both of us ended up not going because it was out of our comfort zone but then we decided we'd both sign up for the team and make each other go and try something new.
What do you love about the sport: My favorite thing about the sport is that I get to play with a team. When I race it's just me and the car, but in football I have learned how to play with a team.
How much do you hope for the sport to continue to grow for girls at the high school level: I thought it was cool to be a part of the inaugural season and would love to see the sport become sanctioned soon.
While you're playing flag you are also racing at Pittsburgh's Pennsylvania Motor Speedway. How did you get involved with that sport: When covid first happened the only thing I was involved in was musical theater and it was obviously shut down because of the virus. My parents didn't want me sitting around with nothing to do, so they said I had to find something else to do. At first my mom wanted me to play golf, but I immediately turned that down. Then my dad asked me if I wanted to build a race car and I said sure, so we built one all through the winter and my first season started in May '21.
What are the challenges: There have been many challenges since I've started. In the beginning it was a ton of work for my pap, dad, and myself to get the car ready. Then personally, my biggest challenge was actually driving the car for the first time. I was 14-years-old when I started so I had never driven a car before. Now I struggle with trying not to be overly competitive and as hard on myself.
What is the most exhilarating part of it: Usually I get the biggest adrenaline rushes when it is a super close race between myself and another driver.
How have you fared: I didn't have any wins my first season, but we did some work to the cars before last season and I ended with two feature wins, one heat race win, and six top three finishes.
How is it to compete in a sport like flag football compared to an individual sport: It was definitely a big adjustment going from an individual sport to a team sport. I've had to learn how to work with others and depend on others, where as with racing I was completely in control of the outcome.
What do you enjoy doing other than the two sports: Before racing and flag I was involved in musical theater. I had been in musicals since fourth grade. When I was in middle school, before I became a driver, I was singing the National Anthem at the track. I still do high school musicals and I'll be singing the National Anthem again this season. I also really enjoy hanging out with my friends, sister, and my cat, Whiskers.

Top 2024 Moments: Williams' first catch a big one
Contributing Writer/Editor
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is another in a series of articles looking back at some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
The Steelers acquired wide receiver Mike Williams from the New York Jets on Nov. 5 at the NFL trade deadline.
Just a few days later, the Steelers traveled to Washington to face the red-hot Commanders, who were off to a 7-2 start.
But being new to the team, Williams played sparingly in the game, seeing just eight offensive snaps in the first 56 minutes of the game.
It was his ninth offensive snap that was a game-changer.
Down 24-14 early in the third quarter, after a 1-yard Jeremy McNicholls run, the Steelers answered with a Najee Harris touchdown run to cut the lead to 24-21.
After another Washington field goal to put the Commanders ahead 27-21, the Steelers appeared to be going in for a go-ahead score, but Jaylen Warren fumbled at the goal line midway through the fourth quarter. Washington recovered the loose ball, but the defense forced a three-and-out and the Commanders punted the ball back to the Steelers
On third-and-9 from the Washington 32 with 2:27 remaining in the game, the Steelers called a timeout. Russell Wilson went to Williams and told him to line up on the left side of the formation outside the numbers. Thing was, on the particular play the Steelers were running, Calvin Austin III had been in that spot. But Austin had suffered an injury earlier in the game.
"He said, 'I want you to run this route,'" Williams recalled. "I think Calvin went out. He was running that route all week. He actually ran it earlier in the game. It was for him. He was out, so I went in there and made a play."
That he did.
Wilson dropped back and lofted the ball toward the end zone trusting Williams to get to the spot. He did.
Williams hauled the pass in for his first catch as a member of the Steelers for a 28-27 lead.
"It was a big-time catch by Mike," Wilson said. "I just tried to give him a chance and let him do his thing. The guy had you know, three-plus 1000-yard seasons over his career. A guy whose made plays, a guy who's face adversity. You love it when guys face adversity and they come through on the other end of it."
Damontae Kazee and Minkah Fitzpatrick then stopped tight end Zach Ertz short of the first-down marker on fourth-and-9 at the 50 to turn the ball over on downs.
Wilson then got the Commanders to jump offsides on fourth-and-inches and help the Steelers improve to 7-2 over a Washington team that would go on to advance to the NFC Championship.

The Steelers signed running back Jonathan Ward to a Reserve/Future Contract.
Ward spent time on the practice squad and active roster in 2024, and had five carries for 22 yards in four games.
Ward took part in the Steelers rookie minicamp on a tryout basis and was signed following it.
In five seasons in the NFL, he has played in 47 games, carrying the ball 22 times for 91 yards, a 4.1-yard average. He also has six receptions for 52 yards, an 8.7-yard average, and one touchdown.
Ward originally signed with the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent following the 2020 NFL Draft. He spent two plus seasons with the Cardinals, before joining the Tennessee Titans during the 2022 season. He also spent the 2023 season with the Titans.
Ward played college football at Central Michigan where he played in 42 games, carrying the ball 473 times for 2,539 yards and 28 touchdowns. He also had 98 receptions for 909 yards and four touchdowns.

The toughest of questions addressed again in Indy
Steelers.com
It was "Skill Position Saturday" in Indianapolis.
Quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers were the feature attractions at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Following is a look at some of the highlights of the NFL Network's coverage of Day Three at Lucas Oil Stadium:
QB OR NOT QB, THAT IS THE QUESTION: Kurt Warner won a Super Bowl on the way to the Hall of Fame, but when it comes to evaluating quarterbacks, to projecting which college passers will succeed or fail at the NFL level, even he's not doing anything any better than taking educated guesses.
"I don't know how you do it," Warner admitted.
Added NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah: "It's darn near impossible, especially when you don't know what environment they're going to walk into."
Warner relayed one characteristic of quarterback play he believes can and must translate when transitioning from college to the NFL.
"When I watch tape, for me, the one thing I believe can always transfer is the ability to process," Warner emphasized. "In other words, I look at a play and go, 'OK, how would you read this play?' To see that play out and see the coverages, when you can see a guy do those things consistently, that's where I say, 'OK, I believe that can at least translate to some level.'
"The athleticism part, I don't know. You see some guys that are so athletic in college and you say, 'OK, can it look the same at the NFL level against these better players? Are they that dynamic athletically or not?' I still believe this game is won inside the pocket, so that's how I watch tape. That's the one thing I believe I have at least an idea of how to project.
"But it's very difficult for me to know what these guys can be at the next level and, obviously, why the success rate when you draft these guys is about 50-50. Because I don't think anybody really knows."
LETTING IT RIP: Michigan's J.J. McCarthy, Tennessee's Joe Milton III, Oregon's Bo Nix, Notre Dame's Sam Hartman and Kentucky's Devin Leary opted to put their passing skills on display during the first round of quarterback/wide receiver workouts.
Milton confirmed he brought his cannon with him to Indianapolis.
He delighted the reported crowd of over 16,000 by launching a completion to Mississippi State wide receiver Lideatrick Griffin during a go-route drill that traveled 69 yards in the air.
"When he was throwing these, all the guys had their jaws on the floor," the NFL Network's Peter Schrager reported of the on-the-field reaction of Milton's fellow QBs "They all know that when it came to that drill, Milton was going to blow them all away."
Milton demonstrated an intention to throw with touch as well as rely on his profound arm strength.
"He took some off, especially early," Jeremiah noted. "And then he let the big dog eat a little bit."
NUMBERS GAME: Jeremiah reported the average time in the 40-yard dash of the top 10 running backs in yards from scrimmage in 2023 in their respective Combines was 4.48. The top 10 wide receivers in receiving yards last season averaged 4.47.
COMPARE AND CONTRAST: A standard feature on Combine broadcasts is identifying an NFL comparison for prospects based on physical skill sets and testing numbers.
For Rice wide receiver Luke McCaffrey, the NFL Comp was none other than his older brother, 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who performed for evaluators in 2017 in Indy.
Luke was a little taller (6-foot-15/8 to 5-111/4).
Christian was a little heavier (202 pounds to 198).
Both posted a broad jump of 10'1".
Christian had the better vertical leap (371/2" to 36").
But Luke was a little faster (4.47-4.48).
GRAIN OF SALT: ESPN  personality Pat McAfee's visited Rich Eisen and Jeremiah in the NFL Network booth and acknowledged potential draftees sometimes tell teams what they think the teams want to hear in the interview process at the Combine.
McAfee did more than that when interviewing with Colts General Manager Bill Polian in 2009.
"I just lied to him," McAfee confirmed.
The subject was McAfee's ability to hold for placekicks.
"I was a kicker in college so I obviously couldn't hold for myself," McAfee continued. "A couple people thought I was going to be a punter in the NFL, and if you're a punter you have to hold. Bill Polian asked me, literally, in draft lead up, 'Hey, you've held before? You've practiced before because you knew there was a chance you were gonna have to hold?'
"I said, 'Absolutely, I used to do it like three days a week.' I had never done it once in my life. Then I get drafted, hold for Adam Vinatieri, the greatest of all time. Adam Vinatieri sent me to a holding camp in North Carolina for like four days to learn how to hold, that's real deal. Then that first training camp he threw me no less than 500 balls throughout the day, would come to my dorm room at night, throwing me balls, making sure I'm doing it."
McAfee went on to explain "holding camp" consisted of a few days spent at the home of Ken Walter, who had held for Vinatieri in New England.
"He had a Hall-of-Fame career already established," McAfee noted. "Some lying punk was't going to ruin all that."
ON THE JOB: Steelers wide receiver Allen Robinson was on hand to provide analysis for NFL-Plus.
He was welcomed back to the Combine with a highlight of the 4.6 40 Robinson ran in 2014 prior to becoming a second-round pick of the Jaguars.
"I was a drills guy," Robinson told NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales. "I wasn't a burner, but once we got into the route running, the toe drags, over the shoulder, that was perfectly in my wheelhouse."
Robinson confirmed Dales' suggestion that he's a big fan of Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin.
"'Coach T' is remarkable," Robinson insisted.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Jan. 30
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
JIM MADORMA FROM FT LAUDERDALE, FL: I know the NFL didn't recognize sack statistics until 1982, but is there any way for someone to be able to view films from those games to determine how many sacks L.C. Greenwood had in his career? ANSWER: Once upon a time, the Steelers did a research project on sack totals prior to 1982, and it revealed that L.C. Greenwood had 73.5 sacks, which still has him fifth on the franchise's all-time list in that category. Joe Greene, with 66.0 sacks, ranks sixth on the franchise's all-time list. Greene holds the franchise record for sacks in a game with 5.0, which came in Houston against the Oilers on Dec. 10, 1972; and Greenwood's 4.5 against Cleveland on Nov. 25, 1979, has him tied for second in franchise history with Chad Brown, who did it against the Bengals on Oct. 13, 1996.
DAN CLIFF FROM NORTH CHILI, NY: Going into the offseason with a team that clearly needs help along the defensive line and at wide receiver, as well as starters at running back and quarterback for next season, how do the Steelers stand with salary cap space? ANSWER: I cannot give you an exact number when it comes to salary cap space, and apparently neither can a couple of the websites that track such things across the NFL. Spotrac.com currently lists the Steelers as having $43.3 million in cap space; OverTheCap.com lists the team as having $40.5 million in salary cap space, but having $37.3 million in "Effective Cap Space," which is the cap space a team will have after signing at least 51 players and its projected rookie class to its roster.
CHRIS LIPPART FROM ST. ROBERT, MO: Been reading all these articles about George Pickens and his maturity being an issue. Do you think it would help if he could talk to somebody like Larry Fitzgerald? I always thought it was so classy that after a touchdown Fitzgerald just handed the official the ball, no theatrics. ANSWER: Immaturity issues with wide receivers throughout the NFL go beyond simple touchdown celebrations, and I believe any positive development in that area has to come from within the individual player. Having someone talk to a player may end up working, but I think that only has a chance to work if the individual already has accepted the fact there is a problem and has decided to do something to correct it.
THOMAS WARD FROM LADSON, SC: Thank you for pointing out that Mark Andrews dropping the 2-point conversion wasn't the real problem in the Divisional Round Game between the Ravens and the Bills. Coach John Harbaugh's decision to go for a 2-point conversion the first time he did in that game was totally off base. The score would have been 21-20 with the extra point. If Buffalo then scores a touchdown and kicks the extra point it's an 8-point lead and not a 9-point lead. There was still a full quarter of football to be played. Why don't coaches throw out the analytics garbage and just use common sense and plain old math? ANSWER: I don't have the answer to that, and there is a growing faction within the NFL that has fallen in love with analytics at the expense of – to use your words – common sense and plain old math. I also found it surprising after Bills Coach Sean McDermott saw firsthand how that strategy blew up in Harbaugh's face, he then did the exact same thing in the AFC Championship Game loss the next week in Kansas City.
TREVON SMITH FROM GAINESVILLE, VA: Would the Steelers look into picking up another high caliber player on defense in free agency, someone like Myles Garrett, Nick Bosa, etc.? ANSWER: My sense is that if there is a commitment of salary cap dollars to add a player on defense, the position that individual would most likely be a cornerback or a defensive lineman, not another edge rusher.
JIM SIANIS FROM GREENSBORO, NC: I just read that T.J. Watt has withdrawn from the Pro Bowl due to a lingering ankle injury that he was dealing with during the last few games. So that raises two questions for me. The first is that I don't remember seeing him on the weekly injury report. Did I miss something? The other question I have is what counts as a Pro Bowl on someone's resume? Is being selected all that matters even if the player declines to play? ANSWER: Healthy enough to practice and play down the stretch of the regular season and into the playoffs is a world away from healthy enough for a meaningless flag football game that's essentially a made-for-TV event. Players voted to the Pro Bowl initially as well as those who become injury replacements are considered Pro Bowl players for that particular season.
LARRY HEMINGER FROM SAN DIEGO, CA: Steelers President Art Rooney II said he would prefer to sign one of our current quarterbacks. Seems to me, we would need to know the answer to that prior to free agency and the draft. What are teams able to do between now and free agency in terms of signing players who are set to become free agents? ANSWER: Teams are allowed to negotiate with and re-sign any of their own players who are scheduled to become free agents on March 12 at any time between now and then. After March 12, players who qualify to be unrestricted free agents can sign with any team.
HENRY STURCKEN FROM FAIRPORT, OH: Specifically with Justin Fields in mind, what does the contract process look like? Do all meetings include both the player and his agent? What representatives from the Steelers are there? How many meetings can it take? ANSWER: As a general rule, contract negotiations are conducted over the phone between the player's agent and General Manager Omar Khan. The agent keeps the player apprised of developments, and Khan does the same with President Art Rooney II. And there's no way of predicting how long a negotiation will take before a deal is reached.
RICK CHABOREK FROM WINDSOR, ONTARIO, CANADA: When offensive coordinators or defensive coordinators are offered jobs as happened with Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn of the Lions, will the team let them go even if they're still under contract? ANSWER: Yes. Teams are not permitted to prevent someone from accepting a head coaching position, even if that individual is still under contract.
JEFF BANKOVICH FROM ELIZABETH TOWNSHIP, PA: For the playoffs, what kind of money do the players receive? And for the Pro Bowl, are they compensated? ANSWER: This from BetMGM.com: "For the 2024-25 NFL playoffs, players are paid either $49,500 (Wild Card teams) or $54,500 (division winners) for Wild Card Round games; $54,500 for the divisional round; and $77,000 for conference championships. Players on first-round bye teams receive $49,500 for the Wild Card Round despite not playing in a game." As for the Pro Bowl, last year players on the winning conference received $88,000 apiece and the players on the losing conference were paid $44,000 apiece.
MICHAEL WILLIAMS FROM CINCINNATI, OH: I've heard friends say that the team wearing white in the Super Bowl usually wins – 16-4 in past 20 Super Bowl matchups. What is the Steelers record in the Super Bowl – white jerseys vs black jerseys? ANSWER: The Steelers wore white jerseys in Super Bowl IX, black in Super Bowl X, black in Super Bowl XIII, black in Super Bowl XIV, black in Super Bowl XXX, white in Super Bowl XL, white in Super Bowl XLIII, and white in Super Bowl XLV. That makes them 3-1 in white jerseys and 3-1 in black jerseys.
KEITH MILLER FROM CANTON, NC: It's never too early for fans to start preparing for the draft. Please explain how compensatory picks are awarded for lost free agents? ANSWER: This is from a story in The New York Times:
"Under the rules for compensatory draft selections, a team losing more or better compensatory free agents ("CFA") than it acquires in the previous year is eligible to receive compensatory draft picks, according to the NFL policy. Compensatory free agents are determined by a formula based on salary, playing time, and postseason honors. The formula was developed by the NFL Management Council. Not every free agent lost or signed by a club is covered by this formula. Clubs that suffer a net loss of CFAs during the prior free agent signing period are eligible to receive a corresponding number of compensatory selections. In addition, the formula factors in the value of the free agents lost."

Top 2024 Moments: Two for the Show
Steelers.com
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is another in a series of articles looking back ay some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
The first of three battles with Baltimore in the 2024 campaign came down to a two-point conversion attempt with just over a minute left in regulation.
And, perhaps, a timeout called by the Steelers.
They were playing chess, not checkers, on Nov. 17 at Acrisure Stadium.
"I wanted to see what structure they were in," head coach Mike Tomlin maintained regarding the timeout he opted to call after Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson's 16-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Zay Flowers had brought Baltimore to within 18-16 with 1:06 left in the fourth quarter.
An alternate approach might have been to save all three of his timeouts for a chance at an eventual game-winning field goal had the Ravens tied the game.
But Tomlin was thinking about preserving the lead, not having a chance to break a tie before overtime.
He waited until just before the ball was snapped on the two-point try to call the first of his three timeouts.
The whistles blew but the ball ended up being snapped, and Jackson made a move to his right before realizing the play had been blown dead.
"Thankfully, we even saw some of the semblance of the schematics of what they intended to run," Tomlin continued. "I think that made them change and go the other direction.
"Obviously particularly Mr. (Lamar) Jackson is a little bit less dangerous when he is going to his left than his right. So we're thankful for that."
The Ravens were initially in a formation that included wide receivers Nelson Agholor and Tylan Wallace, tight end Mark Andrews, running back Justice Hill and fullback Patrick Ricard.
The Steelers were in a nickel defense that included safety Damontae Kazee as the fifth defensive back.
When the two teams lined up following the timeout the Ravens had substituted tight end Isaiah Likely for Ricard and the Steelers had switched to their base defense (defensive lineman Dean Lowry replaced Kazee).
"We have two-point plays called," Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said. "We called one, they called timeout, we called the next one."
On the next one Wallace motioned from left to right prior to the snap as Agholor and Likely appeared to be trying to quickly work through some pre-snap confusion.
At the snap outside linebacker Nick Herbig exploded off the ball and got inside of Agholor's attempted block.
Herbig couldn't get to Jackson, who was running left, but he got in the way of pulling guard Patrick Mekari and pulling center Tyler Linderbaum.
That left Jackson 1-on-1 with cornerback Joey Porter Jr., unblocked, as it turned out, on the left edge.
Porter wrapped up Jackson at the Steelers' 7-yard line.
A desperation flip by Jackson landed far short of its apparent intended target, Likely, who had initially helped double-team defensive tackle Cam Heyward before peeling off and attempting to block inside linebacker Elandon Roberts in the end zone.
"It was a QB run," Jackson confirmed. "They just stopped it. They did a god job."
The Steelers registered a first down while making Baltimore exhaust its supply of timeouts on the subsequent possession and then had quarterback Russell Wilson kneel down twice to run out the clock.
"We just understood everybody just do their job," inside linebacker Patrick Queen maintained regarding the critical two-point try. "We don't have to do anything spectacular. Get out there and make a stop. Joey (Porter), who's usually the quiet one, he stopped them and two-point conversion.
"He gave everybody confidence to go out there and get the stop."

Statement from Rooney on Wolfley
Statement from Art Rooney II on the passing of Craig Wolfley
We are deeply saddened by the passing of Craig Wolfley, a beloved member of the Pittsburgh Steelers family. Craig was an outstanding player who brought both toughness and heart to the field during his 10 seasons with the Steelers. As an offensive lineman, his grit and dedication were essential to our success, contributing to the solid foundation of the Steelers' offensive line in the 1980s and 1990s. His work ethic and commitment to excellence were felt both in the locker room and on the field, and his leadership was always evident.
Following his retirement from playing, Craig seamlessly transitioned into a broadcaster, providing insightful commentary and analysis as part of the Steelers Radio Network. His passionate voice and deep understanding of the game made him a trusted figure for Steelers fans, and his humor, warmth, and enthusiasm left a lasting impact on our community.
On behalf of the entire Steelers organization, we offer our deepest condolences to Craig's family, friends, and all who had the privilege of knowing him.

How he fits: Cordarrelle Patterson
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers signed running back/kick returner Cordarrelle Patterson to a two-year contract.
The move comes on the heels of the NFL tweaking its kickoff rules for 2024 to force teams to return more kickoffs. And the Steelers acquired one of the best of all-time. Patterson was voted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame's all-2010s team as the kick returner and has been a first-team All-Pro four times.
Patterson, 33, has an NFL-record nine career kickoffs for touchdowns. Three times he's led the NFL in kick return average and two other times he's led the NFL in kickoff return yards.
For his career, Patterson has averaged 29.3 yards per return on 273 attempts over 11 seasons.
The Steelers have not had a player lead the NFL in kick return average since Rod Woodson (27.3) in 1989.
Patterson also spent the past three seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, playing for new Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith.
While early in his career, Patterson was seen only as a return man with the ability to help out as a wide receiver, Smith unlocked some additional value from Patterson by utilizing him as a running back, as well.

Patterson rushed for more than 600 yards in both 2021 and 2022 before being limited to just over 150 rushing yards in 2023 when the Falcons added running back Bijan Robinson in the first round of the draft.
Patterson also remains adept at catching the ball, hauling in 93 passes over the past three seasons with Smith.
A first-round draft pick of the Vikings in 2013, Patterson (6-2, 216 pounds) ran a 4.42-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine coming out of Tennessee.
He's a hard-nosed runner with the ball in his hands, but has the agility to make defenders miss, as well.
Patterson has caught 298 career passes for 2,795 yards and 16 touchdowns while also gaining 2,511 yards and 22 touchdowns on 514 career carries.
He becomes an immediate upgrade for the Steelers as a kick returner, where the team averaged 23.5 yards per attempt with Godwin Igwebuike and Anthony McFarland handling the majority of those duties. Both are no longer with the team.
In addition to that, he also can potentially serve as the team's No. 3 running back behind Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, while also filling in at times at wide receiver.

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: March 6
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
SUNIL GEORGE FROM PRINCETON, NJ: The Steelers really have not had a slot receiver since JuJu Smith-Schuster. What are the chances that the Steelers will draft a WR who can operate in the slot? ANSWER: Certainly, position flexibility to some degree is important to the wide receiver position in the NFL, but my opinion on the drafting of a wide receiver is that who the Steelers add at that position on the first or second day of picking in April has to be a weapon. A playmaker. The whole package. Because the Steelers already have Calvin Austin III, and I thought he did some nice things from the slot last season. He's a player still very much in development, and he's still operating on his rookie contract. In 2024, Austin played in all 17 games, 8 of which were starts, and he had 36 catches on 58 targets for 548 yards (15.2 average) and 4 touchdowns. His catches accounted for a first down 18 times. With touchdown catches of 55 yards, 29 yards, and 23 yards, Austin showed he can add some ability to make plays down the field working from the slot. Looking at the wide receiver depth chart, it seems to me the Steelers' primary need in the draft is a talent who can be a running-mate for George Pickens. I wouldn't spend a premium draft pick on what I believe you mean when you suggest a "slot receiver."
ELLEN CAUDLE FROM CHATTANOOGA, TN: When a player signs a contract for fully guaranteed money, then he gets injured and hasn't shown that much improvement on the field, is the team still obligated to pay the fully guaranteed amount? ANSWER: When a contract is "fully guaranteed," payment cannot be withheld because of dissatisfaction with performance.
DAVID BARNHART FROM WORTHINGTON, PA: My question concerns the draft. What options does a college player have if he is not selected to attend the Combine, but he does well at the college's Pro Day, and then he goes undrafted in April? When can the team bring him in for a visit? Can he be offered a deal to attend camp? Just how does that work? ANSWER: Given the chain of events you describe, I believe such a player would get signed as an undrafted rookie in the hours after the seventh round of the draft concluded. Draft eligible players who are not drafted become free agents and are able to sign with any team. And there may have been teams that included him as one of their 30 pre-draft visits just based on his showing at his Pro Day to get some more information about him.
KHARI CLEMMONS FROM PETERSBURG, WV: I know that you do not cover the Browns or any other team, but I read on ESPN.com that Myles Garrett has two years remaining on a 5-year deal that he signed in 2020. Was that a misprint? Or is there something about contracts that defy the rules of mathematics? ANSWER: I have no idea what ESPN.com reported about Myles Garrett, but I can tell you that is he is under contract to the Browns through the 2026 season. His salary cap charges are scheduled to be $19.7 million in 2025 and $20.4 million in 2026.
TIMOTHY DOWNEY FROM DERRY, PA: In your opinion, do you think the Steelers are making a mistake by not being more aggressive in trying to sign Justin Fields? There are a few teams with interest that could lure him away. Or do the Steelers feel Fields just doesn't have starting quarterback potential? ANSWER: The Steelers cannot force Justin Fields to sign a contract extension, and he has representation (David Mulugheta) who is trying to get his client the most money he can. In situations like this, it would've been foolish for the player to take himself off the market without at least getting to the legal tampering period, and it wouldn't have been shrewd business for the team to get reckless and overpay before then just to get a deal done. Once the legal tampering period opens at noon on March 10, both sides will have had a chance to gauge the market, and then the real negotiations can begin. Ultimately I see this coming down to the difference in dollars and how the player then views the respective opportunities. Does Fields see value for his career in not having to start all over with a third team, or does he view starting over with a third team to be in his best interests?
WILLIAM YOUNG FROM BADEN, PA: If the Steelers re-sign Justin Fields prior to the start of free agency, do they have to announce the signing immediately or can they wait until after free agency starts? ANSWER: OK, as mentioned in the above answer, the start of the legal tampering period is noon on March 10, and free agency begins at 4 p.m. on Wednesday March 12. If the Steelers re-sign Justin Fields before free agency begins, the deal can be announced as soon as the sides have agreed on terms. It's only if Fields agrees to terms with another team that the official signing cannot happen before the official start of free agency. And there is a very real difference in the eyes of the NFL between agreeing to terms and signing a contract.
EDWARD SWARTZ FROM NORWICH, OH: I read that the Steelers offense averaged 22 points a game in 2024. I remember back when Todd Haley was the offensive coordinator he said in an interview he wanted to score 30 points a game. This got me wondering, what is the most points per game the Steelers averaged in a season, and how did the season end? Also, what is the lowest average points allowed by the defense and how did that season end? ANSWER: The Steelers scored 380 points in 2024, which worked out to an average of 22.4 points per game. The way the Steelers keep teams records pertaining to points scored in a season and points allowed in a season, the rankings are listed by total points, not average points per game.
• The franchise record for points scored in a season is 436 in 2014 (when Todd Haley was the offensive coordinator), and that computes to an average of 27.3 points per game. The 2014 Steelers finished 11-5 and won the AFC North Division; they lost in the Wild Card Round, 30-17, to the Ravens. • The franchise record for fewest points allowed is 117 in 1946, and that works out to an average of 10.6 per game. That team finished 5-5-1 and in third place in the Eastern Conference. • On a side note, the 1976 Steelers allowed 136 points in a 14-game season, which comes out to an average of 9.7 per game. That team finished 10-4 and won the AFC Central Division; they lost the AFC Championship Game in Oakland, 24-7.
MARK RICE FROM LAS VEGAS, NV: Do you think the Steelers are as undecided over which QB they want to sign or re-sign? Or do you think they've known all along and are just keeping it close to their vest for some reason, with a QB signing coming soon? I know I am just a fan. I've been a Steelers fan my whole life. So this indecision on the QB decision from the organization baffles me. ANSWER: I'm trying to be patient here, because I have dealt with this issue in various forms a bunch of times before. Let me start from the beginning, for hopefully the last time. Teams cannot sign any potential free agents from other teams until 4 p.m. on March 12. Teams are able to re-sign their own potential free agents at any time, but those guys will get the right to gauge their value on the open market starting on March 10, which is the legal tampering period. And the most important thing to consider is that IT'S A NEGOTIATION. Both sides have to agree. And since there's a lot of money in the center of the table, why on earth would one side show its cards? To satisfy the fans' right to know? There is no right to know. There's plenty of speculation out there in the ether to entertain you, and when there's something concrete to know you can be assured that information will be all over the place. Patience.
GUILHERME MERTENS FROM FLORIANÓPOLIS, SC, BRAZIL: I am from Brazil, a big fan of this feature, and I don't miss a single edition of Asked and Answered. My question: Do you think it is possible for the Steelers to be designated to play the Los Angeles Chargers in the Brazil game and have 2 International Games? I would love to see that. My only game I saw in person was Chargers at Steelers in 2003. Could you provide some statistics from that game? ANSWER: The Los Angeles Chargers have been designated as the home team for the Sept. 5 game to be played in Sao Paulo as part of the NFL's 2025 International Games. And the Steelers are scheduled to play the Chargers on Los Angeles this season, so that makes it possible. When it comes to what the NFL might decide to do with its schedule I have learned never to say never. But I would hope it's highly unlikely the league would send the Steelers to both Ireland and Brazil during the 2025 regular season.
Back in 2003, the Steelers defeated the Chargers, 40-24, on Dec. 21, which turned out to be the final win in a season that ended at 6-10 for the Steelers. Jerome Bettis rushed for 115 yards on 32 carries (3.6 average) and 1 touchdown; Tommy Maddox completed 11-of-18 (61.1 percent) for 160 yards, with 3 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, and a rating of 128.8; and Plaxico Burress caught touchdown passes of 25 and 16 yards. On defense, Deshea Townsend had a 25-yard pick-6 to help create a miserable day for Chargers quarterback Drew Brees, who completed 16-of-26 (61.5 percent) for 198 yards, with 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions, and a rating of 65.9.

Holiday cheer is in the air
Steelers.com
The holiday season is about giving back, sharing with others, and spreading love and kindness every opportunity.
That is exactly what the Steelers have been doing.
The team hosted their annual Huddle for the Holidays, bringing community organizations to Acrisure Stadium for a night of holiday fun and joy.
Huddle for the Holidays, which is done with Convoy of Hope, has grown through the years into an opportunity for the entire Steelers organization to give back during the holiday season. ( More on Huddle for the Holidays )

Steelers players and coaches have also been out and about all month, making sure the holidays are merry and bright for all as they held their own events.

Coach Mike Tomlin hosted his annual holiday food distribution in conjunction with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, giving back to those most in need during the holidays. He was joined by cornerback Cameron Sutton as they handed out turkeys and all the trimmings and visited with everyone.
DeShon Elliott has made a commitment to giving back to the Pittsburgh community, hosting a back-to-school event, a Thanksgiving event and now helping out at the holidays.
Elliott took a group of middle school students on a holiday shopping spree, letting them choose items that they might not otherwise be able to have this holiday season.
"It's spreading the Christmas cheer," said Elliott. "Not everyone gets the chance to do what I do on a day-to-day basis. When I can give back to the people in my community, people who probably won't be able to celebrate Christmas the way they want to or have never had a chance to enjoy certain things. Situations for everyone are different. It makes me feel good on the inside to give back to the people that matter the most."
In addition to the shopping spree, Elliott also invited the kids to the Steelers Week 18 game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Acrisure Stadium.
Elliott said the spirit of giving back stems from his parents, who do similar things in a quiet manner.
"Every year they choose a random family back home and they buy Christmas presents for the kids, underprivileged kids," said Elliott. "I didn't even know my parents did that. I told my mom a couple weeks ago what I was doing, and she said we've been doing it for eight years. It comes from them."
While Elliott is one who enjoys participating in team community activities, he said having the ability to host his own takes it to another level for him.
"This is my first year doing on my own because God has blessed me," said Elliott. "It feels good and down the line I want to always do it.
"It feels different because it doesn't feel like a like an obligation, it feels like a choice. This is doing it from the heart, and it feels good.
"You don't realize how big of an impact you make on kids. After the fact they might tell a story about how they met you and the impact you made on their lives. You don't realize it at the time, but it can make a big difference."
* * *
There were smiles, laughter and a lot of joy when tight end Pat Freiermuth surprised kids from the UPMC Children's Hospital Family Care Connection Centers with a holiday shopping spree.
The kids were able to pick out toys, games and more for themselves and family members.
"It's special because I get to meet these kids from the Pittsburgh area who love the Steelers and spend some great time with them," said Freiermuth. "I'm able to kind of cheer them up, help them around the holidays, and help some of their families in doing this.
"Everyone wants to be happy around the holidays. So, just to be able to help them and cheer them up and make the holiday something special they can remember."
Freiermuth is a regular at going out with kids to shop, knowing how important it is to not just give back, but be there for the kids.
"Anyone can donate to anything and just kind of like say, 'Oh, I did that. I'm good,'" said Freiermuth. "But just being able to be there, show face and make them smile and help them out. It means a lot.
"I get to put a face to a name for them, and just be proud to be from Pittsburgh and be proud to be a fan of the Steelers."
When the evening of shopping was over, it was hard to tell who had more fun, the kids or Freiermuth himself.
"I think me honestly, just because I get to be able to impact someone's day, someone's month, someone's year, whatever it is," said Freiermuth "It's just awesome to be a part of something special."
Having a warm winter coat is something that seems so commonplace for anyone dealing with the cold months in Pittsburgh, but the reality is there are many kids in the Pittsburgh area who don't have something so simple.
That is why linebacker Alex Highsmith held a winter coat distribution for kids who are served by Urban Impact on Pittsburgh's North Side, the neighborhood that borders Acrisure Stadium.
"I have a good relationship with Pastor Ed Glover and the people at Urban Impact," said Highsmith. "I love the work they are doing on the North Side. So just to be able to give back to them and help them on their mission and what they are doing on the North Side of Pittsburgh, it's an honor for me. I love doing it every year."
For over 25 years, Urban Impact has served the youth of the area, providing services, sports and support.
"What they do with the youth and the next generation is so important," said Highsmith. "My own foundation is centered around the youth too. Just to see their mission to impact lives on the North Side is really awesome. That is what I love about them. They truly care. The people that work there, a lot of them live on the North Side and are doing the work with the kids. That's what I love about them."
Highsmith is thrilled to be able to provide the kids with the winter coats, but he also delivers a lot more…smiles and hope.
"It's so important here to have a good winter coat," said Highsmith. "I know sometimes I take for granted, the clothes on my back. To be able to do this for kids who are less fortunate truly means a lot. A lot of times we take for granted the ways we are blessed. Giving back is so fulfilling.
"When they see you and get excited, it's cool. But when you see the joy on their faces when they pick out a coat, that is what it's all about."
When long snapper Christian Kuntz and his wife, Heather, were thinking about ways to help this holiday season, they wanted to be sure to make their way of giving back was inclusive.
And they definitely achieved that.
The two of them reached out to all levels, from kids to moms, to make the holidays a brighter time.
They kicked it off through their Kuntz4Ki6s Foundation by working with Jeremiah's Place to take single mothers on a shopping trip for necessities and items for themselves. They were also provided holiday gifts for themselves and their children.
"We run our events in the summertime for our foundation, and it's cool to see us being able to do this and give back and especially to single moms that are that are hurting, especially during this time," said Kuntz. "It's special for me, my wife, and my family.
"Not everyone is as fortunate as we are. And for us to be able to give back to them, and to be able to do this in Pittsburgh, in a city that has done so much for me and my family, it's special."
They continued the holiday spirit by hosting a toy distribution at Pittsburgh Grandview PreK-5, bringing joy to kids at a time of year when joy should be widespread through a partnership with Toys for Tykes.
"Being able to give a kid a toy that may not have the opportunity to get toys on Christmas, and being able to provide that for them, it's special," said Kuntz. "I know we want to focus on essential needs and things that people need. But just seeing kids smiling, getting toys, it's really exciting.
"The best part of it all is just the kids face and how happy they are when you give them a toy or something. That's the best part about giving back. Just seeing their reaction, the pure joy and the fact that they really need what we are giving them."
They wrapped up their holiday good will by hosting teens from the Foster Love Project to dinner and a night of fun and games at Dave & Busters. The couple also provided gift cards for the kids so they can do some of their own holiday shopping.
"This was fun, and I did my best to not let them win against me," said Kuntz. "I am competitive for sure. But it was fun, being able to enjoy a meal together and then let the kids have fun and play games.
"My foundation, when we started it, our hope was to help the youth. And it just kind of came together where we wanted to find a way to kind of touch every aspect that was important to us.
"I grew up with two older brothers that guided me, and I followed them and everything they did. So, I want to act as a big brother to other teens that might not have someone to look up to. It's just that connection of having someone in a position that you can look up to and it's special for us to do it. It means a lot."
Giving back all year is nothing new for defensive end Larry Ogunjobi, as the Steelers 2024 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year nominee has a heart of gold.
But at the holidays, he always makes sure he kicks it up a notch, assuring that those who need a little something special are well taken care of.
Ogunjobi took youth from the programs at the YWCA and Urban League in the Pittsburgh area on a shopping trip, making sure they get to enjoy the blessings of the holiday season like others.
"It's funny, because I was talking to some friends and it doesn't matter what kind of day you're having or what's going on in your life personally," said Ogunjobi. "When you help people, you always feel better afterwards.
"Doing this shopping trip, it just kind of made me really put things in perspective and realize that I'm in an amazing position and God has blessed me in so many ways. It's about not having any bad days and being able to really help those in need. That's what I enjoy doing."
And he did just that. Ogunjobi was smiling and laughing with the kids as they picked out items for themselves, but also didn't forget their loved ones as well.
"The kids at the start, they didn't know what they were getting, what was actually happening," said Ogunjobi. "When you see their face and they're just super excited. And then you see them shopping.
"The kids were shopping for other people. And it really touched my heart because it's a moment that obviously they can do whatever they want for themselves. But almost every kid was getting something for their mom or sister or grandparents.
"It just showed people have a heart."
Ogunjobi also hosted a dinner at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center for families who have resettled into the Pittsburgh area recently. He also provided them with gift cards to help with some of the basic necessities they need to adapt to their new life in Pittsburgh.
Ogunjobi worked hand-in-hand with Hello Neighbor, a local organization that works to improve the lives of recently resettled refugee and immigrant families by matching them with dedicated neighbors to guide and support them in their new lives.
Ogunjobi understands what it's like for families that are immigrants to the United States based on his family history. Ogunjobi's parents moved to the United States from Nigeria in 1993, a year before he was born, to help provide a better life. He knows that families can struggle with receiving the basic necessities to help rebuild their life.
"It's just all about giving back," said Ogunjobi. "It's what we all should do.
"My parents came here with nothing. They built a life here, moved here to get a better life. I want to make sure I am able to give it back because my parents instilled such a good example in me of that."
Tight end Darnell Washington has a passion for helping those who have served or our currently serving our country in the military, especially since his brother, Ezekiel, is a United States Marine.
That is why Washington worked with Dreambuilders Foundation to take two families from the Veterans Leadership Program shopping for Christmas gifts.
Washington surprised the families with the $1,000 shopping spree for each, joining them to select Christmas gifts for the family.
"For me, it was very special," said Washington. "The families didn't know what was going on at the time, so when I walked in, they were really surprised. I walked into where they were and handed them the gift cards, and I could see the smiles on their faces right away."
Washington understands the importance of giving back, especially this time of year when families are struggling to make ends meet and provide a happy holiday season for their kids.
"I feel like that is more important," said Washington. "Everybody talks about giving back to their community, but doing it and experiencing is so much better. It was amazing. I doubt they even knew who I was. And it doesn't matter.
"For me it was about seeing the smiles on their faces and kicking off the holiday so on Christmas they can say they received something."
Washington brought his family with him to be a part of the shopping experience as well, loving the aspect of seeing firsthand the impact that can be made.
"That was my first event that I did on my own, so for me to experience it like that, I was excited," said Washington. "It made me want to do more. Everybody can always do more in their own community to make something happen. Me just doing that, it makes me want to do more and put more smiles on people's faces."

Rookie Recap: Nick Herbig
Steelers.com
Going into the 2023 season, the thought was rookie linebacker Nick Herbig would be a contributor on special teams, but his impact beyond that wasn't yet determined.
The fourth-round pick out of Wisconsin wasted no time letting it be known there was more he could do.
He finished the season with 22 tackles, 15 of them solo stops, and three sacks for a loss of 24 yards. He also had five tackles for a loss, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery.
Herbig also added five special teams tackles, four of them solo stops.
"I learned a lot this year about who I am on and off the field," said Herbig. "I have taken a lot from T.J. (Watt), Alex (Highsmith) and M.G. (Markus Golden). I learned a lot from them. I had a lot of fun out there for sure."
Herbig stepped up big when there were injuries, or just when Watt or Highsmith needed a breather. His progress throughout the year was noticeable, and his snaps grew along with that progress.
Herbig came up with one of the biggest defensive plays of the game for the Steelers against the Seattle Seahawks in a crucial Week 17 win, even though he only played two defensive snaps in the game.
In the fourth quarter, with the Steelers leading, 27-20, Herbig sacked Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith, stripping the ball from him and coming up with the recovery at the Seattle 16-yard line. The Steelers converted the turnover into a field goal to extend the lead, 30-20.
"From Day 1, Coach (Mike) Tomlin has talked about the standard is the standard. We even have shirts that say that," said Herbig. "When I have guys like T.J., Alex and Markus in front of me, and I hear my number called, I have to make sure the standard is the standard. T.J. and Alex have been making those plays all year. I have to uphold that standard as well."
Watt has enjoyed being there for Herbig, including after the rookie didn't know what to do once he made the strip sack against the Seahawks.
"It's funny because after the fact we talked about it, and it's those first big plays of your career. I've talked about it a lot as you black out," said Watt. "You don't really know what's going on. You're just so excited. You have so much emotion. So, I was just trying to coach him through it all. Let's hit the handshake quick. Let's have some fun. He was kind of running all over and I was like all the cameras are over here. Let's go over here and I was walking through the process of the whole thing."
Watt loves seeing the success all of the outside linebackers have because he sees the work they put in on a daily basis.
"You know how much work he's put in," said Watt. "You guys see all the reps we put in before and after practice. That goes for all the outside linebackers. When that feeling pays off and you get home and you're able to make a huge play, it's an addictive feeling and I'm glad that he got a taste of it and you continue to strive to do that more.
"When anybody makes a play, specifically a guy in our room because I see the amount of work and I see all the things behind the scenes that go into those big plays. None of that stuff just happens by chance. There's so many reps that go into it that make those plays.
"When you get that opportunity, you seize the moment. It's a heck of a play on his part."

Steelers name Alexander defensive backs coach
Steelers.com
The Steelers named Gerald Alexander the team's defensive backs coach.
Alexander is no stranger to the Steelers coaching staff, having spent two seasons (2022-23) as the assistant defensive backs coach with the team, before leaving to become the safeties coach for the Las Vegas Raiders in 2024.
In two years in Pittsburgh he worked with a secondary that recorded 36 interceptions, which was tied for second in the league. In 2023, the defense held opponents to a 84.7 passer rating, whcih was 10th best in the NFL.
In Alexander's first year with the Steelers, he worked with a secondary that was tied for first in the NFL in interceptions with 20 in 2022. Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick finished that season with a career-high and NFL leading six interceptions while earning first team Associated Press All-Pro honors.
Prior to his first stint with the Steelers, Alexander was the defensive backs coach for the Miami Dolphins for two seasons (2020-21). Under his leadership, the defensive backs tied for first in the NFL in interceptions with 18 in 2020, while cornerback Xavien Howard had 10 interceptions and was selected first team Associated Press All-Pro for the first time.
Alexander broke into the coaching ranks on the college level as an undergraduate assistant at Arkansas State in 2013 and then a graduate assistant at Washington in 2014. He also spent time as a defensive backs coach at Indiana State (2015), Montana State (2016) and California (2017-19). During his time coaching in college, he held NFL two minority coaching internships, with the Tennessee Titans in 2015 and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2016.
During his time at Cal, Alexander worked with All-Pac-12 defensive backs Ashtyn Davis and Camryn Bynum. Davis went from a walk-on to a third-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft by the New York Jets while Bynum was selected in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. Cal also led the Pac-12 in and ranked second nation-wide with 21 interceptions in 2018.
Alexander also spent five years playing in the NFL after he was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He spent time with the Lions (2007-08), Jacksonville Jaguars (2009-10), Carolina Panthers (2010), Miami Dolphins (2011) and New York Jets (2011). He appeared in 44 games, starting 30, and finished with 154 tackles, 116 of them solo stops, 14 passes defensed, four interceptions, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and two sacks.
Alexander, who is from Los Angeles, played college football at Boise State.

URL: https://www.steelers.com/news/heyward-is-the-heartbeat
CONTENT:
There are so many adjectives that have been used to describe Steelers defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, but his teammate and fellow defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi might have nailed it better than anyone ever has.
"His energy, his passion, his approach to work," said Ogunjobi as he started to describe Heyward. "He's a guy that never really has a bad day regardless of what's going on.
"He always just puts his best foot forward and he's an integral part of the defense.
"He's the heartbeat."
The heartbeat.
That's not something that is thrown around lightly, as it comes with responsibility, passion, love and desire for the game of football.
But it's exactly who Cameron Heyward is.
The heartbeat of the 2024 Steelers.
When told of the description, Heyward smiled. How could he do anything but smile.
"I take pride in it," said Heyward. "But as a heartbeat, you don't have to see me, you've just got to feel me.
"The work's got to be displayed and I want to make sure I do my part."
There is no doubt, Heyward has been felt this year and is absolutely doing his part. He had one of his best regular seasons, showing that there is no slowing down for the 14-year veteran.
"Cam's a heck of a player," said outside linebacker T.J. Watt. "No surprises out of all of us in this locker room because I've seen how much he's worked since I walked in the door here, and I think he's having a heck of a season.
"It seems like he's like wine and he gets better with age."
Heyward turned 35 last May, the second oldest player in the Steelers locker room, behind only quarterback Russell Wilson, who turned 36 in November.
He has heard the jokes from Coach Mike Tomlin, referring to him as the 'old man.' It motivates the heck out of him, gives him a little chip on his shoulder that pushes him every day.
"It's poking and prodding the bear," said Heyward. "The way I look at it is, I'll be the old man if I'm staying upright and delivering. They've got to find something to keep poking and prodding about.
"I love having the chip on my shoulder. I play my best ball when I feel like everybody's against me and everybody's counting me out."
There isn't anybody in the Steelers locker room who has ever counted him out. Last season Heyward had what he described as a disappointing year, appearing in only 11 games as he dealt with a groin injury. He struggled with the injury all season, trying to recover on a weekly basis.
But in 2024, he was stronger than ever, with whispers of Defensive Player of the Year surrounding him.
"It's just impressive to see a guy that's in his 14th season playing at such a high level," said safety Minkah Fitzpatrick. "It's good to have him out there wrecking games like he does."
One of his toughest critics, who doubles as one of his biggest fans, his younger brother Steelers fullback Connor Heyward, loves what he has seen.
"It's not even real sometimes playing with him, but also seeing him play at this level," said Connor Heyward. "The level he is playing at this year, wow.
"I woke up the morning after the second Browns game and saw that he had eight sacks for the year at that point. I was just like, dang. But it just goes to show the work he puts in."
It's work that is raising eyebrows around the NFL, and younger brother is hearing that from others.
"Dirty Red (Tyler Matakevich) and I, we were on the sideline talking during a game," said Connor Heyward. "He was like, 'Connor this is Cam's best year.' And it's not like he was saying that his other years weren't good.
"I'm happy for him. He takes everything seriously like he always does, but just doing it 10 times more. His massages, Pilates, doing a lot of stuff at a higher rate because when you're injured, you've got to do stuff times two.
"He's getting older, but his play is rising. I think he just wants to show everybody that he can play at this level coming off his injury last year and being the leader he is.
"And, he wants to be a leader, but also being a leader that produces. Sometimes there's leaders that don't produce. He's a leader that produces and it means a lot to him still to be able to play this game. He's not just doing it for a check. He loves this game. He wants to win the Super Bowl ultimately.
"He wanted to prove everybody wrong and come back even stronger. This is a league where everybody plays at a high level. There are young guys that are coming in fresh. He wants to keep playing and make his mark and be one of those guys who is a Hall of Famer at the end."
To get to where he is now, though, he has had to make some concessions. And it hasn't been easy for someone like Heyward, who takes pride in setting the example and being one of the hardest workers on the team.
There are days, and they have become more and more frequent, where Heyward is listed on the injury report as did not practice/resting vet.
"I think it's important that he gets the rest," said Fitzpatrick. "It's him listening to his body. People say you have to stay moving to stay young. But at this point you are just trying to get to game day.
"Sometimes practicing can beat you up. He's been doing it for a long time. I don't think a Wednesday practice makes his game that much better."
It's something he fought for a while when Tomlin told him he wouldn't be practicing, but he knows it's best for him and he has finally relented.
"That is a Coach T thing with the rest component," said Heyward. "I've been more open than in years past trying to sustain and trying to stay up and it's paying off. But I had to adjust to that. That was something I wasn't used to.
"I had to switch things up during the week from a preparation standpoint, really hone in on technique on my own or stealing reps during our walkthroughs. Trying to do things on the side because I'm not getting those physical reps.
"I understand when the games are. I'm getting paid for the games, but I'm trying to make sure I sharpen my tool every week.
"My film work has kicked up a lot. I have been taking more out of my walkthroughs, more out of our meetings, and those are the things I've got to hang my hat on right now."
There isn't a day that goes by that Heyward doesn't take a look at the six Super Bowl trophies that welcome every player, coach and staff member as they enter the office area at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.
Heyward can't miss them, as the library where they are immaculately displayed is located right outside the defensive line/defensive team meeting room.
"Every single day when I walk in our meeting room, which is right next to those trophies, I look over at them," said Heyward. "I think that's by design where they are.
"I think you learn to understand the history here, understand that the six trophies represent a lot of blood, sweat and tears that went into winning them."
Heyward has put in his share of blood, sweat and tears through his 14 seasons of wearing the black and gold.
But there is still one thing that is missing. One thing that he is yearning for. One thing that he would give anything for.
Adding another trophy to the display with his name on the side of it.
"Especially at that age where he's done a lot of great things, he's got a lot of accolades, I think the greatest one he wants right now is that Super Bowl," said Ogunjobi. "Football is the ultimate team sport and when you care about the team as much as he does, you see why he would want to get the Super Bowl.
"He has such dedication and a will to work and win. He's always been a player and a person that has a desire to be great. It's less about the accolades and more about his legacy. He takes that very seriously. So just in his work and his approach to how he does certain things, you can feel and see the result of that."
As the Steelers embark on their playoff run, there is nothing he wants more than for it to end hoisting a Lombardi Trophy, a new one for the trophy case that he can look at on a daily basis.
"There's a hunger and starvation there," said Heyward. "That's what you get measured for here, those six Super Bowl trophies. You better be jealous of that. You better be hungry for that, because the history of this organization was made off Super Bowl wins. It's made off guys having deep playoff runs and answering the call."
Heyward is ready to answer the call.
"It pushes me," said Heyward. "Whether it's my kids being bluntly honest and telling me that I don't have one of those or whatever it is. I want to put an exclamation point on my career."
There is no question Heyward is his own worst critic. He wants to play better tomorrow than he did yesterday, and that's something that is always a driving point.
"I've always been a guy that's got something to prove," said Heyward. "I've always been the guy that I need to prove to the masses that I belong and show the job is not finished."
At this point, one would assume that Heyward has proven himself.
There isn't any reason to think otherwise.
Unless you think like Cameron Heyward does.
"No, I haven't proven anything," said Heyward.
And he means it.
"There's a lot more to accomplish," said Heyward. "And my goal is to exceed what everybody else thinks about me."
Those thoughts are pretty high, especially from an organization that signed Heyward to a new three-year contract before the start of this season.
It's a contract that will help him fulfill his desire to be a one-helmet player.
It's not common to spend an entire career with one team, as free agency has players spending their careers with two, three and sometimes even more teams.
Heyward is the exception to the rule.
"It means you're doing a lot of things right," said Fitzpatrick, who started his career with the Miami Dolphins before he was traded to the Steelers. "It means that you're a guy that's just wanted by this program.
"I think that's something a lot of those guys, one helmet guys, pride themselves in for sure."
There is no doubt, it's something Heyward prides himself on. He is happy where he is and had no interest in trying something new.
"The new contract gave me the opportunity," said Heyward. "That was the whole thing with the contract. I just wanted an opportunity to continue to be here.
"I enjoy wearing that emblem on my helmet. I don't want to go anywhere else. I don't want to have a different emblem because there's a lot of pride in what you do.
"If you go somewhere else, you've got to restart, and it takes away from the glory that can come from playing at one place."
That isn't what Heyward wants. What he wants is the Lombardi Trophy that has eluded him so far in his career.
"What I want my legacy to be is the goals people set for me weren't enough to match the goals I set for myself," said Heyward. "And hopefully I hit all my goals before I hang it up.
"And a Super Bowl trophy, that's the goal."

Khan: Getting QB situation settled a priority
Contributing Writer/Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - After the Steelers lost their final five games, including a playoff defeat at the hands of the Ravens, Steelers general manager Omar Khan said Tuesday the team has plenty of work to do this offseason after that disappointing finish.
That process begins to heat up this week at the NFL Scouting Combine, as the Steelers get a look at the 329 prospects on hand here at Lucas Oil Stadium.
And with just two weeks until the new league year begins March 12, the clock is ticking on some important decisions the team needs to make moving forward in an attempt to correct the issues that derailed the Steelers in 2024.
"The way we ended was unacceptable," Khan said Tuesday of the team's finish in 2024. "I'm just as disappointed as everyone else. And I can tell you we are working hard to fix that and make sure it doesn't happen again."
The first step in that process will be figuring out who the team will have at quarterback in 2025.
All three quarterbacks – Russell Wilson, Justin Fields and Kyle Allen – the team had on its roster in 2024 are scheduled to become unrestricted free agents March 12, and Khan said getting at least one or perhaps some combination of those players under contract before then is a priority for the team.
"We went into this understanding that we had three quarterbacks in the last year of their deal, and here we are," Khan said. "Until we get one of those guys, or two of those guys, or some combination of them signed, all options are on the table. We have had conversations with both Russ' people and Justin's representatives, and we'll see where that goes."
Wilson and Fields combined to start all 17 games for the Steelers in 2024, with Fields starting the first six games while Wilson recovered from a calf injury and Wilson handling the duties after that.
The Steelers acquired Wilson, 36, at the start of free agency a year ago, while Fields was brought in via a trade with Chicago after the team dealt Kenny Pickett to Philadelphia.
"We would like to sign one of the guys that we had last year, but the reality is, they're both free agents," Khan said. "So until we get one of those guys under contract, you know, all options are on the table."
That would include exploring options for trades or signing another veteran starter in free agency because who the Steelers have at quarterback will affect other decisions the team makes this offseason.
Because of that, Khan would rather have a quarterback signed sooner rather than later.
"It's an ideal scenario you'd like to have this done before, before the start of the league year," Khan said. "Obviously, that impacts who you sign, impacts the type of receiver you may go after or how you build the rest of the team. So all that has an effect."
Wilson, 36, completed 63.7 percent of his passes and threw for nearly 2,500 yards in his 11 starts, tossing 16 touchdowns with five interceptions. He also ran for two scores.
Fields, who turns 26 March 5, had 1,106 passing yards and five touchdown passes with one interception in his six starts, also rushing for five scores.
Bringing at least one of the two back would allow the Steelers to have some continuity after completely swapping out their quarterback room before the 2024 season.
"You don't want to go with three new quarterbacks every season," Khan conceded. "That's not ideal, but that's just really where we're at right now. You know, since Ben (Roethlisberger) retired a couple years ago, he was our franchise guy for a lot of years. And until we have that right person there, it's hopefully not like that. But we're going have to have to have some flexibility."
What the Steelers do at quarterback also affects what they might do in terms of their own roster.
Khan said he had a good exit meeting with wide receiver George Pickens, who blossomed as the team's No. 1 wide receiver in 2024. Pickens is entering the final season of his rookie contract.
"I can tell you that he has a desire to be great," Khan said. "He has a desire to be great here. We have a desire for him to be great and to be great here with respect to the contract. But you know, we won't discuss that publicly, and usually those things are addressed at a later date."
Khan also said he has had talks with the agent of pending free agent running back Najee Harris about a possible return, while he expects fellow running back Jaylen Warren, who is slated to be a restricted free agent, to return in 2025.
That said, one of the deeper positions in the 2025 NFL Draft is running back.
"It's a good running back class, for sure," Khan said. "It's an exciting group. We haven't closed the door on Naj. We have had conversations with Doug Henderson, his representative. So all options are on the table."
The Steelers also have some potential losses coming in free agency, as well.
Two of the team's opening day starters on their offensive line, left tackle Dan Moore and right guard James Daniels, are slated to become free agents March 12. But having selected five offensive linemen in the past two drafts, Khan feels they have potential options already on the roster to replace those players.
Broderick Jones, a first-round pick in 2023, has started the past two seasons at right tackle, but will be given a shot at left tackle in 2025.
"I'd say it's a safe assumption that going into this you know that he'll be the left tackle," Khan said.
Meanwhile, 2024 fourth-round draft pick Mason McCormick moved into the starting lineup early in the season when Daniels suffered a torn Achilles' tendon and held down that spot.
"It was awesome," Khan said of McCormick's rookie season. "Mason came in, a small-school guy. This was not too big for him. And I love his progression. And I think the future is bright for him, and he gives us good options at the position."
The Steelers also would like to beef up their defensive front, especially after being gashed for 299 yards in their playoff loss to the Ravens.
"We know we weren't good enough down the stretch," Khan said. "Fortunately, we have the resources from a cap standpoint to address and maybe in free agency. And, there's maybe some trade candidates out there. And this draft is a really good draft for the defensive line."

5 for Friday: Steelers count on improvement from young OL
Contributing Writer/Editor
One of the keys to the Steelers' 2025 season will be the improvement of the team's young offensive line.
In the past two years, the Steelers have selected offensive linemen Broderick Jones, Spencer Anderson, Troy Fautanu, Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick in the draft.
All are 24 or younger, with Jones and Frazier being the youngest at 23.
With Dan Moore scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins March 12, there is a good chance that at least four of the offensive linemen the Steelers have selected in the past two drafts will have a chance to start next season, with veteran guard Isaac Seumalo being the fifth starter.
With so many young players in that group, it's not surprising that there were some struggles in 2024. In fact, the Steelers had four different players – Frazier, Fautanu, Anderson and McCormick – make their first career NFL starts during the first six weeks of the season.
"We absorbed a lot of attrition during the course of the journey," Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said at the end of the season. "We ended up playing a lot of young people. They responded in a real positive way, but maybe they fatigued, mentally and physically."
There's also the possibility that as opposing teams saw more on tape of the young players, they developed a plan of attack to take advantage of some of the things they didn't do quite as well. Oftentimes for young players, the adjustments to the adjustments that opponents make after seeing them play help determine their long-term success.
But one of the biggest jumps a player makes in his career is from his first NFL season to his second. That is largely because the player now knows what to expect from the grind of an NFL season and how to prepare his body for that.
It's one of the biggest reasons for their improvement. But beyond that, they also get stronger and are better mentally prepared because they aren't learning a new scheme.
Players are allowed to get better from year to year. In fact, if they aren't improving, they probably won't be around very long.
Given the age of the group as a whole, the Steelers should benefit from that up front on their offensive line in 2025.
"Hopefully the offensive line is a strength going into the future," team president Art Rooney II said last week.
There's good reason to believe that will be the case.
• One of the public misconceptions regarding the NFL is what constitutes a long-term plan. It's different in the NFL than it is in other spots, largely because careers are so short.
Look at the NFL Draft as an example.
NFL teams sign their rookie draft class to four-year contracts per the Collective Bargaining Agreement. For first-round draft picks, the teams get a fifth-year option, but because of the new CBA signed in 2020, even that has changed.
Given how fifth-year options are now tied to the top average salaries at each respective position instead of draft position, fewer fifth-year options are now picked up than prior to the signing of the new CBA. For the 2021 draft class, for example, just 17 of the 32 players selected in the first round had their option picked up. Under the old CBA option rules, the number of fifth-year options exercised was usually around 20 or more.
And over the past few years under the new CBA, the majority of free agent contracts signed have been of the shorter variety as opposed to the four- and five-year deals that used to be the norm.
Two years in the NFL is now a long time. Three seasons is almost an eternity. Four is a generation.
Consider the Steelers' offensive line as an example.
In 2021, the Steelers' starting offensive line from left to right was Moore, Kevin Dotson, Kendrick Green, Trai Turner and Chuks Okorafor.
Moore was the only one of those players still with the team in 2024 and is now a potential unrestricted free agent.
Things can change rather quickly.
Star players obviously stick with their respective teams longer, but on average, NFL rosters see a turnover of 40 percent from year to year. So, a long-term plan in the NFL is really a two-year plan.
• With the Super Bowl now complete, the rush toward the 2025 season now begins in earnest for all teams. In two weeks, the NFL will descend upon Indianapolis for the annual Scouting Combine.
The league also will officially announce the 2025 salary cap at some point during the next couple of weeks, as well.
March 10, the NFL's legal tampering period begins with the new league year starting March 12. All teams must be salary cap compliant by that point and free agency then begins.
The Steelers currently have 22 players set to become unrestricted free agents, including several starters, running back Najee Harris, Moore, wide receiver Van Jefferson, guard James Daniels, linebacker Elandon Roberts and cornerback Donte Jackson among them.
That number also includes all three quarterbacks, Russell Wison, Justin Fields and Kyle Allen, who were on the roster in 2024.
They also have a restricted free agent in running back Jaylen Warren.
Some of those players will obviously be re-signed by the team. But on average, an NFL roster sees about 20 or so new players from year to year.
That's why one season isn't a carry over into the next. When 40 percent of the roster is different, it's just not the same team.
• Some people were upset that Baltimore's Lamar Jackson was voted first-team All-Pro at quarterback, but Buffalo's Josh Allen beat him in the voting for NFL MVP.
The two things are not one and the same.
A player can be first-team All-Pro and not be the most valuable player in the league.
It's actually similar to how the Steelers players voted for their team MVP in 2024. Cam Heyward and Chris Boswell both were named first-team All-Pro by the group of people who vote for those awards. T.J. Watt was voted second-team All-Pro.
But when it came time to tabulate the votes for team MVP, Watt's teammates chose him over Heyward and Boswell. Heyward and Boswell both would have been fine choices, as well, but Watt's teammates felt he was the more valuable player.

By the same token, even though Allen's numbers weren't quite up to par with those of Jackson, the league's voters felt Allen was more valuable or important to his team's success.
Jackson had the better numbers. Allen was more valuable. It's not that hard to understand.
• Concussions decreased 17 percent in the NFL in 2024 compared to 2023 and were down 12 percent from the average from 2021 to 2023.
The totals, which include concussions suffered in the preseason and regular season, is an all-time low since the league began tracking head injuries in 2015.
Use of the Dynamic Kickoff Rule reduced concussions on kickoffs 43 percent. Returns also increased 57 percent from a historic low in 2023. There were seven kick returns for touchdowns, the most since the 2021 season.
There also were seven returns for touchdowns in 2024 after there were just two in 2023.
It's not a perfect solution. The new kickoff rule isn't wildly exciting. And it's still so different that there's still a lot of analysis that needs to be done to perfect it.
But it probably isn't going anywhere given the decrease in concussions.

How he fits: Quez Watkins
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers signed former Eagles wide receiver Quez Watkins in free agency, adding another veteran to their group.
A player whose game is predicated on speed, Watkins ran a 4.35-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine coming out of Southern Mississippi University in 2020.
He also had a very solid 36 ½-inch vertical jump and 10-5 in the broad jump, which helps show just how explosive a prospect he was.
In four seasons with the Eagles, Watkins caught 98 passes for 1,249 yards and 6 touchdowns, largely serving as Philadelphia's No. 3 receiver behind A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith. His best season came in 2021 when he caught 43 passes for 647 yards and one touchdown. He had an NFL-best 91-yard catch that season against the 49ers.
In his career, Watkins has appeared in 49 games, starting 25.

Watkins (6-0, 193 pounds) has aligned both in the slot and outside, but has more experience working in the slot. In his career, 64 percent of his snaps have come out of the slot, with the other 34 percent coming on the outside.
He's excelled at getting yards after the catch. Of his 1,249 career yards, 513 have come after the catch, and he averages 5.3 yards after the catch per reception.
Watkins will join a wide receiver group that also has seen the Steelers add Van Jefferson in free agency. They will compete with a group that includes Calvin Austin, Marquez Callaway and Denzel Mims as players with NFL starting experience.
"We have some players we feel good about," said Steelers GM Omar Khan. "I think one thing about it, and I don't want to speak for our coaches specifically, but I think they will do things and adjust things based on who the receivers are at that position."

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 4
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
JOE RILEY FROM ROGERSVILLE, MO: Do you think there is any hope of the Pro Bowl being played as a four-quarter game again? ANSWER: There is a level of violence inherent when football is played, and with that comes some level of a threat of bodily harm, threat of injury. I don't believe you're ever going to be able to convince the best players in the NFL to participate in a meaningless game where they could sustain an injury that conceivably could shorten or end their careers. Football without hitting is bad television, and the Pro Bowl ratings were suffering as the game was evolving more towards what it is now, which is flag football. I cannot see it going back to that.
ELLEN CAUDLE FROM CHATTANOOGA, TN: Why doesn't the front office of the Pittsburgh Steelers listen to what the fans want? I know that they are the professionals, but some of their decisions just baffle the fans. They don't give a detailed reason for their decisions. ANSWER: I'm going to try to be as respectful as possible as I answer this, but what business on this planet – and every team in the NFL is a business – polls its customers before it's making decisions, or as it's making decisions? Take the store where you shop for groceries as an example. Would that store poll its customers before adding an item or discontinuing an item? Before setting its prices? Before deciding whether to be open for business on weekends? Involve its customers in its hiring and firing decisions? Imagine if the Steelers polled the fans before making every decision. Free agents to sign, and the amount of those contracts. Players to draft. Cutting the roster. Picking a starting quarterback. Deciding if/when to bench the starting quarterback. As a fan/customer, you have every right to vote at the cash register, and by that I mean the right to decide whether or not to spend your hard-earned money on the product. Beyond that, I'm sorry but fans don't deserve to be involved/polled in the franchise's decisions.
MARK RICE FROM LAS VEGAS, NV: If the Steelers are interested in re-signing Russell Wilson, or Justin Fields, what is taking this long to sign one of them? ANSWER: Taking so long? You're talking about contracts that will end up being multi-year, multi-million-dollar deals. Taking so long? Seriously? The Steelers have exclusive negotiating rights with all of its own players until the start of the legal tampering period, which is on March 10. Today is Feb. 4. Do you think the agents for those two players are going to take the first offer? If it was your agent, would you want that? Or maybe you think the Steelers should just start out with a ridiculously high number to get it over with so that you wouldn't think it was taking too long. To steal a line from John McEnroe: "You cannot be serious."
LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM. PA: How much is Russell Wilson set to make on the open market as an unrestricted free agent? I saw Justin Fields is around $6.4 million a year, but is Russell's age playing a factor on his next price tag? ANSWER: There are no such numbers for what Russell Wilson and/or Justin Fields are "set to make on the open market," at least no such numbers that have any basis in fact or reality. What you're reading are projections, estimations, which are synonyms for guesses. Stop wasting your time with that kind of garbage, because it's simply click-bait.
CHRIS BILLINGHURST FROM MAIDENHEAD, UK: Following up on Michael Williams' question last week regarding Super Bowl jerseys, it was my understanding that the AFC team gets the choice to wear their home uniform for even numbered Super Bowls, whereas the NFC gets the choice for the odd numbers. Do you know why the Steelers wore white jerseys in Superbowl XL, and black in Super Bowls X and XIII? ANSWER: The way it works is that one year the NFC is the designated home team in the Super Bowl and the following year the AFC is the designated home team in the Super Bowl. And it's the designated home team that gets to choose which color jersey to wear. In Super Bowl IX, the Vikings were the home team, and they chose to wear purple, and so the Steelers wore white. In Super Bowl X, the Steelers were the home team, and they chose to wear black. In Super Bowl XIII, the Cowboys were the designated home team, and since the Cowboys' preferred jersey color is white, they chose to wear white which left the Steelers in black. In Super Bowl XL, the Steelers were the designated home team, but they chose to wear their white (road) jerseys, because the team squeezed into the 2005 playoffs as the No. 6 seed, which meant they opened on the road vs. Cincinnati in the Wild Card Round, then advanced to Indianapolis in the Divisional Round, and then played the Broncos in Denver in the Conference Championship Round. In keeping with the theme of "road warriors," the Steelers chose to wear their white jerseys vs. Seattle in Super Bowl XL.
EVO HERNANDEZ FROM MEXICO CITY, MEXICO: Why do the Steelers select after the NFC South Division Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2025 NFL draft if the teams have the same record of 10-7? ANSWER: According to operations.nfl.com, "In situations where teams finished the previous season with identical records, the determination of draft position is decided by strength of schedule — the aggregate winning percentage of a team's opponents. The team that played the schedule with the lowest winning percentage will be awarded the higher pick." Because the Steelers played a tougher schedule than the Buccaneers, Tampa Bay picks ahead of Pittsburgh.
BILL MALONI FROM CHEVY CHASE, MD: I've seen various and conflicting accounts of when the Steelers draft in 2025. Beyond having the 21st overall selection in Round 1, how many picks do they have now? ANSWER: The Steelers have 7 picks in the 2025 NFL Draft. Those break down to 1 pick in each of the first 5 rounds, and then 2 picks in Round 7. Once compensatory draft picks are awarded, the draft slots in Rounds 3-through-7 will be assigned by the league.
JON SPROUL FROM PORT SAINT LUCIE, FL: With respect to the kickoff rule change, have any kickoffs been returned for touchdowns this past season? ANSWER: There were 7 kickoff returns for touchdowns during the 2025 regular season. The players who did it were Arizona's DeeJay Dallas, Cincinnati's Charlie Jones, the Jets' Kene Nwangwu, Seattle's Laviska Shenault Jr., the Giants' Ihmir Smith Marsette, Dallas' Juanyeh Thomas, and Dallas' KaVontae Turpin.
JED SMART FROM EUSTIS, FL: Another question about Pro Bowl pay. T.J. Watt was selected to this year's Pro Bowl, and for whatever reason, bowed out. I understand he's still credited with being selected, but does he, or others who get replaced, get paid for being selected? ANSWER: When it comes to the Pro Bowl, you have to play to get paid.
LEON KULINSKI FROM OIL CITY, PA: I read where guard James Daniels was very highly rated for his performances before he got hurt. As he is a young veteran I think the Steelers would benefit from bringing him back although everything I read seems to be that he will sign elsewhere. Would like your thoughts on this issue. ANSWER: James Daniels, who will be 28 in September, tore an Achilles on Sept. 30 in a game vs. the Colts in Indianapolis. I cannot imagine a realistic scenario in which he would be able to pass a physical when free agency begins on March 12, and so I have no idea what kind of market there might be for Daniels. Before the 2024 season even began, the Steelers had used a fourth-round draft pick on Mason McCormick with the idea that he would step in at guard once Daniels hit unrestricted free agency, and I see that as the most likely way this situation plays out.

Overcoming adversity is nothing new for Trice
Steelers.com
Overcoming adversity is nothing new for Steelers cornerback Cory Trice Jr.
Evidence of that is symbolized by the tattoo emblazoned across his chest.
"Only the strong survive."
It's a sentiment that has been a part of his life, his journey through football and beyond.
"I have seen guys go through adversity and just quit," said Trice last spring. "I have seen guys go through adversity and never come back. I knew with what I went through in football and life, only the strong survive.
"You have to be strong in faith, with your spirit and have a strong support system around you. You are going to go through tough times, and you want to make sure you have the right people in your corner."
Trice didn't know when he uttered those words just how meaningful they would be as the 2023 Steelers season approached.
Trice tore his ACL in practice during training camp at Saint Vincent College last year, just months after he was drafted by the Steelers in the seventh round of the 2023 NFL Draft and just weeks before he was to play in his first preseason game.
It was heartbreaking, but he knew there was only one option.
Survive.
Keep in mind, this is a guy who had to fight back from a torn ACL while in college at Purdue. And it's the same guy who lost his father, Cory Trice, Sr., who was shot and killed when his son was just 10 years old.
If he survived that, he could get through anything.
And he did.
And his teammates noticed. So much so they voted him the Steelers recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award, given to a player who has shown courage either coming back from an injury or a life-altering situation.
Trice was honored at the Arthur J. Rooney Courage House Luncheon on Tuesday at Acrisure Stadium, which benefits Holy Family Institute. In addition, Chasiti Strickland, a alumnus of Holy Family, was the recipient of the Arthur J. Rooney Sr. Courage House Award.
Coach Mike Tomlin was on hand to present the award to Trice, as he witnessed first-hand how he battled adversity.
"This guy faced a great deal of adversity in a short period of time in his career," said Tomlin. "I've been on my job a long time, and unfortunately, I've seen a lot of talented young people get hurt in their rookie training camp. And in most cases, that is their story. You fight to come back from injury, but when you have no resumé to come back to, it makes it doubly challenging. From the moment this young man got hurt, I was just really impressed with his mindset, how strong he was in rehabilitation, how he worked to stay connected to his group, the defensive backs and the football team, how staying engaged allowed him to continue to learn.
"As he went into training camp this year, he wasn't functioning like a rookie. He deserves a lot of credit for that. He positioned himself for the bounce back. I don't know that any of us are surprised about the plays that you mentioned (in his video). As a matter of fact, we're excited about the many more that await him, because he's not only talented, but he's proven that he's got the intangible qualities that you need to sustain in this business and be the type of player that he desires to be and we want him to be."
While winning an award for overcoming an injury isn't what players strive for, Trice does appreciate that his teammates saw the work ethic he put forward.
"It's special to win something like this, but going through what I did wasn't as bad as what most people on the outside think and what it looked like to them," said Trice. "It was tough, I am not going to lie. But I was just so focused the whole time on making sure when I came back, I was going to make plays and show them that I belong."
It was the support system around him, including family, teammates, coaches, and in particular Coach Mike Tomlin, that helped him get through the toughest times during his battle with the injury and his fight to come back.
"Being around the guys and having Coach Tomlin dropping nuggets on me every day, telling me to find out more about myself, bringing me along and keeping me up to speed with everything," said Trice. "There was a lot of stuff that Coach T was doing that was so helpful. He always says stuff at the right time. Those little messages he always throws out, you've just got to dissect them and really hear what he's saying. It meant a lot. And all the other coaches and players, having me around and filling that void of being sad."
What Trice found out about himself is while he is strong, he still needed some fine-tuning in different areas to get through the latest challenge.
"I found patience. I found more grit. I had to find myself in a lowkey manner," said Trice. "Whenever I thought I couldn't take any more, I just showed myself that I could keep going no matter what.
"I always knew I was strong. I didn't know how strong I could be. But, as I keep going through this life thing, I definitely continue to find out how strong I am.
"I had to keep my head down and keep working and staying on course. Keep trusting my work, keep trusting in the coaches and just keep putting my best foot forward every day."
And after his injury, he took putting his best foot forward to heart every day. When last season ended, and players headed home for the offseason, Trice kept working. When the offseason program ended late spring, Trice stayed in town and kept working. When there was nobody in the building at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, Trice was there. "It actually wasn't hard to do that," said Trice. "I'm fresh out of college and I don't want to go back home. I'm in the NFL, and I've got to make sure I'm doing everything I can to put my best foot forward. That was me being here for the whole summer. It was cool because I knew how I was going to be in the season, so that's all I was thinking about, honestly."
The hard work and sacrifice Trice put in all offseason paid off when he was cleared to practice during training camp and was back in full swing, returning to the field to play in the regular season. It was joy for him.
"It was actually wonderful. It was a cool experience," said Trice of returning to the playing field. "I definitely enjoyed it. It's really just a testament to the work that all the guys put in, including me. All the work we put in during camp and stuff. For me to get back on the field with those guys that I grinded with was a blessing. For me to go out there and make plays, just be out there, is a testament to the work we have been putting in all summer."
It appeared that Trice was fully on the road to his return until the Steelers played the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 3 of this season. Trice suffered a hamstring injury and landed back on the Reserve/Injured List.
It could have crushed him, but he didn't let it.
"It's just part of the game," said Trice. "You got to take what comes with the game and be able to bounce back. Sometimes you can't control what happens.
"I was ticked for sure. I'm ticked off that I just got back and that happened. But you get to a point where you understand things and you understand life and you realize that you can only do so much in this situation. The only thing you can worry about is getting better, getting back."
And getting back is something that could come sooner rather than later. Trice has returned to practice, opening a window for him to return from the Reserve/Injured List and back on the field.
"I definitely want to get back out there and ball out with the guys," said Trice. "It's time for me to be called up. I just love being out there with those guys."

Rookie Recap: Cory Trice Jr.
Steelers.com
His rookie season wasn't anything close to what cornerback Cory Trice Jr. anticipated, spending the entire year on the Reserve/Injured list after the promising cornerback was injured in training camp.
Trice, who was selected by the Steelers in the seventh round of the 2023 NFL Draft, the 241st overall pick, was a player the coaching staff was excited about right out of the gate.
"He played a lot of press coverage and that's huge," said secondary coach Grady Brown following the draft. "Just the way that he plays press, being able to go down and not play a motor technique, not back up, really just use that frame to just take up a lot of space and make guys work on the line of scrimmage.
"Really excited about getting him in here. He has some toughness. He started his career off as a safety. A high school basketball player. So just a lot of good things just from a coaching standpoint to work with and we're looking forward to getting him in here."
Trice is likely to come back even stronger in 2024, ready to tackle whatever is ahead of him.
He has a tattoo that says, "Only the strong survive." It's a tattoo he got before he came to the Steelers, one that tells the story of his journey, which included a serious injury at Purdue, and how he always fought through adversity.
"It was just about my time at Purdue, about where I came from and surviving adversity," said Trice after he was drafted. "I have seen guys go through adversity and just quit. I have seen guys go through adversity and never come back. I knew with what I went through in football and life, only the strong survive.
"You have to be strong in faith, with your spirit and have a strong support system around you. You are going to go through tough times, and you want to make sure you have the right people in your corner."
I’ve always believed in the big picture, that’s why i be on my day to day grind 🔄
Don’t compare me to no other 🤬.. if they went through what I went through, they would’ve been folded… #thankyoulord #AGTG ✝️ pic.twitter.com/TbL0J3gBij

How he fits: Dean Lowry
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers have signed veteran defensive lineman Dean Lowry as a free agent.
Lowry, 29, is entering his ninth NFL season, having spent his first seven seasons with Green Bay and 2023 with the Vikings.
The 6-foot-6, 296-pound Lowry was a fourth-round pick of the Packers in 2016 out of Northwestern who has started 84 games and appeared in 120 in his career.
Lowry is an athletic end with good length. He ran a 4.87-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2016 and also posted a 7.26-second three-cone drill and 4.38-second 20-yard shuttle, all of which are excellent for an athlete of his size. He also had 30 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press.
At the NFL level, Lowry has been a highly durable defensive end in Green Bay's 3-4 defense before moving on to Minnesota in 2023, where he played more defensive tackle.

He had never appeared in fewer than 15 games in a season before injuries limited him to nine games in 2023, four of them starts.
Converting back to a 3-4 defensive end for the Steelers should be right up his alley.
While not a dynamic pass rusher – he has 15.5 career sacks – Lowry has been an above-average run defender for much of his career.
With the Steelers, he'll add veteran depth to a defensive front that includes Cam Heyward, Larry Ogunjobi, Keeanu Benton, DeMarvin Leal and Isaiahh Loudermilk, helping offset the loss of Armani Watts in free agency.

5 for Friday: Can Steelers improve more than rest of division?
Contributing Writer/Editor
In the past two offseasons, the opening days of free agency has brought the Steelers the likes of linebacker Patrick Queen, safety DeShon Elliott, linebacker Elandon Roberts, guard Isaac Seumalo and quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Justin Fields – though Fields was acquired via a trade – among others.
They've been aggressive in filling their needs – particularly aggressive considering their past.
Thing is, the Steelers have been that aggressive in free agency the past couple of seasons because they had the available salary cap space. And this year, according to numbers released by the NFL earlier this week, the Steelers enter free agency – which begins with the legal tampering period Monday and officially kicks into full gear Wednesday – with the seventh-most available cap space, nearly $60 million, among all 32 teams.
So, while all teams got a bump last week in cap space when the league informed teams what the 2025 salary cap would be, the Steelers didn't need to necessarily concern themselves with the actual cap. They already knew they would be under.
As we've already seen this week, a number of teams across the league are not. Players are getting released left and right by teams working to become cap compliant. Contracts are being adjusted, which is great for the player, who gets a big check instead of having to wait for it. But the team owner has to write that big check as opposed to paying it out over the course of the season.
And it also simply pushes the player's future cap hit higher, which the Browns have done several times to their own detriment with quarterback DeShaun Watson – something the Browns did again this week in an effort to get under the 2025 salary cap. At some point, the bill comes due.
Per OvertheCap.com, which tracks such things, the Steelers currently have the least amount of "dead money," cap space paid out to players no longer on the roster, of any team in the NFL entering the 2025 season at less than $50,000.
On the opposite end of that spectrum is San Francisco, which has nearly $66 million in dead money counting against its cap and you see the difference.
The Steelers currently have freedom to improve their roster that few other teams in the NFL possess.
And they've largely mined free agency well, signing outside free agents to shorter-term contracts that don't hamstring the franchise in future years, while also getting players who have contributed in big ways.
They haven't all been hits, but nobody bats 1.000 in free agency or the draft for that matter.
But with what look to be very solid drafts in back-to-back seasons, the team has set itself up for continued improvement in 2025. Even at positions where they might lose someone in free agency this offseason have been addressed in the draft in the past couple of years. There are young players waiting in the wings as replacements.
Baltimore can't say the same in regard to offensive linemen Ronnie Stanley and Patrick Mekari, both of whom are among the team's players slated to hit unrestricted free agency next week. And the Ravens, as of Thursday night, only had $12 million in available cap space.
Cincinnati has more with $52 million, but a large portion of that will be eaten up when wide receiver Tee Higgins' franchise tag goes on the books. And there's also a Ja'Marr Chase extension looming.
Add to that the team agreed to allow defensive end Trey Hendrickson to seek a trade on Thursday, and it wouldn't be surprising to see the rest of the division take a step back in 2025.
The Steelers, meanwhile, figure to improve.
• Steelers fans should be cheering for the likes of Dan Moore, James Daniels, Najee Harris and others to get big contracts elsewhere if and when they're not re-signed by the Steelers.
With some of those players – and potentially at least one quarterback – likely to sign elsewhere, the Steelers can play the compensatory pick game this offseason if they work things well.
That's where players who have been released since the end of the season can come into play.
Because of the rules involved with compensatory picks, players who are released by another team and signed by a new one don't count against the signing team's compensatory formula. Players whose contracts expired with their old team do.
So, if weighing Play A, whose contract has expired and is a true free agent, versus Player B, who was released by his former team, Player B just might have a little more value to a team that is in line to lose to players who should be starters elsewhere. They very well could net the team that loses them a compensatory pick or two.
And the bigger the contract signed by the team that loses the free agent without making subsequent forays into free agency, the better.
So don't hate on, for example, Moore getting a big deal elsewhere. It's both good for him and also might be good for the Steelers, especially now that compensatory picks can be traded.
• Since the loss of Ryan Shazier to a career-ending injury at the end of the 2017 season, the Steelers have headed into the offseason every year in search of potential replacements for the Pro Bowl linebacker.
They have run through the likes of Jon Bostic, Morgan Burnett, Devin Bush, Marcus Allen, Avery Williamson, Robert Spillane, Joe Schobert and Miles Jack, among others, in an attempt to replicate the production or flexibility that Shazier gave them.
In Queen and Payton Wilson, a third-round draft pick last year, they finally seem to have finally gotten it right. Add to that the fact that Cole Holcomb, who appeared as if he might be an answer two years ago before suffering a season-ending injury, will be back in 2025, and the Steelers seem to be reasonably set at the position.
In fact, this will be the first offseason since Shazier suffered his tragic injury that the Steelers won't head into the offseason searching for answers at inside linebacker.
They tried free agency. They tried the draft. But seldom did they do both.
Last year, they did both, and it finally worked out.
• Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Pittonline@iheartmedia.com
• It's mock draft season, especially now that the NFL Scouting Combine has been completed. But remember that the mock drafts you see now become completely moot over the next couple of weeks.
For example, earlier this week, Chicago made pre-free agency trades to acquire veteran guards Jonah Jackson from the Rams and Joe Thuney from the Chiefs.
Pretty much every mock draft that has become available in the days, weeks and months leading up to those acquisitions had the Bears taking an offensive lineman with their pick in the first round.
Chicago could still do that, but it's more likely the Bears just opened up their draft board to any number of possibilities by adding two veteran players to their line.
That's what will be happening across the league over the next few weeks. Teams with major needs will fill them in free agency, shuffling the way the draft may fall.
• One other thing to keep in mind as we get closer to the draft is that just because this web site or that website has a certain player ranked somewhere doesn't mean that's how NFL teams view him.
At this point, no player is rising up or down on the draft boards of actual NFL teams – at least not ones that know what they're doing.
The only "boards" on which players are making massive moves are the ones of the draft analysts who are late to the party or don't have the same amount of information available to them that teams do.
And in this year's draft, which isn't deep at the top of the first round in terms of having sure first-round picks, there's a good chance we'll see some players go in the first round that were unexpected by the analysts as well as some "first-round talents" that fall into Day 2.
Once you get past the first 10 or so picks this year, the next 50 to 60 players will have similar grades. And beauty and need will be in the eye of the beholder.

Johnston signed to three-year contract
Steelers.com
The Steelers signed punter Cameron Johnston to a three-year contract.
Johnston, who is entering his seventh season in the NFL, spent the last three years with the Houston Texans. He entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 NFL Draft, spending three seasons there.
Johnston has played in 95 games, punting 445 times for 21,029 yards, a gross 47.3-yard average, with a net average of 42.4 yards. He has downed 182 punts inside the 20-yard line. He has hit a punt of at least 60 yards in each of his first six seasons.
Johnston appeared in 13 games in 2023, punting 66 times for 3,145 yards, a gross 47.7-yard average. He downed 30 punts inside the 20-yard line, an impressive 45 percent. He nailed a 74-yard punt in Week 8 against the Carolina Panthers, punting from his own end zone for a career-long, and the longest in Texans history. He punted in both of the Texans postseason games last season, averaging 46 yards in the AFC Wild Card win over the Browns, and 43.4 yards in Divisional Round loss to the Ravens.
In 2022 he led the AFC and tied for second in the NFL with 37 punts inside the 20-yard line, tying a career-high he set in 2021. He ranked first in the AFC with 42.05 percent of his punts landing inside the 20-yard line, and fourth best in the NFL. It was also the fourth highest single season mark in Texans' history. His 42.6-yard net average ranked second in the AFC, while his 48.1-yard gross average ranked third in the AFC.
While with the Eagles he finished fourth in the NFL in punting yards (3,318) and net punting yards (2,2924) in 2020, as well as tying for sixth in the NFL in punts inside the 20-yard line (26). Johnston set single season Eagles' records in gross punting average (48.1) and net punting average (42.7) in 2018.
Johnston played four seasons at Ohio State where he was named Big Ten Eddleman-Fields Punter of the Year and was a second-team All-America selection his senior year.
He also attended St. Joseph's College in Newtown, Australia and took part in the Melbourne-based punter/kicker training ground Prokick Australia and was a former Australian Rules football player for Melbourne Football Club.

Watt: 'I want to be a Pittsburgh Steeler'
Steelers.com
You could hear the disappointment in T.J. Watt's voice when he talked this week.
It was noticeable, because Watt so desperately wants to do something he hasn't done yet in his career.
Win a playoff game.
"We need to win football games and find ways to stop the run and play effective defense and go from there," said Watt. "But I don't have all the answers as we sit here right now as to what needs to change."
It's the same feeling Watt had last year after the Steelers lost to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card round, a game Watt didn't play in due to a knee injury.
The feeling, though, doesn't change.
"It's tough to sit here, same time as last year, the same scrum and same questions. And I have the same answers," said Watt. "Obviously, I'm very frustrated with how things ended. And that's not just with the last game. That's the last month of football.
"It's a collection of things and it starts with myself, and I need to play better. We need to play better. There's not one thing that needs to be fixed here. There's a lot of things. But it starts internally with myself. I need to play better in bigger moments. And it'll be a long offseason to have to sit with that."
Watt, who has a remarkable ability to make big plays at key times, didn't come up with as many big plays down the stretch as opposing offenses scheme to find ways to take him out of the game.
"Teams are playing certain ways and chips and stuff like that and getting the ball out quick," said Watt. "I need to be more open to moving around more and trying to affect games as much as possible. You guys know I want to affect the games more than anybody, but I don't want to selfishly take another guy's spot, go to a different spot where I feel like I could have a better rush.
"I definitely feel like schematically it's been a tough year for how the offensive scheme things to try to get me out of the game. It's going be a big break down for me to try to find ways to make plays. I'm not making excuses for myself at all. I want to make plays. I need to find ways to continue to win off of chips and slides and things of that nature. And I'm going to work tirelessly this offseason to get that sorted out."
Watt started every game at left outside linebacker this year, and said it's a position where he does feel the most comfortable. But he also has moved at times.
"I move around from time to time, but primarily the left. I prefer the left," said Watt. "But at this point in my career, I want to be an impact player. I don't want to be schemed out of games. I want to be able to deliver the football and good field position, or take the football away.
"It wasn't a good enough year for myself when it comes to that."
With the way Watt talks, you would think he didn't have another strong season. But he did.
He was voted the Steelers Most Valuable Player for a record fifth time this year and also selected to the Pro Bowl Games and was selected second-team Associated Press All-Pro.
Watt started all 17 games, finishing with 61 tackles, 40 of them solo stops. He had 11.5 sacks, 19 tackles for a loss, 27 quarterback hits, six forced fumbles, four passes defensed, three strip sacks, and two fumble recoveries. He is the only player in the NFL that ranks among the top six in the League in strip sacks (t-1st), forced fumbles (1st), quarterback hits (6th), fumble recoveries (t-7th), sacks (8th) and tackles for loss (2nd) in 2024.
Watt recorded his 100th career sack against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 5 of this season, on a night he accounted for one and a half sacks.
Watt became the second fastest player to reach 100 career sacks, doing it in 109 career games. Only Hall of Famer Reggie White did it faster, reaching the 100-sack mark in 96 games. Watt is also one of only three players to reach 100 career sacks before the age of 30. He is the Steelers all-time sack leader with 108 career sacks, third-most in NFL history by a player in their first eight seasons in the NFL.
He wants more, and he wants to do it right in Pittsburgh. Watt will be entering the final year of his contract in 2025 and wants to stay put.
"I want to be a Pittsburgh Steeler," said Watt. "I don't want to leave this place. I want to be part of the solution. I've put so much into it here. I want to help Cam Heyward get to where we need to get. I want to be a part of the solution.
"I don't want to leave this place. I love the people here. And that goes beyond just the coaches. It's the fan base. It's the people, the community. And we owe it to them to get it right. And I want to be part of the solution, not leave here and go somewhere else.
"That's not my intention at all."

5 for Friday: History could be on side of Steelers
Contributing Writer/Editor
Familiarity with divisional opponents is what makes for many of the great matchups that go into those games.
Entire offseasons are spent devising plans and building rosters in an effort to defeat the teams within your division.
That's with the idea that the two teams will play twice during the regular season. But meeting a third time? Well, that changes the dynamic.
The Steelers have played a divisional opponent in the postseason 12 times in their history, coming away with the victory in those games on 10 of those occasions. Saturday's playoff meeting with the Ravens in an AFC Wild Card game will mark the 13th divisional rematch in the postseason for the Steelers, and fifth against Baltimore.
The Steelers have won three of the previous four playoff meetings with the Ravens, but Saturday's game will be a little different than any other occasion in which they have played a divisional opponent for the third time.
Having faced the Ravens in Week 11, winning 18-16, and again in Week 16, losing 34-17, Saturday's game will mark the third meeting between the Steelers and Baltimore in a nine-week span. That is the quickest turnaround for the Steelers against a divisional opponent in team history for the third matchup.
That adds a little twist to things.
Certainly, both teams are very familiar with each other. But in this case, they have prepared to play against each other twice in a two-month period.
"I just think the more familiar you are, the more significant the strategic component is," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "But as a coach man, I welcome that. I want the responsibility of being a component of how this game unfolds and to try to stay a step ahead of them.
"I'm sure they have the same agenda regarding us. It doesn't get routine with each match up. It gets more sophisticated, it gets more complex, and from a coach's perspective, more fun."
That's a different perspective on meeting three times in so little time than Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh admitted to feeling about the game.
"I don't think there's any specific difficulty in it - this process is still the same," Harbaugh said. "You probably have certain things that are understood. There's a lot of things that have kind of been ingrained in your knowledge of a team in the division who you've already played twice, so your jumping-off point is further down the road for sure. That's about the only difference."
The Steelers have just been much more successful doing it.
While the Steelers are 10-2 the third time around against opponents, the Ravens are just 2-4 in such meetings, including 1-3 under Harbaugh, with the only win coming against the Steelers in 2014, a game in which Pittsburgh had lost star running back Le'Veon Bell the previous week in a win over the Bengals in the regular season finale.
This time around, it's the Ravens, who lost star wideout Zay Flowers to injury last week, who will be without a key offensive piece.
The Steelers have had success regardless of the head coach in such meetings. Tomlin is 3-2 in such games. Bill Cowher was 4-0. Chuck Noll was 3-0, with all three wins coming over the Oilers.
The Steelers are 2-0 against the Bengals in playoff games, 3-0 against the Oilers when they were a divisional opponent, 2-1 against the Browns and 3-1 against the Ravens.
This game will also mark the fourth time Tomlin and Harbaugh have faced off in a playoff game, the second-most in NFL history behind Chuck Noll and John Madden, who had five such meetings. Noll won three of the five.
This game will, however, mark the shortest amount of time the Steelers have had between the three meetings, beating the 1978 playoff game the Steelers played against the Houston Oilers.
In 1989, the Steelers and Oilers met in Weeks 7 and 13 before playing again on Wild Card Weekend, giving them 10 weeks between those three meetings.
The 1989 Steelers lost the two regular season meetings to Houston, 27-0 and 23-16, but shocked the Oilers, 23-20 in overtime at the Astrodome.
• The Steelers are the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a losing streak of at least four games, meaning it's certainly a rarity.
Thing is, to have at least a four-game losing streak and still make the postseason means you did a lot of good things early in the season.
Recapturing that magic will go a long way toward whether or not you hang around longer or not.
In the case of the two previous teams to go to the postseason in such circumstances, the 1999 Lions did not. But the 1986 New York Jets, who actually lost their final five games, did advance in the postseason.
The Lions, who started the season 8-4, backed into the playoffs at 8-8 and lost a Wild Card game to Washington.
The Jets, meanwhile, are a more interesting case.
They opened the season 10-1, losing only to New England in Week 2 and rattling off nine consecutive victories after that.
Then, the Jets were smashed, 45-3, in Week 12 against the Dolphins, with several starters getting injured in the game.
"We had a good team and we were flying high," Jets quarterback Pat Ryan told the New York Daily News. "They were touting us as the best team in the AFC.
"Then we got blown out by Miami, got a few guys hurt and it just started spiraling and it went down fast. We were in a bad place."
A 17-3 loss to the Rams followed, with a 24-10 defeat at the hands of the 49ers coming after that.
The Steelers handed the Jets their fourth-consecutive loss in Week 16, 45-24, with the Bengals finishing off the five-game losing streak with a 52-21 smackdown.
The Jets turned the ball over a ridiculous 18 times during the losing streak and forced just six. During their 10-1 start, they had forced 32 turnovers and had lost 19, making them plus-13.

Sound familiar?
But in the opening round of the playoffs, the Jets, who were the top Wild Card team, rebounded to beat the Chiefs, 35-15, forcing three turnovers and not turning the ball over themselves.
They were beaten, 23-20, the following week by the Browns in double overtime despite forcing two turnovers and not having any of their own.
The bottom line is the turnovers.
The Steelers were plus-15 in turnover margin in their 10 victories this season. They were plus-1 in turnover margin in their seven losses. But that doesn't tell the true story. The Steelers turned the ball over 11 times in their losses this season. They had seven turnovers in their 10 wins.
Taking care of the football and getting it out is a must.
• Pat Freiermuth's eight receptions in the Steelers' regular season finale vaulted him past George Pickens into the team lead for catches this season with a career high 65 for 653 yards.
It marks the first time a tight end has led the Steelers in receptions since Heath Miller did so in the 2012 season with 71.
"I haven't really thought about it, that's more of an offseason thought," said Freiermuth. "Hopefully, we have four more weeks to deal with before that happens. But, it's cool."
Freiermuth also led the Steelers with seven touchdown catches, matching his career high set in his rookie season.
With 220 receptions for 2,190 yards and 18 touchdowns in his first four seasons. His receptions and yardage are the most for a tight end in his first four seasons in team history, surpassing Miller's 168 receptions and the 2,063 yards posted by Eric Green.
Tight end production is something that is seemingly extremely beneficial. Of the 14 teams in the postseason this year, nine had a tight end catch at least 50 passes, led by Kansas City's Travis Kelce, who had 97 receptions.
And that doesn't take into account Buffalo's Dalton Kincaid, who had 44 receptions in 13 games, or Philadelphia's Dallas Goeddert, who had 42 catches in 10 games. Both almost certainly would have topped 50 receptions if healthy. The same goes for Minnesota's T.J. Hockenson, who was returning from an ACL injury, suffered late last season. Hockenson took a couple of games to ramp up his production, but finished with 41 receptions in 10 games.
In fact, The only outliers in terms of tight end among playoff teams are Denver, which had Adam Trautman lead its tight ends with 22 receptions, and the Rams, who got 30 catches for Colby Parkinson.
Steelers tight ends produced 96 catches for 933 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2024.
"Personally speaking, if you've got a tight end that can do a lot in the pass game, get open versus man against linebackers and safeties, those guys aren't supposed to guard you," Freiermuth said. "If you're winning those matchups and finding zones for it to be friendly to the quarterback, it takes a lot of stress off the quarterback."
• When the Steelers faced the Ravens in Week 11, cornerback Joey Porter Jr. shadowed Baltimore wide receiver Rashod Bateman throughout the game.
Bateman, Baltimore's deep threat in the passing game, had two catches for 30 yards on five targets in the 18-16 Steelers victory.
That's nothing new for Porter. In nine games this season, the Steelers utilized Porter in shadow coverage on an opposing wide receiver for at least two-thirds of their snaps.
In those situations, Porter allowed 14 receptions on 24 targets for 221 yards, breaking up three passes.
With both cornerback Donte Jackson and safety DeShon Elliott out in the rematch, the Steelers did not have Porter shadow anyone in coverage in the second meeting and he left the game early with an injury in a 34-17 loss.
With Flowers likely out for Saturday's game, it's not unreasonable to think the Steelers might have Porter shadow Bateman again in this game. Then again, they could simply choose to play sides and concentrate on slowing Balitmore's tight ends and running game.
• Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Pittonline@iheartmedia.com
Bateman averaged 16.8 yards per catch this season and had nine touchdown receptions, second only to tight end Mark Andrews in Baltimore's passing game. Flowers was the only Baltimore player to top 1,000 receiving yards this season, with 756.
The wide receivers on Baltimore's roster not named Flowers and Bateman – Nelson Agholor, Tylan Wallace, Devontez Walker and Steven Sims – also caught just 26 passes for the Ravens this season.
If the Steelers utilize Porter on Bateman also could allow the Steelers to utilize safeties Minkah Fitzpatrick and Elliott on Baltimore's tight ends, Andrews and Isaiah Likely, more often.
"I think (Elliott) is (important), because he's a big body. He matches up well, he plays physical, and as you know, those guys are good," said Steelers defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. "They're going to win some matchups, and he's going to win some matchups, and the goal is to make sure that at the end of the day that we're having a good day, and we come out on top. That means he's probably won his fair share of matchups. And that's really what we're looking for. We want to make sure we have the right matchups in place and give guys an opportunity to compete and make plays."
However the Steelers decide to deploy their defensive backs, they should have more answers for the problems the Ravens provide – especially with Flowers sidelined.
• The Steelers were one of 15 teams in the league to win at least 10 games this season.
That is the most in NFL history, topping the record of 13 that had been accomplished five times previously. That means that 46.9 percent of the NFL's teams finished with at least 10 wins, edging out the 42.9 percent (12 of 28) that had been set in both 1986 and 1991.
This season also marks the first time since the 2012 season that every team that earned a spot in the postseason did so with at least 10 wins and the first time that has happened since the league went to 14 teams in the playoffs in 2021.
That also means a 10-win team, in this case the Seahawks, did not make the postseason.

Labriola On
Labriola on the loss to the Chiefs
Steelers.com
Their problems, whatever they are, have not been fixed. They have talked about fixing them, they have vowed to do the necessary work to fix them. But when it comes time to play a game, it's clear their problems have not been fixed.
Three games ago, the Steelers were 10-3 and sitting atop the AFC North with a 2-game lead over Baltimore, with a mathematical chance to compete for the top seed in their conference. Everything they had talked about achieving and had worked for months to get into position to achieve, all of it was right in front of them and completely in their control. But now they're on a three-game losing streak after a 29-10 defeat on a Christmas Day that was anything but merry.
Even though this loss came at the hands of the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs, they should take no solace in that because the problems that cost them in Philadelphia proved to be versions of the issues that cost them in Baltimore six days later, and then things somehow were even worse four days after that.
"You know, that sucked, to be blunt," said Coach Mike Tomlin to open his postgame remarks to the media. "Not the type of ball we want to play, and really kind of eerily similar to our last performance in that we're not doing the fundamental things well enough. We're turning the ball over. We're not getting turnovers. That hasn't been a recipe for us, but it has been of late."
Those 10-3 Steelers had climbed to the upper rungs of the NFL in takeaways (28) and turnover ratio (plus-17) thanks to a top-5 defense that tortured opponents with relentless pressure, and they also exhibited a resiliency that helped them win twice as often as they lost when involved in 1-score games. But these 10-6 Steelers are none of those things, certainly none of those things consistently enough to win games against the caliber of competition they've faced over the last 11 days.
During the losing streak, their sack total went from 3 to 1 to none, their takeaways from 2 to 1 to none, and their turnover ratio from plus-1 to minus-1 to minus-2. Consequently they lost to the Eagles by 14 points, then to the Ravens by 17, and then to the Chiefs by 19.
Exacerbating the declining takeaway totals is the number of squandered opportunities for takeaways. Four times the ball was on the ground in the games against Baltimore and then Kansas City, and the Steelers came up with none of them. Balls batted into the air fell incomplete instead of secured by a defender for an interception. And some of these misses have turned out to be real tone-setters, coming at the times in which they did.
Against the Ravens for example, Alex Highsmith strip-sacked Lamar Jackson only to have the ball recovered by the guy who gave up the sack. If the Steelers recovered that, and if their offense takes advantage of the field position to score the game's first points so early and in such a way, maybe Lamar Jackson remains the discombobulated player who came into the game with a 1-4 record vs. the Steelers instead of blossoming into the MVP frontrunner he is now.
And if the Steelers had used that as fuel to win for the 9th time in their last 10 games vs. the Ravens, they would have clinched the AFC North Division with two games to go to then have the luxury of fine tuning some things and building momentum heading into the postseason.
But as the idiom goes, "If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, everyone would have a Merry Christmas," and the Steelers had anything but a Merry Christmas during a 3-hour tussle vs. the Chiefs that became disappointingly one-sided. It took some time, but the Chiefs established their superiority partly by taking advantage of situations along the way.
Because Kansas City won the toss and chose to defer, the Steelers offense was on the field to start the game. On a third-and-2, Russell Wilson lost control of the ball in the process of trying to avoid the rush, and that 11-yard loss led to a 40-yard punt returned 25 yards to set up Patrick Mahomes on the Steelers' side of midfield. Three running plays later, the Steelers defense had Kansas City in a fourth-and-1 situation from the Pittsburgh 33-yard line. A 4-yard run by Kareem Hunt moved the chains, and 4 plays later Mahomes completed a short pass to WR Xavier Worthy that became a 7-yard touchdown and a 6-0 lead.
The stretches of complementary football that had characterized the 10-3 Steelers vanished during the slide to 10-6, and the examples early in this game helped Kansas City take control. Corliss Waitman's second punt traveled 58 yards, and a big hit by ILB Mark Robinson on the return had the ball on the grass at the Chiefs 21-yard line. But it was Deon Bush who covered it to save possession for Kansas City. Starting with a third-and-11 from his own 20-yard line, Mahomes completed 3-of-4 for 74 yards, including an 11-yard touchdown to WR Justin Watson for a 13-0 lead.
Again with a chance to display some of that necessary complementary football, the Steelers ultimately came up empty. Starting at their 23-yard line following the kickoff, George Pickens made a nice play on a Russell Wilson deep shot for 41 yards, and then Jaylen Warren ripped off a 22-yard run over left tackle. Two more Warren carries and the ball was in the end zone, but a holding penalty on Darnell Washington took the touchdown off the board. On the next play, Wilson threw into coverage over the middle, and S Justin Reid intercepted in the end zone.
That the Steelers managed a touchdown before halftime and then a field goal in the third quarter was just a tease because Kansas City matched the third quarter field goal and followed it with back-to-back touchdowns, one of which came via a short field after a Pat Freiermuth fumble at the 34-yard line.
"So you can look at it from a lot of angles. The bottom line is junior varsity is not good enough," said Tomlin. "We've got to own that. But we've also got to look at what it is we need to do different. We're not going to continue to do the same things and hope for a different result. That doesn't seem sharp to me. So we're going to take a hard look at this. We've got a couple extra days before we get back into it. We're going to take a look at it and make whatever necessary changes we need to make in the totality of this thing, because again, that doesn't feel good. It doesn't look good. That's just the truth and reality of it."

Jefferson signed to one-year contract
The Steelers signed receiver Van Jefferson to a one-year contract.
In four seasons in the NFL, Jefferson has appeared in 61 games, starting 35. He has 113 receptions for 1,600 yards, a 14.2-yard average, and 10 touchdowns. He has also carried the ball four times for 23 yards, a 5.8-yard average.
Jefferson was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft, the 57th overall selection. He spent his first three seasons, and part of his fourth, with the Rams before he was traded to the Atlanta Falcons early in the 2023 season.
Jefferson played in five games for the Rams in 2023, starting four, and had eight receptions for 108 yards, a 13.5-yard average. With the Falcons he played in 12 games, starting five, and finished with 12 receptions for 101 yards, an 8.4-yard average.

He had his best season in 2021, starting all 17 games and finishing with 50 receptions for 802 yards, a 16-yard average, and six touchdowns, all career highs. His 16-yard average ranked sixth in the NFL, while he was third on the Rams in receptions and yards. Jefferson had four catches, one for a first down, in the Rams win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI.
As a rookie he played in all 16 games, finishing with 19 receptions for 220 yards, an 11.6-yard average, and one touchdown.
He played college football at Florida where he appeared in 23 games (2018-19), and Ole Miss, where he saw action in 22 games (2015-17). He finished his career with a combined 175 receptions for 2,159 yards, a 12.3-yard average, and 16 touchdowns.

Steelers make roster moves ahead of Ravens game
Steelers.com
The Steelers made multiple roster moves today, including activating offensive tackle Calvin Anderson to the 53-man roster from the Reserve/Injured, Designated for Return List.
In addition, the team signed receiver Scotty Miller to the practice squad and elevated him to the Active/Inactive Roster for the game. Miller will revert back to the practice squad after the game.
The team also elevated receiver Jamal Agnew from the practice squad to the Active/Inactive Roster for the game. Agnew will revert back to the practice squad after the game.
The team also released safety Ayo Oyelola from the practice squad.
Anderson, who was signed by the Steelers in September, was placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Dec. 14. He returned to practice earlier this week.
Anderson, who was originally signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent following the 2019 NFL Draft, has appeared in 46 career games, starting 14. He spent time with the Patriots and New York Jets, before being signed to the Denver Broncos 53-man roster in 2019.
Anderson played in all 16 games in 2020 for the Broncos, starting one at right tackle and one at left tackle. He appeared in 11 games in 2021, starting three, all at left tackle. In 2022, he played in 14 games, starting seven at left tackle for Denver, and allowed just two sacks, with no holding calls.
Anderson signed with the New England Patriots as an unrestricted free agent ahead of the 2023 season. He appeared in five games, starting two, in 2023 before being placed on the Reserve/Injured List where he finished out the season.
Miller, who was released from the 53-man roster on Thursday, signed a one-year contract with the team during the 2024 offseason.
He has appeared in 13 games this season, starting one. He has five receptions for 69 yards.
In six NFL seasons he has played in 80 games, pulling in 90 receptions for 1,154 yards and six touchdowns.
Agnew, who was signed to the practice squad on Nov. 12, is in his eighth season in the NFL, appearing in 77 career games. He has 77 career receptions for 746 yards, a 9.7-yard average, and five touchdowns.
Agnew was originally drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft. He spent four seasons with the Lions, where he had 16 receptions for 105 yards.
He signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021, spending three seasons there and pulling in 61 receptions for 641 yards and five touchdowns.

Rookie Recap: Troy Fautanu
Steelers.com
Troy Fautanu went into the 2024 season with so much hope for his rookie year.
The team's No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft was looking to step in and start at tackle and be a steady force all season on the team's offensive line.
Unfortunately, it didn't play out that way.
Fautanu, the 20th overall pick in the draft out of the University of Washington, suffered a knee injury in the preseason opener, which forced him to miss the remainder of the preseason.
He was able to come back, starting the team's Week 2 game against the Denver Broncos, but landed back on the injury report the following week with a separate injury and was placed on the Reserve/Injured List, where he spent the rest of the season.
"I remember the play exactly," said Fautanu. "I was trying to sit down and anchor and it kind of just gave out. It felt a little different than it did previously. I kind of knew something was up.
"It was heartbreaking when I got that MRI. There was nothing I could do about it.
"All I know is that I was crying. I don't cry too much. That was pretty heartbreaking because you have so many expectations coming into the year, especially for myself. I expect a lot from myself. I knew how much work I had put in. It cut my season short, very short."
While there were tears, there was also plenty of resolve from Fautanu to make sure he moved in the right direction.
"It's not how I wanted this to go, how I planned on it going," said Fautanu. "I did learn a lot just being around here. I had an opportunity to go do my rehab elsewhere. But I wanted to be here and be around the team. I'm learning and picking up a lot of things from these guys that have been around the league a long time. I'm just excited to really attack this offseason and get back on the field.
"For me, it's all been time off. I've had three months off. I'm ready to go."
Fautanu, who said if the Steelers continued a playoff run he might have been able to come back, fully expects to be back when the Steelers return for OTAs.
"One hundred percent," said Fautanu. "I'll be ready to go then. I'm looking to just get ready. Mentally, I've been ready to play football.
"I feel like I haven't played football in years, just watching. I'm excited to attack the offseason. I've had my time off. I'm ready to go."
Learning was one of the biggest benefits for Fautanu this year, getting a grasp on what it takes to play at the NFL level, what is required, and so much more.
"Just kind of seeing everyone's routine, what they do in terms of taking care of your body," said Fautanu. "In college, I could go out there and play without taking care of my body, go home and eat whatever I want and show up on Saturday and play pretty well.
"In this league, you've got to find a way to get a winning edge and that's by taking care of your body. That's something I learned the last few months."

Hunter wants to break the mold as two-way player
Contributing Writer/Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - There have been players in the past who dabbled with playing both offense and defense in the NFL over the years but there hasn't been a full-time two-way player since Chuck Bednarik in the '50s.
Colorado's Travis Hunter wants to change that. And he's adamant about doing so.
The reigning Heisman Trophy winner was a standout at both wide receiver and cornerback for the Buffalos the past two seasons and he would like the opportunity to do the same thing at the NFL level.
"Nobody has done it but I feel like I have put my body through a lot," Hunter said Thursday here at the NFL Scouting Combine. "I do a lot of treatment. People don't get to see that part. What I do for my body to make sure I'm 100 percent each game. I feel like nobody has done it. I know I can do it. I did it at the college level where you really get breaks. There are a lot more breaks in the NFL."
With cornerback Donte Jackson headed to free agency March 12 when the new league year begins, the Steelers could be interested in acquiring a top-notch cornerback to play opposite Joey Porter Jr.
But, general manager Omar Khan said earlier this week the Steelers also still haven't closed the door on Jackson returning.
"We've had a conversation with Donte. It was a good experience with Donte," Khan said. "He got the ball back for us a lot. If I'm not mistaken, I think it was seven times between interceptions and fumble recoveries. But, he's a free agent, so all options are on the table."
Hunter, however, will probably be long gone by the time the Steelers make their first pick in the draft with the 21st selection.
Hunter had 96 receptions for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns as a wide receiver at Colorado in 2024. He also had 36 tackles with four interceptions and 11 pass breakups as a cornerback.
Some teams might view him as a better defensive back, while others might lean toward him being a better wide receiver.
Hunter, however, just wants to be viewed as a football player who can do both.
"I did some meetings at receiver, did some meetings at DB, so it's still up in the air," Hunter said of the multiple meetings he has had with teams here at the Combine.
Thing is, he might be the best player in this draft at both positions, something that could make him a top-5 pick in April.
It also might make him the first-overall pick.
"I've got my own unique case that I play both sides of the ball," Hunter said of his case for being the top pick. "Not that many people in the NFL have done it."
But Hunter is hardly the only cornerback or wide receiver who will be selected in the first round of this draft.
In fact, Michigan's Will Johnson isn't ready to cede being the top cornerback available in this draft.

"A lot of respect to him," Johnson said of Hunter. "He won the Heisman, did a lot of great things, but I know I'm the best corner in this draft. I'm going to just wait until I get on the field and let my play do the talking."
They could have gotten the opportunity to start to settle that argument Friday, as defensive backs take the field for their on-field workouts here at Lucas Oil Stadium. But neither Hunter nor Johnson will work out with the other defensive backs, choosing instead to wait until their respective pro days to do so.
In Johnson's case, it's because he's still recovering from a turf toe injury that cut his season short.
"I physically couldn't cut, couldn't play, couldn't be out there," Johnson said. "I did everything I could every day to try to get back. I was there with my teammates in meetings and at practice trying to still be very involved, but just never physically could play."

Labriola on the loss to the Ravens
Steelers.com
There was a recipe.
The "A" players had to perform to an "A" level. The game couldn't be won in the first quarter, but it could be lost in the first quarter, meaning it was going to require 60 minutes to leave with a victory, but allowing the opponent to build a big, early lead could make it impossible to close a sizable gap against a quality team on its home field.
Check off those boxes, and then you'll have a chance to win it in the fourth quarter because historically that's what it always comes down to in these games vs. the Ravens.
It may have been simple, but that didn't make it easy.
The Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs by a 28-14 loss to the Ravens in the Wild Card Round at M&T Bank Stadium, and it's because they didn't follow the recipe.
This was how it started. On the offense's first four possessions – roughly an entire half of football – it ran 17 plays, got 2 first downs, and punted 4 times. In that same half of football, the defense allowed the Ravens to rush for 164 yards and convert 7-of-8 on third down. Particularly troublesome was Baltimore's 13-play, 85-yard touchdown drive that contained nothing but running plays and required only 2 third-down conversions.
At the end of the first half, Derrick Henry had 100 yards rushing on a 7.7 average, including a 34-yard chunk run; and Lamar Jackson had 64 yards rushing on a 5.8 average, including a 20-yard chunk run.
"We just weren't physical enough," said OLB Alex Highsmith. "We didn't work off enough blocks. We didn't make enough tackles, and you know that's what it's all about. To stop the run, you have to be physical. You have to make tackles and didn't do that enough tonight."
That's especially disappointing when it happens vs. the Ravens. This is a hatred that had its roots in the 1950s when the Ravens used to be headquartered in Cleveland, and the teams' fans would pack Cleveland Stadium on a Saturday night to watch a bar fight on the field while many of their members threw hands in the stands. Fast forward a generation or two, and Steelers vs. Ravens in the 2008 AFC Championship Game was so violent that it became the impetus for what's now known as the "player safety initiative."
So when one team establishes a physical superiority in one of these tussles, it's especially not fun at all for the other team. Because as Joe Greene once put it, "NFL football is not an 'excuse me' profession."
The Steelers' deficit was 21-0, and the Ravens were due to receive the kickoff to open the second half. From that point on, the Steelers may have been able to trade punches during the third and fourth quarters, but the Ravens are too good and were too effective running the ball to allow the eventual outcome ever to be in real doubt.
"There were times we weren't in our gaps," said DT Cam Heyward, "and there were times we didn't tackle well. Props to them. To (Derrick Henry) and (Lamar Jackson), they had a lot of success. I wish we had a better outcome. Guys fought, but to start the game 21-0 didn't really do ourselves any favors."
To start the second half, the Steelers defense forced a punt when ILB Elandon Roberts stopped Henry for no gain on a third-and-1 near midfield. Russell Wilson followed by leading the offense on a 9-play, 98-yard touchdown drive where he converted a third-and-9 from the 3-yard line with a 25-yard beauty down the middle of the field to Calvin Austin III, a third-and-5 with a 37-yard moonball down the sideline to Mike Williams, and then a third-and-10 with a 30-yard strike into the end zone to Van Jefferson for a touchdown.
It was exactly what the Steelers had needed a couple of quarters earlier.
The Ravens next offensive series began with a 10-yard sack of Jackson by Highsmith, but that was overcome with 3 successive big plays. A 21-yard pass from Jackson to WR Tylan Wallace, a 15-yard jet sweep by Steven Sims, and the coup de grace was a 44-yard dash through the defense by Henry for an answering touchdown.
Yes, the Steelers even found an answer to that when Wilson completed 3-for-3 for 66 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown to George Pickens, but even though that looked pretty it had the feel of "too little too late" even though there was still 18 minutes to play.
"I just think sometimes when people are playing with a lead, you get those opportunities," said Coach Mike Tomlin. "I appreciate the efforts of the guys. Certainly, we were playing to win, but we weren't able to close the distance. I thought that big run by (Derrick Henry) kind of quelled some of that. Obviously, I appreciate the efforts and the intensity in which we took the field in the second half."
But the deficit simply was a bridge too far.
"Congratulations to the Ravens. They were the better group today," said Tomlin. "The X-factor was Lamar's unique talents. It seems like every time we got him behind the sticks, he made up for it, or when we got him in a possession down circumstance he extended and won those circumstances. We never really found a fluid answer all day. That was highlighted by our inability to convert third downs in the first half, and they wore us out a little bit. The fatigue component of it became a factor. You can sum it all up to say they were certainly the better group today."
There is an excitement to qualifying for the playoffs, but when it ends it does so abruptly. The Steelers now will have months to stew over a season that contained the hope and promise of a 10-3 record in December only to have it unravel with four straight losses to end the regular season and then a final defeat at the hands of the Ravens.
And although these Ravens came into the game at 12-5 and as the back-to-back AFC North champs, they were the same Ravens the Steelers had defeated in 8 of the last 10 meetings and 4 of the last 5 in Baltimore. It was interpreted as a good sign that their measuring stick would be against an opponent with which they were familiar, an opponent against which they had success both at home and on the road.
That the outcome then would be a 2-touchdown defeat is going to leave a scar.
"I'm worried less about the regular season," said Tomlin. "We're in the single-elimination tournament. I'm really just disappointed in how we performed tonight, given the opportunity we had."

PATRICK QUEEN Inside Linebacker
An every-down, all-situations inside linebacker is asked to be active against both the run and the pass and to make plays whenever possible. Patrick Queen had 5 tackles including 1 for loss, plus 1 of the Steelers' 4 sacks, 2 hits on the quarterback, a forced fumble, and he tipped a pass that ended up being intercepted by Beanie Bishop.

Rookie Recap: Joey Porter Jr.
Steelers.com
Cornerback Joey Porter Jr., the Steelers second-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, is someone who will never back down from a challenge in football and that was evident during his rookie season.
Porter emerged as someone who was assigned to cover the opponent's top receivers and he didn't disappoint.
"I'm really excited about the trajectory of his career," said Coach Mike Tomlin. "Probably the most impressive component of where he is, is his mindset. He wants the fight. He wants the tough coverage. He's extremely competitive in that way. And that's a great place to build from.
"He's got growth ahead of him, but that's real solid."
Porter finished the season with 42 tackles, 32 of them solo stops, 10 passes defensed, an interception against the Baltimore Ravens, and a tackle for a loss.
Porter, who is a finalist for the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year, was named to the Pro Football Writers of America All-Rookie team.
Porter didn't enter the season as a starter, but his playing time gradually grew through the first six games of the season, and by Week 8 he earned a starting role when the team played the Jacksonville Jaguars.
And he never looked back.
"I think about that often," said Porter, the son of former Steelers linebacker Joey Porter Sr. "If I played Week 1, I don't know how my body would feel. I am glad they slowed the process down for me."
Porter said there are areas he still wants to focus on in his game, while at the same time knowing he grew as the season progressed.
"I feel like there are a lot of areas that I need to work on, and I am still working on," said Porter. "Overall, I have grown as a player. I am happy where I am and there is still work to do."
Porter also won the Joe Greene Great Performance Award, given by the Pittsburgh Chapter of the Pro Football Writers of America to the team's rookie of the year.
At that time, he talked about being a second-round pick and said it still bothers him that he was passed over by so many teams.
"It still gets under my skin sometimes," said Porter. "I felt like I was CB1 for sure, and it didn't pan out that way. And luckily it didn't pan out that way because I ended up here. I feel like it was worth it.
"I feel like it elevated my game even more because I came into the league with a chip on my shoulder to prove myself. I feel like I'm still proving myself every day when I step on the field. I don't feel like I am there yet. I have a lot to learn."
Porter said the chip might not come off his shoulder until some big things happen in his career.
"I got to win a couple of rings for that to go away," said Porter.
While the chip is there, so is Porter's confidence as he is one to never back down from covering the opponent's top receiver.
"It just might be a Porter thing that we all have. I was like that as a kid," said Porter. "I always wanted the biggest task. I wanted to make the play.
"I wanted to be in those positions because I know some people get scared of the bright lights and I look forward to them. I just want to be in that moment every time."

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 20
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM, PA: Can you tell me how many offensive snaps WR Mike Williams played after being acquired at the trading deadline? I've been seeing fans complaining about him not getting a chance, but I thought he had ample opportunity to prove himself. I think he's a good receiver, but maybe he didn't know his routes well enough or maybe he wasn't getting separation. Can you let me know his snap count and maybe give me your thoughts. ANSWER: Mike Williams was acquired in a trade with the New York Jets, and after coming to the Steelers, he appeared in 9 games, with 2 starts, and played 171 offensive snaps. With that playing time, Williams was targeted 13 times, and he finished with 9 catches for 132 yards (13.4 average) and 1 TD to go along with accounting for 5 first downs. I don't know specifically why Williams' production wasn't higher, but based on the state of the Steelers' offense down the stretch (no more than 17 points in any of the defeats during the 5-game losing streak), I have trouble believing Williams wasn't being targeted on purpose.
TODD CRUM FROM RED BANK, TN: With the injuries to Troy Fautanu and James Daniels on the offensive line and then the development of Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick, there will be big decisions before the start of next season. On paper, this looks like a young, strong, and improving part of our team. What would you like to see happen with this group during the offseason? Trade one or two for other needs? Keep everyone for training camp and have a big competition? Or release bigger contracts for more cap space? ANSWER: Nate Herbig, Dan Moore Jr., and James Daniels all are set to become unrestricted free agents in March, and so they're not counting on the salary cap. Besides Isaac Seumalo (roughly $8 million on the cap assuming he makes the 53-man roster) everyone else is either on a rookie contract or a reserve/futures deal, which means money is not an issue as this unit is currently constituted. Because of the unrestricted free agent situation, the Steelers look to have 5 starting-caliber offensive linemen, and injuries rarely allow 5 to be enough over the course of a full season. The Steelers don't have a surplus of offensive linemen, and right now I believe it's easy to make the case they don't have enough offensive linemen.
CHRISTOPHER WINKLER FROM FRANKLIN, PA: A recent submission got me wondering about field setup for international games. Obviously most of the venues where the games are played are actually soccer fields repurposed for football. Who sets up the field and goalposts and makes sure it is all done correctly? ANSWER: Being that international games are now regular season games and count in the standings, the NFL takes over and is responsible for every aspect, from the quality of the playing surface, the setting up of the field, installing the goalposts, hooking up the in-helmet communication systems and the video replay equipment. Everything.
DAVID HALLBERG FROM SPARTANSBURG, PA: Do you think Daniel Jones would be better than Russell Wilson or Justin Fields? ANSWER: I do not.
DELMAS MAYNARD FROM DINGESS, WV: If the Steelers don't keep Russell Wilson, and if Matthew Stafford is available, then do you think they go after Stafford? ANSWER: Matthew Stafford is under contract to the Rams through the 2026 season, and so the first issue to consider is how is he available? Would it be via trade, or would it be in the event the Rams release him? If it would be via trade, what would the Rams require in return? And if Stafford would be released, what might other potentially interested teams be willing to offer him? One final thought: you ignored the possibility of the Steelers re-signing Justin Fields, which might be your most significant oversight in proposing your scenario.
MARK GATES FROM ERIE, PA: I realize the old saying is that hindsight is 20/20, but I can't help but think what a wasted first-round draft pick the Steelers spent on Kenny Pickett, and how it continues to hurt this team. I know there are several first-round quarterbacks who didn't pan out in the history of the NFL, but since Pickett was playing at Pitt, and with the inside knowledge and expertise of the Steelers staff, this pick reminds me of something the Cleveland Browns would do. I really thought of this when he was playing in the end of the Super Bowl as a mop-up. Your opinion please? ANSWER: Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season, and General Manager Kevin Colbert had announced he was going to retire after the 2022 NFL Draft. My memory of that 2022 offseason was that Colbert wanted to leave the Steelers with some options at quarterback, because after the organizational decision had been made to stick with Roethlisberger after his elbow surgery in 2019, the idea was then to try to give him as much as possible to work with in his final couple of seasons with the team. That's why WR Chase Claypool was the team's first pick (second round) in 2020, why RB Najee Harris and TE Pat Freiermuth were the first two picks in 2021. In Roethlisberger's final season, the other quarterbacks were Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins. I believe that's why the Steelers made the quick move to sign Mitch Trubisky when free agency opened in 2022 and then spent that No. 1 pick in the draft on Kenny Pickett. Looking at those quarterback moves in real time:
• Trubisky was a 27-year-old veteran NFL starter (29-21 record in 4 seasons) who had enough size, arm strength, and mobility within the pocket to have been the 2nd overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. He was signed to a 2-year, $14.3 million contract with only $5.2 million guaranteed. Very reasonable terms for the team. • The Steelers viewed Pickett as the best quarterback available in the 2022 NFL Draft. That didn't mean they saw him as the "next Roethlisberger," as a quarterback who could carry a team to the Super Bowl. He wasn't special from a raw skills perspective, but he had shown some moments in college where he produced for his team in critical situations in big games.
Looking back now, Brock Purdy was the best quarterback available in the 2022 NFL Draft, and even though he was a bargain as a 7th-round pick, he's not a "carry a team to the Super Bowl" quarterback either. The draft is not an exact science, and at the NFL level, scouting/evaluating quarterbacks has been proven statistically to be extremely difficult. Trubisky showed himself to be a guy more comfortable as a backup. Pickett found winning at the NFL level to be way more difficult/complex/nuanced than it was in college, and then when the Steelers were able to add Russell Wilson for the veteran minimum because the Broncos were picking up the rest of the tab, and then had Justin Fields fall into their laps for what ended up being a future sixth-round pick, Pickett decided he wanted to "start over" somewhere else instead of stay and learn from the Super Bowl winning veteran and compete with the ex-11th overall pick who had been unsuccessful (10-28-0) as a 3-year starter in Chicago.
It is fine to be disappointed with how those moves panned out, but I don't believe all of the outcomes of those moves were foreseeable. But you're right about one thing: hindsight is 20/20.
WILL McINTOSH FROM BELLEVIEW, FL: My questions has to do with the helmet radio and play-calling. Who can talk to the quarterback? Is it just the offensive coordinator or just the head coach or a combination of both? And what about a defensive coordinator, if they see a weakness in the opponent's alignment? ANSWER: One coach per team is allowed to communicate directly with the quarterback, and the play-caller is typically that person. If the coordinator is calling the plays, he's talking to the quarterback; if the head coach (Andy Reid, Sean McVay) is calling the plays, then he's the one with the direct line to the quarterback, and that communication is cut off with 15 seconds left on the play clock.
CARSTEN BRAUN FROM NEUWIED, GERMANY: Great to see the Steelers coming to Europe/Dublin. My question is about Cameron Johnston: I had high hopes to see very improved punting from the Steelers at the start of last season, but then he was injured and done for the season. Is it reasonable to assume that he can/will be the punter in 2025? ANSWER: Cameron Johnston sustained a significant knee injury in the regular season opener, and that required surgery and landed him on the injured reserve list for the rest of the season. The injury was to Johnston's right knee, and that's his punting leg. He is diligent in his rehabilitation, but I don't believe there's any way to know definitively at this stage what his status will be for the 2025 season.
STEFAN PISOCKI FROM WILMINGTON, DE: Since moving from the New York City area, I have not followed the trainwreck known as the Jets. But I hear they have a wide receiver, Garrett Wilson, who wants out. I took a look at his stats, 7 touchdowns, over 1,000 yards receiving, and only 24 years old. Can the Steelers make a George Pickens-for-Garrett Wilson trade happen? Would draft picks need to be thrown in? ANSWER: One of the things about fans is they're under the impression that opposing teams are willing to make lopsided trades with their favorite team. Garrett Wilson was the 11th overall pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, and he has 279 catches on 492 targets for 3,249 yards (11.6 average) and 54 touchdowns. George Pickens was a No. 2 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, and he has 174 catches on 293 targets for 2,841 yards (16.3 average) and12 touchdowns. The Jets have a new head coach and reportedly have told Aaron Rodgers he won't be brought back, and so I don't see any possibility that they would be willing to trade Wilson even-up for Pickens. In fact, in my opinion, it only makes sense to give Wilson a shot with a new coach and coordinator and quarterback and to give the new coach and coordinator and quarterback an opportunity with a guy who was an 11th overall pick of a recent draft.

Rookie Recap: Darnell Washington
Steelers.com
Darnell Washington's numbers aren't anything that make your eyes pop out of your head from his rookie season, with seven receptions for 61 yards for the tight end who was selected in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft.
But numbers don't always tell the story.
When he was in the lineup, Washington was used more in a blocking role, doing the 'dirty work' for the offense.
It's work he readily accepts, but he also welcomes the opportunity to see his role grow in 2024.
"Everyone wants to be involved. Everyone wants a piece of the pie," said Washington. "Some people's pieces are bigger. I don't complain about anything.
"I love doing the dirty work and whoever decides that part, if they want me to do more of the dirty work, I am all for it. I am 110 percent in. I value my role. I embrace it. If I keep getting to do it, it's a blessing."
Washington said doing that dirty work is something that drives him, and he doesn't do it for the recognition, he does it for the love of the game. "It's actually fun," said Washington. "Sometimes people notice it, sometimes they don't. If it's a big run, big play, sometimes they value it, sometimes they don't.
"It's just what I do. If I make a key block, I cherish that moment. I just keep to myself and don't worry about other's opinions or thoughts. I just stick to myself."
Washington was part of an overall rookie class that drew praise from Coach Mike Tomlin at the end of the season for the contributions they made.
"I thought we got quality production from them," said Tomlin of the rookie class. "In many instances, they didn't wilt, which was good. We were thoughtful about their participation in most instances early on in an effort so they could be available for us down the stretch. That played out relatively well, to be quite honest with you.
"I'm excited about the group. Guys in that group, I think they got bright futures ahead of them and excited about being a component of their development."

There are a lot of people who made a difference through the history of the NFL, but there haven't been a lot of people like the late Bill Nunn.
Nunn began his career with the Steelers as a part-time scout in 1967, and then moved into a full-time role from 1969-2014.
And while his title was scout, his role was so much broader.
Nunn was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2021, the first Black Contributor in the 100 plus year history of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
"He never changed," said his daughter Lynell Nunn at the time of his enshrinement. "He was always so concerned about diversity with the players, coaches and front office. That goes back to the time I was young. He was always looking for that, during his pre-Steelers time and after that.
"It was always important to him, and he instilled that in us. Seeing the progress that has been made, and knowing he had a fairly big part in that, means a lot. I am really proud of the legacy that he left."
That legacy is still felt today, even if some aren't fully aware of the role he played in the opportunities they are now afforded.
The legendary scout opened the door for players from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, something that didn't just impact the Steelers, it impacted the entire NFL.
During a time when Black college players weren't getting mainstream attention, Nunn was giving them the recognition they deserved, and it didn't go unnoticed.
Nunn, who passed away in 2014 at the age of 89, attended West Virginia State University, an HBCU, where he was a three-year captain on the basketball team and a member of the school's undefeated team in 1948.
Prior to his time with the Steelers, he embarked on an impactful career in the newspaper business, including as a sportswriter, editor, and then managing editor of The Pittsburgh Courier.
Starting in 1950 he selected the newspaper's annual Black College All-American Team, developing relationships that benefited him in his scouting career and opened the door for Black players who weren't getting attention from teams.
If you are a Steelers fan, the names John Stallworth, Donnie Shell, Mel Blount and L.C. Greenwood are among the ones Bill Nunn brought to the table.
"Bill in my mind was a game-changer for guys in my era that went to Black colleges," said Stallworth. "Bill was a force in the room for us. Most guys in the past, before us, didn't have anyone to talk about their pedigree, how good they were, what their capabilities were, their talent, what kind of man they were. Bill was a voice in the room for guys in Black colleges in the early years. He paved the way."
But there were others, just ask the New York Giants, who drafted future Hall of Famer Roosevelt 'Rosey' Brown in the 27th round of the 1953 NFL Draft, after late owner Wellington Mara learned about Brown through Nunn's All-America team in the Courier. Even Brown's bio on the Pro Football Hall of Fame page references him making Nunn's team.
"In the 1953 National Football League Draft, the New York Giants selected a 1952 Black All-America tackle from little-known Morgan State College in the 27th round. His name was Roosevelt Brown, and his youth and relative inexperience were obvious when he joined the Giants for his first summer training camp."
And Los Angeles Rams fans should forever be grateful to Nunn, as he touted Deacon Jones, a future Hall of Famer they selected in the 14th round of the 1961 NFL Draft.
Nunn was one of the few people to earn six Super Bowl rings with the Steelers, after coming out of retirement to return to the team on a part-time basis.
"You can't write the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers without Bill Nunn," said Blount. "When you look at the Steelers of the 1970s, none of that would have happened without Bill Nunn."
The last Black College All-America Team Nunn selected for the Pittsburgh Courier was in 1974, and a member of that team was Stallworth. Nunn scouted Stallworth, along with other BLESTO scouts who at that time would travel together, on a wet track at Alabama A&M, and the wide receiver didn't time well in the 40-yard dash.
The group was leaving Alabama the next morning, but Nunn said he felt 'ill' and was staying and would catch up with them on the road. What he did, though, was go back and time Stallworth on a dry track and he got the results he wanted. Also, through his relationship with HBCU coaches, he was able to obtain the only game film of Stallworth that existed. He promised to return the film to be shared but never did.
The rest, as they say, is history.
That 1974 Steelers team went on to win Super Bowl IX, with 11 players from HBCUs, and the Steelers 1974 NFL Draft Class that included four Hall of Fame players in the first five picks – Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, Stallworth, and Mike Webster – plus another – Shell – as an undrafted rookie is acknowledged as the greatest draft class of all-time.
Nunn was a member of the Inaugural Class of the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2010 and a 2018 Steelers Hall of Honor selection.
He helped the Steelers find talent from HBCUs that other teams largely ignored, and Shell, who played at South Carolina State, is someone who knows he wouldn't have landed with the Steelers, and eventually the Pro Football Hall of Fame as well, without Nunn.
"Bill Nunn has done so much for the league over the years, not only for the Steelers but also when he was a reporter by going to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and finding all of the talent there and letting the NFL teams know about that talent," said Shell. "And what he did for the Steelers. Look at how many players he brought to the Steelers to help build those championship teams.
"We had side conversations that no one ever knew about. He was a confidant. If I had some issues, if I didn't do well in practice, I would talk to Bill, and it wouldn't go any further than that. He would sit me down and say keep working hard and doing what you are doing, you will be fine. When you are young, that gave you encouragement to keep working hard. Nobody ever knew about that.
"I don't know if he realized it or not, but just being around Bill, his professionalism, the way he carried himself in his life, it meant a lot to me and had a great effect on me. He never would have thought that. That is the way he was, unassuming. That was Bill. That is who he was. He made people gravitate to him. You wanted to be with him. You wanted to be in his presence to listen to some of the wisdom that he had."

Rookie Recap: Mason McCormick
Steelers.com
There are plenty of times when a rookie season doesn't live up to expectations.
For guard Mason McCormick, his rookie season exceeded the expectations of many, but were just what he expected from himself.
McCormick was selected by the Steelers in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft, the 119th overall pick.
He appeared in all 17 games, starting 14, one at left guard and then he stepped in in Week 5 and took over at right guard after James Daniels suffered a season ending injury.
"I feel like I learned and grew a lot," said McCormick. "Obviously, it didn't finish the way we wanted it to, but I look forward to keep progressing and keep being better because of it.
"I learned so many different things. Just as a person, as a player, in many different ways. I learned a lot about myself. I learned a lot about this team. And I think that that makes for a good future. It allows us to move forward in a good direction."
While McCormick wasn't pegged as someone who would immediately step into a starting job by many, in his mind, starting right off the bat was definitely the goal.
"I feel like you have to have that confidence coming in," said McCormick. "If you don't believe in yourself, nobody will. And so, yes, I did expect to come in and play and obviously I feel bad for James. But I feel like I took advantage of it.
"I started pretty much the whole season. And so, as a rookie, you have to keep learning and growing, because there's a lot to learn. And I don't feel like it was that bad."
"You always want to be better. Football is kind of imperfect, and there are always going to be plays that you wish you could get back. And that's kind of the mindset I had."
McCormick, who played college football at South Dakota State, said getting accustomed to the NFL vs. college was something that came rather easily to him, and something he felt comfortable with once he got everything down pat.
"Obviously the speed picked up for me, but I felt like I adapted to it pretty quick," said McCormick. "And then just the schematic stuff as well. It was really cool to be able to learn and grow that.
"My football intellect definitely grew a lot. And watching film, the detail is much higher. It's your job. I love doing it. I love watching film. It's been really cool to be able to learn in that area.
"And just being out here in Pittsburgh by myself, on my own. I was in South Dakota where I'm from for college, so I always had people around. And to be able to get away and kind of do this on my own has been awesome. I feel like the responsibilities are on you, which kind of was the case in college, but more here and I've loved being out here."
While handling things on his own was an aspect McCormick enjoyed, he also depended on others along the way, especially his teammates.
One in particular was veteran guard Isaac Seumalo.
Seumalo is a quieter person by nature, but had no problem speaking up and sharing valuable insight and advice with McCormick.
"Isaac Seumalo has done a ton for me," said McCormick. "Obviously being a nine-year veteran, being a guard, he was there for me. He's helped me a ton.
"I feel like once you're around him quite a bit, he opens up. He does talk a lot around me. He's taught me a ton. He has helped me with everything from on-field techniques to pre-snap thought process, to how to watch film, and how to study different things. He has shared what he looks for and things to just make yourself more efficient."
Now, with the offseason in full swing, McCormick is taking everything he learned as a rookie and making sure he is going to be ready to apply it to Year 2.
"There's a lot of different things technique-wise I want to work on," said McCormick. "That and just keep growing mentally as a football player."

Rookie Recap: Keeanu Benton
Steelers.com
When the Steelers drafted defensive lineman Keeanu Benton in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft, the 49th overall pick, there was instant excitement about what he could bring to the defense.
"He's a big, strong guy. Really active. Good hands," said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on draft day. "For a big guy, you'll see him venture outside the box chasing things down. He's got a good motor. You can see he's in really good shape. He plays a lot of snaps. Sometimes you'll watch guys and they're splitting snaps with other guys. He's an 80 to 85 percent guy. So, he keeps himself in really good shape, really good competitive sphere, big strong guy. I like him."
Fast forward to the end of the 2023 season, and Benton didn't disappoint.
As the season wore on, his playing time increased, starting nine of 17 games, including eight of the last nine games at nose tackle.
"You see him understanding the game a little more," said Austin. "He's big. He's strong. I think really the big thing for him is he's gotten better because, as the season has gone on, he started to understand blocking schemes a little better. When guys that are really talented kind of understand what's coming at you, then they have an opportunity to defeat it, and he's starting to get to that."
Benton finished the regular season with 36 tackles, 20 of them solo stops, and recorded his first NFL sack in Week 3 against the Las Vegas Raiders.
"I'm really excited about the prospects of his future," said Coach Mike Tomlin during his season ending press conference. "He's really talented. I think he's capable of being dominant sooner rather than later. And so, the question is how quickly can we make that happen and what are our roles in doing so. We had a real good conversation about what that looks like foundationally and how do we build."
Benton saw his game grow as the season progressed, a lot of which he credited to learning from the veterans around him.
"That comes with going under the veteran's wings," said Benton. "Getting to know your body. Learning techniques to keep up with your body early. It's good that a lot of our older guys are open books, and we can ask those questions. They let us be their shadow, guys like Larry (Ogunjobi), Cam (Heyward), T.J. (Watt), all those guys. Taking care of my body was a big part of it."

Holcomb, Lee and Wilson return to practice
Steelers.com
Linebacker Cole Holcomb, defensive lineman Logan Lee and receiver Roman Wilson returned to practice today but remain on the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform List (Holcomb) and Reserve/Injured List (Lee and Wilson).
The Steelers have a 21-day window to either activate any of them to the 53-man roster, or they remain out for the the remainder of the year.
Holcomb suffered a season-ending knee injury last season against the Tennessee Titans. Holcomb had 54 tackles and two forced fumbles before he was injured.
The Steelers signed Holcomb as an unrestricted free agent before the 2023 season, after he spent four years with the Washington Commanders.
Lee was placed on the Reserve/Injured List before the start of the regular season.
Lee, one of the team's sixth-round draft picks, played college football at Iowa. He appeared in 43 games, starting 41 of them, and had 158 career tackles, including 58 solo stops, 18.5 tackles for a loss, nine sacks and seven passes defensed.

Steelers name McCurley inside linebackers coach
Steelers.com
The Steelers named Scott McCurley the team's inside linebackers coach.
McCurley, who is a Western Pennsylvania native, spent the last five seasons (2020-24) as the linebackers coach for the Dallas Cowboys and a total of 18 years in the NFL, 15 in a coaching role.
Last season, McCurley oversaw the Cowboys linebackers who recorded 22 of the team's 52 sacks, while Micah Parsons recorded a team-high 12 sacks for the season, becoming the first player since Reggie White in 1982 to record at least 12 sacks in their first four seasons. Parsons went on to be named to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl Games in 2024. Cowboys linebacker Eric Kendricks led the team with a career-high 145 tackles, including three tackles for a loss, three sacks and a team-high three forced fumbles, despite missing two games injured.
Injuries caused some shuffling at the linebacker position for the Cowboys in 2023, but the unit responded. Second-year linebacker Damone Clark moved to middle linebacker and led the team with a career-high 115 tackles, including four tackles for a loss. Markquese Bell moved from safety to linebacker and finished second on the team with 103 tackles.
The Cowboys defense was ranked third in rushing touchdowns allowed in 2022 with nine, and ninth in opponent negative rushing play percentage (9.8%). Leighton Vander Esch started 14 games, finishing second on the defense with 100 tackles, while Anthony Barr had 61 tackles. Rookie Damone Clark also stepped up under McCurley's guidance, and after missing the first seven games of the season injured, he recorded 50 tackles and two forced fumbles.
In 2021, first-round pick Micah Parsons set a Cowboys' rookie record with 13 sacks, tied for third-most in NFL history, and was named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Vander Esch and fellow linebacker Keanu Neal also had strong seasons and were second and third respectively on the team in tackles.
In his first year with the Cowboys in 2020, linebacker Jaylon Smith lead the team with 160 tackles, ranking second in the NFL. The defense overall also forced 23 takeaways, seventh in the NFL.
McCurley first broke into the NFL with the Green Bay Packers where he spent 13 seasons in multiple roles. He started off in coaching administration (2006-08) before spending five seasons as a defensive quality control coach (2009-13). McCurley was the team's assistant linebackers coach from 2014-17 and in 2018 was a defensive assistant.
The Packers defense recorded 44 sacks in 2018, tied for eighth in the NFL, while Blake Martinez had a team-high 147 tackles. In his role as assistant linebackers coach, he worked with assistant head coach/linebackers coach Winston Moss with the linebackers as a whole, with an emphasis on inside linebackers. Martinez led the team in tackles that season as well with 158, eighth best in team history. He also worked with Clay Matthews on his switch to inside linebacker,
McCurley, who was born in New Castle, Pa. and attended Mohawk Area High School, joined the University of Pittsburgh football team as a walk-on linebacker and went on to earn a scholarship after his red-shirt season. He was a four-year letterwinner (1999-2002) and graduated in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in movement science with a coaching minor. He spent three years as a graduate assistant at Pitt, before breaking into the NFL ranks.

A black and gold work of art
Steelers.com
We all have been there.
You see an email sitting in your inbox, you take a quick look at it, and it's nothing you were expecting. The first reaction is, it's junk mail.
So, you do what's been hammered into your head to do with emails like that.
You delete it.
That's exactly what Nina Zivkovic did when she saw an email with the Steelers mentioned in the subject line before the 2021 Steelers season. As someone who grew up a fan of the Cleveland Browns, she didn't see the need to open it.
But there was something telling her maybe she should look at it. Maybe it was legit. And after all, now that she was living in Pittsburgh, an email with the hometown team in the subject line might be worth a look.
And she was right.
The email was from Dan Rugh, the owner of Pittsburgh based CommonWealth Press. And it was offering her the opportunity of a lifetime. The company had just agreed to work with the Steelers on printing a new Game Day Poster Series and they were looking for artists to do the design work. Rugh had seen Zivkovic's work and wanted her to be a part of the new venture.
"It's kind of crazy thinking back on it," said Zivkovic. "I was going through my emails, and I saw something Steelers in my inbox. And I thought it was just a random newsletter and I deleted it. Something made me stop and I had a weird feeling that maybe I should have looked at that email before I deleted it. I opened it up and it's from Dan at CommonWealth press and he said we like your work."
The email was totally unexpected by Zivkovic, but something that got her juices flowing and she knew immediately she wanted to be a part of it.
"CommonWealth Press found me, and they linked us all up together with the Steelers," said Zivkovic, who has designed five posters over four seasons. "It was a feeling I had that I went right back to that email, because I would have regretted it.
"It's been such a fantastic collaboration for a few years now. This has been amazing, and I'm completely taken aback by it. I never thought I would work with an organization like the Steelers at this level. I've worked with the Steelers at an agency for ads and stuff for the visitor's guide. But not on my own. I never thought I would experience this. I love art, I love illustration, and it's a complete honor every time I do a poster. It's crazy."
Zivkovic is the Design Director of Ready®, one of the fastest-growing sports nutrition brands in America. She is a member of the Pittsburgh Society of Illustrators and has done work with Women Who Rock™, Melinda and the Night Sky, Stage AE, Primanti Bros., P3R Marathon, Giant Eagle and more.
She designed her first poster for the Steelers for the Week 9 game against the Chicago Bears in 2021, combining her love of comic book art with football history to come up with her design.
Since then, it's continued to grow.
"I get a little bit inspired by comic book art," said Zivkovic. "My brother was an artist before me. He's two years older than me. And he would draw comic book covers and cool comic book art. I thought, if he can do it, I can do it. My whole family is very creative, so I'm just naturally always in a creative environment, whether it's music, movies or pop culture. I get inspired a lot through those elements and sports, too.
"Every year it's been a little bit different. The first year it was more of here's what you can't do, focus on the team in general. The second year, we really dove into the themes, and I had the Buccaneers, and it was for the Crucial Catch game. And it's just grown."
The posters are sold at the Steelers Pro Shop on game days, with the proceeds benefitting Artists Image Resource (AIR), a Pittsburgh laboratory designed to serve artists, educators, and the community.
Seeing her work for sale at the Pro Shop is something that she will never tire of.
"I still haven't gotten used to it yet," said Zivkovic. "When I see my poster in the Steelers Pro Shop, I think how is this possible. I still feel as fresh as I was when I first started. It still blows my mind when I think of how I got here.
"I grew up loving football, so this is the perfect combination of how I can bring all my creativity with my love of the sports atmosphere. It's just been a great combination."
And yes, it might have been mentioned earlier that she grew up a Browns fan.
The good news is, she has been converted.
Through her work with the Steelers the past few years, and living in Pittsburgh for 15 years, black and gold is now a part of her.
"My whole adult life I have lived in Pittsburgh," said Zivkovic. "I love Pittsburgh. I grew up in Cleveland. That's why I want to preface that. I was a Browns fan, but I was a general football fan. I loved the atmosphere around it.
"But I love you guys. I tell people, the Steelers are great, the people are great, the fans are electric. I went to a preseason game and there was so much energy.
"I never thought I would say it, but because of that first poster series, I love the Steelers. You guys are fantastic. How could I not be one. I am 100 percent a Steelers fan."

Top 2024 Moments: Steelers hold multiple block parties
Steelers.com
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is another in a series of articles looking back at some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
The special teams showed up in a number of ways this season for the Steelers, and they were also heard from repeatedly.
The distinctive sound of a kicked ball being blocked was music to the ears of special teams coordinator Danny Smith.
That was audible three times in three consecutive games during one especially effective special teams stretch.
"Danny (Smith) preaches the 'block culture' every single week," defensive lineman Dean Lowry maintained. "'Mike T' (head coach Mike Tomlin) brings that term up a lot, so does Danny. I think it comes with energy and having a good gameplan going into Sunday.
"Definitely more emphasis on special teams and 'block culture' and just changing a game momentum-wise, and what it can do for a team."
Defensive lineman Isaiahh Loudermilk blocked a 38-yard field goal attempt on Oct. 6 against Dallas.
Outside linebacker Jeremiah Moon swatted a punt on Oct. 13 at Las Vegas.
And Lowry rejected a 35-yard field goal attempt on Oct. 20 against the New York Jets.
The Steelers became the first NFL team since the 2017 Patriots to block a kick in three consecutive games.
That's a feat the Steelers hadn't achieved since 1991.
"We should have had two," in the Jets game, Lowry maintained.
He was referencing a blocked extra point in the Jets game by free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick that was nullified by a leverage penalty.
Tomlin reported a few days later the NFL office had subsequently informed him Fitzpatrick's block should not have been penalized.
The effort was nonetheless appreciated.
"Can't say enough about our block units," Tomlin said. "It's not just an agenda for us. We try to live it. We develop skills in that area.
"I just can't say enough about Danny and that group, and how they make that vision reality."
Smith, who completed his 12th season with the Steelers in 2024, spoke in midseason about how much he appreciates working for a team that understands the impact that can be made on special teams, and one that has players committed to the special teams cause.
"I'm going to tell you what, it's these guys," Smith insisted. "They work their butts off for me. And that isn't easy, and that doesn't happen everywhere. I've been in different places and been in different setups and different cultures and things like that. These guys are special, all of them. I just love being around these guys. I truly love it.
"I only want to work where (special teams are) important. There are some places that it's not important. It's fun to be at a place where it's very important and, you know, to get to know the players, to get to know the coaches, to get Mike ultimately with it. It's always been important to him and he makes it and I make it important to the players and, obviously, they've taken off with it."

Triple Take: Ranking the top 2025 QBs in the Draft
The Triple Take crew of Dale Lolley, Matt Williamson and Mike Prisuta take a look at the top prospects in the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft, which will be held in April. Today, they delve into the quarterback position.
The opinions expressed here are their own and not those of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Dale's Take
The 2024 NFL Draft quarterback class could turn out to be one of the better ones the league has seen in a while.
Second-overall pick Jayden Daniels was a runaway winner of the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award after turning the Commanders around, while Chicago's Caleb Williams, Drake Maye with the Patriots, Denver's Bo Nix and Michael Penix with the Falcons all had good moments or seasons in 2024. And that group doesn't include Minnesota's J.J. McCarthy, who missed his entire rookie season with an injury.
All told, six quarterbacks were selected in the first round of the 2024 draft. This year's class won't see nearly that many.
Miami (Fla.) quarterback Cam Ward should be the top quarterback selected in this draft after a record-breaking career, but if he is compared to last year's group, he would struggle to break into the top 5. It's that kind of year.
That doesn't mean, however, there aren't some interesting prospects. Beyond Ward, Colorado's Shedeur Sanders seems like he has a reasonably high floor without perhaps not as much upside. He and Ward could be the only quarterbacks selected in the first round this year.
But there could be some interesting Day 2 and 3 players at the position who have plenty of upside for the teams willing to allow them to develop, including Tanner Shough of Louisville, Indiana's Kurtis Rourke, Jalen Milroe of Alabama, Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss and Ohio State's Will Howard.
All have plenty of experience, something we'll continue to see more of, particularly at this position, as more quarterbacks are staying in school longer because of NIL money.
Dale's Rankings
1. Cam Ward, Miami (Fla.), 6-1 5/8, 219 lbs. - Ward has a plus-arm and can make all the throws. But he sometimes misses with his accuracy when he lets his footwork get away from him. Ward isn't a runner, per se, but he can create extra time to throw with his mobility. He's not a statue. His upside isn't outstanding, but he should develop into a solid starter. He's a clear choice as the top quarterback in this draft.
2. Shedeur Sanders, Colorado, 6-1 1/2, 212 lbs. - Sanders is a good prospect but doesn't excel at any one thing. He's a pocket passer with above-average ball placement and what looks to be an average-level NFL arm. But he's also tough and will stand in the pocket to deliver the ball. That willingness to hold the ball also led to a bunch of sacks, but there's enough there to believe he could develop into an average NFL starter.
3. Tanner Shough, Louisville, 6-4 7/8, 219 lbs. - A seven-year college player, Shough will be 26 in September. So the question is whether his development in 2024 was because he had gotten better or was it because he was a 25-year-old playing against much younger players? But his arm talent is excellent and he makes "Wow!" throws. If his game can be refined, he could be a steal. Shough was in college so long, he picked up four degrees.
4. Jaxson Dart, Mississippi, 6-2 1/4, 223 lbs. - Dart is coming from an offense that generally schemed receivers wide open leads to the question of how his skillset will transfer to the NFL level. The Senior Bowl alleviated some of those concerns. He has good size and arm strength, while he's a better runner than perhaps given credit. Dart has a lot of tools in his box. But he might take some time to develop at the NFL level because he wasn't asked to read defenses a lot in college.
5. Will Howard, Ohio State, 6-4 1/4, 236 lbs. - After transferring from Kansas State, Howard took some time to adjust to playing at Ohio State. But he was great down the stretch in the college playoffs and has some scrambling ability. He won't be throwing to wide receivers, however, who are simply better than the defenders against which they are playing at the NFL level. But there are some definite tools with which to work.
Sleeper: Kurtis Rourke, Indiana, 6-4 1/4, 220 lbs. – A transfer from Ohio, Rourke helped transform Indiana from an also-ran to a college playoff team. He won at Ohio and he won at Indiana. His play tailed off at the end of the season when the Hoosiers faced stiffer challenges, but as we learned at the conclusion of the season, he played the entire year with a torn ACL. Nobody is going to question his toughness.
Matt's Take
Not only did three quarterbacks go in the top three picks in last year's draft, but six were selected in the top 12. And for the most part, last year's crop acclimated extremely well during their rookie seasons in the NFL. This year's class will not rival the one from a year ago. That being said, there are plenty of intriguing signal callers in this group that will be drafted outside of the first round that could make their new teams very happy. As always, landing spot and situation will go a long way in dictating these young men's future, but don't make the mistake that this class of quarterbacks won't bear fruit over the next several years.
After an exceptional playoff run that resulted in an Ohio State National Championship, Will Howard narrowly missed my top five.
Despite major concerns with Jalen Milroe's short and intermediate accuracy, his intelligence and extreme athletic ability-particularly Milroe's speed and acceleration-are salivating if nurtured properly. Milroe could really put on a show at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Several other names to know from this class are Texas' Quinn Ewers, Oregon's Dillon Gabriel, Indiana's Kurtis Rourke, and Syracuse's Kyle McCord. One of these four could end up in the top five by the time the draft rolls around in late April and don't be surprised if down the line, one emerges as an NFL starting quarterback.
Also, believe it or not, my gap between Sanders and Shough is extremely narrow. That was a coin flip for me for No. 2.
Matt's Rankings
1. Cam Ward, Miami (Fla.), 6-1 5/8, 219 lbs. - Ward has all the playmaking traits you look for in a modern-day quarterback and really shined this past year at Miami after transferring from Washington State. His confidence is obvious, and he inspires those around him. Ward has an excellent arm and can easily change arm slots, a strong build and excellent overall athletic ability.
2. Tyler Shough, Louisville, 6-4 7/8, 219 lbs. - Louisville is Shough's third college over seven years and he will turn 26 in September. Injuries have contributed to Shough's length stay at the college level. But it is easy to see why Shough was heavily recruited by Oregon to be Justin Herbert's successor, and he has some similarities to the Chargers current signal caller. Shough had an excellent final season and stood out at the Senior Bowl. He could be an NFL starting quarterback.
3. Shedeur Sanders, Colorado, 6-1 1/2, 212 lbs. - Not nearly the athlete that is father is, Sanders is pretty much a pure passer with some improvisational skills. He can hold the ball too long and take too many sacks, but Sanders passing skills to all levels of the field are outstanding.
4. Jaxson Dart, Mississippi, 6-2 1/4, 223 lbs. - Dart is well-built with plus athleticism and a strong arm. He plays with an aggressive mentality that usually works in his favor. The concerns with Dart center around the offensive system at Mississippi. Rarely was Dart asked to be a progression reader and many of his reads were made for him with scheme. There is plenty with which to work with here, though.
5. Jalen Milroe, Alabama, 6-1 7/8, 217 lbs. - Milroe is an elite athlete and runner. He has incredible speed. Milroe is a fine deep passer with a strong frame and is considered to be a very intelligent young man. That being said, Milroe's short and intermediate accuracy currently leave an awful lot to be desired and his hand measurement at the Senior Bowl is also quite concerning.
Sleeper: Taylor Elgersma, Laurier (Canada), 6-4, 216 lbs.- Elgersma put himself on the map at the Senior Bowl. He has good size, an NFL arm and enough athletic ability. Like all quarterbacks in this draft class, Elgersma must adjust to am NFL football - the Canadian football is much different than the one used in college in the United States. Not only that, but Elgersma also must adjust to a narrower field than what is played on in Canada. There also are 11 players on the field at a time instead of 12 in Canada! But Elgersma didn't look out of place in Mobile and might just stick at the next level.
Mike's Take
The 2024 NFL Draft will be remembered for quarterbacks, for three taken on the first three selections, for six summoned within the first 12 picks and for the rapid transitions from prized prospects to promising starters as rookies of the five who were healthy enough to eventually play (Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, Michael Penix and Bo Nix).
But that was then and this is now.
"It's certainly not last year," Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy said in late January, prior to the NFL's annual takeover of Mobile, Ala. "I don't know if any of these guys would be in the top six last year."
There's still plenty of time for perceptions to change.
But this year, it seems, there are more questions than projections.
Mike's Rankings
1. Cam Ward, Miami, Fla. 6-1 5/8, 219 lbs. - He has more life in his arm," NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said of Ward vs. Sanders during coverage of Senior Bowl week. "He's a little more explosive as an athlete. I just think he can expand your playbook a little more. He's just a bigger, sturdier, stronger dude."
2. Jaxson Dart, Mississippi, 6-2 1/4, 223 lbs. - Jaxson Dart is of the opinion being a quarterback at Ole Miss requires the mastering of "fine details. "There's a big misconception about it," maintained Dart, citing the quality of coaching he's received at Mississippi from, among others, Lane Kiffin, Joe Judge and Charlie Weiss. It's a theory that has some merit.
3. Jalen Milroe, Alabama, 6-1 7/8, 217 lbs. - NFL Network analyst Charles Davis has compared Milroe's physical skill set to the Colts' Anthony Richardson. "When (Milroe) takes off and runs, defenses have issues," Davis maintained.
4. Shedeur Sanders, Colorado, 6-1 1/2, 212 lbs. - Potential questions regarding Sanders' arm strength won't be answered until Colorado's Pro Day in the wake of Sanders' decision not to throw at the NFL Scouting Combine.
5. Tyler Shough, Louisville, 6-4 7/8, 219 lbs. - Tyler Shough has a big body, big hands and a big arm. He'll also be a 26-year-old rookie after a seven-year college career that included stints at Oregon, Texas Tech and Louisville.
Sleeper: Dillon Gabriel, Oregon, 5-11 1/8, 205 lbs. - The only thing sleepy about Gabriel is his lack of prototypical size, which is a legitimate concern but not a trait that can't be overcome. The argument for Gabriel is he was tall enough in college to start more games (63) and produce more touchdowns (188) than any quarterback in FBS history. In interviews he exudes the traits he's said he prides himself on, confidence and authenticity. And his Oregon teammate, wide receiver Tez Johnson, has said Gabriel possesses "the heart of a lion." Size matters, but there are exceptions to every metric. Don't bet against Gabriel becoming one for somebody.

Q. Last season going into Week 18, you were in the exact situation in which the Bengals currently find themselves – needing a win against a division opponent on the road plus some help to get into the playoffs. Does that experience give you any insight into what to expect tonight in terms of the levels of desperation and what the Bengals might be willing to do or attempt? A. I know our mind-set and our approach to business. I'm not going to pretend to know theirs. Certainly, I know where our heads were and our agenda and what we were willing to do to pursue it, and so I oftentimes proceed with that assumption. This is a big game. This is do-or-die for them. I don't expect them to preserve any bullets, as an analogy. They're going to fire all their bullets. They're going to utilize their weapons, their core weapons. When you're up against it, you go to core guys, proven guys, hot hands, etc. And so if there's any assumptions from our perspective about their mind-set it is that.
Q. Relating to down-and distances, is fourth-and-short an automatic go for it? A. I think those things play out much later in the contest, but I don't anticipate them to fire those type of bullets early in the contest. I expect them to play situational decision-making to their regular standard. But certainly those discussions are on the table as time becomes a factor, depending on what the score is.
Q. In assessing your team's recent performances, you mentioned that the turnover culture had been compromised, and that assessment is supported by stats showing that during the three-game losing streak the Steelers had their takeaways per game fall from 2 to 1 to none, and the turnover ratio per game go from plus-1 to minus-1 to minus-2. What specifically has been the cause of that? A. We've gotta display and live our agenda, and it's as simple as that. There's nothing mystical about it. We've had balls on the ground in the kicking game, on the punt team specifically, in the last several weeks, dislodged the ball. Mark Robinson dislodged one. James Pierre dislodged one. In Baltimore, we didn't get those balls on the ground. You've got to get those. We had a ball tipped up in the air on the 30-yard line last week on the defensive side. Patrick Queen had a chance to catch it, and he didn't. And so, it's not anything mystical. It's not like we need to do anything procedurally different. We've got to make makeable plays. Oftentimes I say, make routine plays routinely. It's the same thing on the other side. When Pat Freiermuth fumbled the ball on the 30-yard line or so last week against Kansas City, he had the ball in his inside arm. Balls are going to get dislodged, get ripped away when you don't protect it. It's a very fundamental thing to put the ball in the outside arm and use the sideline as a form of protection, in terms of warding off defenders and protecting the football. And so we're not going to pretend like it's mystical. We're not going to pretend like we're unlucky. We're not going to change our approach to business in terms of the things that we emphasize day to day to create it. We've just got to continue to work hard, and I expect our fortunes to change.
Q. On the other side, the Bengals have 11 takeaways since your first meeting on Dec. 1 in Cincinnati. Based on your preparation for today's game vs. the Bengals, what specifically has been the cause of that? A. Probably just deciding who they are. There has been a reduction of schematics on that side and some tailoring of schematics to meet their current circumstance. They've absorbed some attrition with guys like (linebacker) Logan Wilson being unavailable to them, and so they've changed some third-down personnel groupings, for example. A guy like (safety) Geno Stone is doing what they acquired him to do. (Since Dec. 1) I think Geno has had three interceptions. He had 7 interceptions last year as a member of the Baltimore Ravens. He's a member of that Bengals team because of his ability to get the ball, and so oftentimes it's an individual guy gaining traction within a role, and the No. 1 catalyst during that span for me has been Geno Stone and his takeaway ability that was on display, and that's the reason why they acquired him.
Q. Generally speaking, is having team chemistry a result of winning, or is winning the result of having team chemistry? A. You know, it's the chicken or the egg. It depends on your perspective of what mood you're in. For me, I try to feed both. Obviously, winning is our business, and we better handle business. And you better get a collection of good guys. I think it starts there – assembling good guys who happen to be good players. If you have those ingredients, then you can cook the team chemistry that is somewhat mystical if you really get in a thick discussion about it.
Q. When coming up with a division of labor at running back with Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, what are the factors that you consider? Game plan? Hot hand? Opponent specific? A. It's all of the above. There are some complexities to that, just like there are some complexities in terms of how we divide the labor up with Elandon Roberts and Payton Wilson, or with Cam Sutton and Beanie Bishop, or with the tight ends for that matter. When you have multiple guys and capable guys with varying skill-sets at a position, oftentimes the circumstance, the environment, who's hot, who's not – any and all of those things can play a major component in terms of decision-making.
Q. Do you run different kinds of plays when each of those running backs are on the field? A. We certainly can, but oftentimes they're very similar plays. And sometimes it's just about a level of fatigue of one particular guy. He may have had four or five carries within a six or seven play sequence, but we like the schematic circumstances that we're in. We'll just swap out the runner and continue to run the same battery of plays. So that's what I mean, and I'm not trying to avoid your question. It's just multi-layered and oftentimes complex when you're dealing with guys with varying skill-sets and how you divide up the labor and how to best make sure the collective continues to roll. From week to week in some instances, on a third-and-2, it might mandate that we use the Elandon Roberts on defense; in another week, it might be a purely passing circumstance that dictates we use Payton Wilson. But if you're just defining it by, "who do you use on third-and-2," the situation gets more complex.
Q. In Cincinnati's game against Denver last week, the Broncos sacked Joe Burrow 7 times and had 15 hits on the QB. Four of the sacks and more than half of the hits came from the defensive linemen instead of their edge rushers. Is pressure up the middle from the interior, the way you have to rush Burrow? A. You better do a really good job of a collective rush. His ability to extend, his ability to escape is very challenging, and so sometimes production in that area can be reflected by numbers from the interior or numbers from the perimeter. But the bottom line is that if you're lacking in any area, he's generally going to find the escape lane. He can go lateral. He can go vertical. He can go vertical to get lateral and run horizontal to the line of scrimmage while he's surveying downfield. He just has a unique skill-set and a low pulse rate that allows him to extend plays. Although specifically in that instance, the stats can be associated with a particular component of the rush, you better be solid all the way around, down in and down out. If not a guy like him is going to get you.
Q. Before the first meeting with the Bengals this season, you talked about having "enough defense" for Burrow. Now that this is the second meeting, does "enough defense" also mean "different defense?" A. Absolutely. You've just got to live that life. A guy like him, who's in total command of his schematics has a lot of mental space and time to analyze your schematics. That's the best way to really delve into the discussion. Last time, we were talking about guys like Matt Stafford and Burrow and Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, now that he's really tenured in Buffalo, anybody who has been in the same system of offense and really has an understanding of what's required of them and where their eligibles are, they've got continuity, not only with their eligibles, but with their schematics and coaching staff. It requires defense, because all of that sums up into their ability to really digest what it is that you're doing. To focus their energies, pre-snap, on your movement, on your positioning, on your personnel, because what they're asked to do becomes so second nature to them. That's why I say it so definitively when we're talking about having enough defense when you play these tenured guys who are in total command of their offensive system of football and know where all their eligibles are, you better level the playing field. You better not allow them to get really comfortable with what they're seeing, because when they do, that's when they have those days that potentially become historic. And you know, that's not conducive to us winning.
Q. Does different mean different than anything you've done before? A. Different can be dramatically different in terms of new defenses, but different can also be subtle, just in terms of different disguises or different positioning or the exchanging of zones. And so different can mean a lot of things, but you better be open to the general discussion as you prepare to play a guy like him.
Q. Wide receivers Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase have a combined 26 touchdown receptions. How are they used schematically to create opportunities for each other? A. Whoever has only one guy on him gets the ball. We can make it complex, but at the end of the day they've got really talented receivers, and you only have so many defenders. And oftentimes, when I really watch Joe, I think he drops back in those red zone circumstances and whoever's got one guy on him is getting the ball.
Q. Are there specific areas of the field where one of them is especially effective, or where one is often targeted? A. Obviously a guy like Tee, because of his stature – 6-foot-4, 225 – is a red zone issue and matchup for the defense. But Chase is a unique guy. He leads the league in all receiving statistical categories – receptions, yards, touchdowns, targets. And so this is a unique group that presents a unique challenge. And so they can strike from just about anywhere.
Q. T.J. Watt was voted Steelers MVP for the fifth time, which is the most since the award was first presented in 1969. What can be deduced from the fact that it was his fifth win and that he has won it in 2019, 2020, 2921, 2023, and 2024? A. I think it really just speaks to his level of consistency. When available, this guy plays at an extremely high level. You couple that with the fact he sees schematic challenges week in and week out. Very rarely does he get a one-on-one matchup, just like we were talking about with the Cincinnati receivers. There are two on him at all times, and yet he still delivers. And I think it speaks to his greatness. I think his teammates see that, and the consistency in which they vote for him in terms of being MVP reflects not only his production, but the schematic adversity that he sees week in and week out, down in and down out, and yet he still delivers. I imagine the great basketball players, LeBron and others see consistent double-teams and still they're at the top of the food chain in terms of statistics, and that's why they are who they are. It is no different in our in our game.
Q. Earlier this week, you started the 21-day clock on ILB Cole Holcomb (PUP), WR Roman Wilson (IR), and Logan Lee (IR). Would you characterize that as due diligence, or is there a real possibility that any of them might be able to contribute this season? A. It's both. We're at that time of the year where we get an opportunity to start that clock, because there are a limited number of days left in our football journey, and so it's time to burn the boats. But it also reflects a mentality. We're open to contributions from any and every capable man who is healthy, and attrition becomes a component of the discussion this time of year. And so it's good to have three very capable guys who are healthy and working and positioning themselves to be relevant if called upon.

5 for Friday: Focus turns to defensive line
Contributing Writer/Editor
MOBILE, Ala. - One of the biggest mysteries to the 2024 season for the Steelers was the team's failure at times – and particularly down the stretch – to be able to stop the run.
At times, the Steelers were very good in that respect, finishing sixth in the NFL allowing 98.7 yards per game on the ground.
But in losses to the Ravens at the end of the regular season and then in the playoffs, the Steelers allowed 220 and then 299 yards, showing an inability to slow either running back Derrick Henry or quarterback Lamar Jackson.
"On the defensive side, it starts with stopping the run, and we didn't do that down the stretch," team president Art Rooney II said at his season-ending press conference earlier this week. "We need to figure out how we get stronger. Hopefully with a defensive front."
Part of the conundrum lies with All-Pro defensive tackle Cam Heyward. When Heyward was on the field this season, the Steelers allowed 3.7 yards per carry. When he was not, they allowed 5.1 yards per rushing attempt.
And at 35, expecting Heyward to play 80 percent of more of the defensive snaps as he used to do as a younger player just isn't realistic.
Heyward still played 70 percent of the defensive snaps this season, but that number isn't likely to go up in future years.
So it makes sense that head coach Mike Tomlin took a particular interest in watching the defensive linemen work out here at the Senior Bowl practices this week.
The Steelers have added some young defensive linemen to the mix in recent years, including using second- and third-round picks on Keeanu Benton and DeMarvin Leal in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Much like they did with the offensive line over the previous two drafts, when they selected five offensive linemen, several of them with premium picks, it might be time to do the same with the defensive front.
While Heyward showed in 2024 he can still play at an All-Pro level, the Steelers need reinforcements there. There can't be a nearly 1 ½-yard difference in what opposing teams gain on the ground determined by when Heyward is in the game and when he is not.
That's too much of a disparity to ignore.
• The Philadelphia Eagles finished the 2023 season by losing five of their final six games after a 10-1 start and were then dispatched in the first round of the playoffs, 32-9, by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a game that wasn't as close as the final score. They staggered down the stretch after a strong start.
The Eagles did not, however, make wholesale changes or blow up the team and start over. They continued adding to their roster, signing running back Saquon Barkley and linebacker Zack Baun in free agency and addressing an obvious need at cornerback by selecting Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean in the first two rounds of the NFL Draft.
Their weaknesses in those areas became a strength.
Quarterback Jalen Hurts is a good player, but he's not considered one of the top players at the position in the league, certainly not in the class of Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, Buffalo's Josh Allen or Baltimore's Jackson.
But the Eagles have a talented roster.
Picking where they are in this year's NFL Draft and considering the players likely available in free agency, the Steelers aren't going to suddenly find themselves among the teams that have a true star at quarterback anytime soon.
They can, however, continue to build on what was a better roster in 2024 than the one they put on the field in 2023.
"I think we just have to keep building a strong roster," Rooney said. "We need to do what we need to do to take the next step. We still have strengths that we can build on to get there. And the quarterback position is a key, key piece of the puzzle that needs to be addressed. That's priority number one."
It's obviously the top priority this offseason, as all three of the quarterbacks employed by the Steelers in 2024 – Russell Wilson, Justin Fields and Kyle Allen – are all slated to become unrestricted free agents this offseason.
But continuing to build the roster is critical. The last thing the team would want is to bring in a talented young quarterback – or even a talented older quarterback – onto a roster devoid of talent.
That was what happened with the Steelers in 2004. Rookie Ben Roethlisberger was good that season. But he joined a roster that included a very solid offensive line and a defense that had stars across the board.
A team that had gone 6-10 in 2003 jumped to 15-1 the next season.
• The idea that the Steelers need more coaches on their staff to compete and that's one reason they haven't won a playoff game in recent seasons is an interesting opinion.
The Tennessee Titans had 31 coaches, including head coach Brian Callahan this season. They're picking first overall.
The Cleveland Browns also have 31 coaches, including head coach Kevin Stefanski, listed on their coaching depth chart. They're picking second in the NFL Draft.
In any given season, one of the teams that consistently over the years that had fewer coaches on staff than the Steelers was Bill Belichick's staff in New England. For example, in 2017, the Patriots went to the Super Bowl with 20 coaches, including Belichick on staff.
NFL rosters are limited to 53 players, not including the practice squad. Does anyone really think having one coach for every two players on the roster makes that big of a difference between winning and losing a game?
The Steelers currently have 27 people on staff who either directly serve as position coaches or help in some form or fashion with the on-field product as coaches.
"Our coaching staff has grown and it's the size of staffs around the league," Rooney said. "I don't think we're outliers in that regard.
"On the analytic side, we have invested on that side and got more people in that department than we ever had, but we look at opportunities and technology changes. We'll have the opportunity to give ourselves better resources on that front. Certainly look at it."
Simply adding coaches just to increase the size of the staff doesn't necessarily make sense. And while there have been times in the past when the Steelers probably made a mistake by having one guy do too much – offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner also serving as the quarterbacks coach, for example – that's not the case now.
Perhaps Belichick said it best earlier this week on the "Let's Go!" podcast when talking about what makes a team successful.

"Players win games," Belichick said. "You can't win without good players. I don't care who the coach is, it's impossible … I didn't make any tackles. I didn't make any kicks."
It's always about the Jimmys and Joes more than it is the Xs and Os. Coaches can put players in position to make plays, but the players still have to make them.
• Sports Illustrated's MMQB polled a number of people who cover the NFL and ranked the top 50 games of all time recently.
Some games involving the Steelers obviously made the cut.
The Steelers' win over the Cowboys in Super Bowl X in 1976 came in at No. 33 on the list. Their rematch in Super Bowl XIII a few years later in 1979 was ranked 26th.
The Steelers' win over the Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII in 2009 ranked 14th, while the Immaculate Reception game in 1972 was No. 2.
Certainly, the games that involved the Steelers involved some of the game's greatest plays – including the most memorable play in NFL history, the Immaculate Reception – but it's surprising those Super Bowl wins and playoff wins didn't rank higher.
No. 1 on the list was the Ice Bowl between the Packers and Cowboys in 1967, a game most of the panelists are unlikely to remember, other than the fact the game has a specific name.
Check out the entire list here .
• With the Senior Bowl practices now completed, the Steelers' scouts and coaching staff will get together over the next month to begin putting together a plan of attack for the NFL Scouting Combine and pro days.
They'll come up with a list of players they want to interview and others they want to see work out in person.
It's a busy time as the NFL drives down the tracks toward the draft in late April.
The Steelers have gotten big contributions from their past few draft classes, but more is needed to continue building the roster.
With free agency starting March 12, the next couple of months will be critical.
On average, NFL rosters turn over around 40 percent of their players from year to year.
Improving on the core that will return is critical to success.

5 for Friday: Frazier, McCormick foundation building block(ers)
Contributing Writer/Editor
In the midst of the Steelers' 10-3 start to this season has been the emergence of perhaps two foundational building blocks for the future.
Or should we say foundational building blockers.
Center Zach Frazier will make his 12th start of the season Sunday when the Steelers face the Philadelphia Eagles, while right guard Mason McCormick will be in the starting lineup for his 11 game.
Typically, when a team has two rookie starters on its offensive line, it leads to trouble. But Frazier and McCormick have not been typical rookies.
Frazier, 23, had 54 starts in college at West Virginia, while the 24-year-old McCormick had 57 consecutive starts at South Dakota State.
That experience has helped both players as they've navigated some of the treacherous roads faced by rookie offensive linemen in the NFL.
"I just think there's no shortcut to experience," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "We've been in some hot circumstances with that young collective. They face some top-notch people. They're going to face some top-notch people this week. But I think anytime you're successful, there's growth in it. And we've thankfully had some success. We faced some challenges, but we've had enough success to keep this group moving and motivated, and I see signs of that growth."
As Tomlin said, they'll need it this week. In nose tackle Jordan Davis and defensive ends Jalen Carter and Milton Williams, the Eagles offer a big challenge for the Steelers' interior offensive line this week.
The 6-foot-6 Davis is generously listed at 336 pounds, massive for a nose tackle, while Carter, 6-foot-3, 314 pounds, is an emerging star as a 3-4 defensive end. Both are former first-round draft picks.
Slowing that duo will fall largely on the capable shoulders of Frazier and McCormick.
"Yeah, we know all about Jalen Carter," said McCormick, who will be tasked with lining up opposite the Eagles' emerging star on Sunday. "They have a good defensive line. They're really good across the board. It's an exciting challenge. We've got a lot of work to put in this week to prepare for it."
The Steelers have actually had a full week to prepare for this game, something they won't have in their next two games. The NFL has scheduled their rematch with the Ravens to take place on Saturday, Dec. 21 in Baltimore, and the Steelers then host the Chiefs on Christmas Day.
That will give the Steelers three games in 11 days starting Sunday. Their opponents will all face the same schedule, but for the two rookie offensive linemen, it will be a challenge.
But the Steelers already played on a short week earlier this season, when they played the Ravens on a Sunday and then had to travel to Cleveland for a Thursday night game that week.
That was a learning process for the two rookies in the starting lineup, neither of whom had ever played a game in college on such a short turnaround.
"Going into that week, it was kind of crazy. It was the first time I've ever done that, got ready that quickly to play," said Frazier. "Now that I've experienced it, I feel like going into this stretch, I'll be a lot better because I've done it before."
And it helps that he's got a partner right next to him who is going through the same exact adjustments. In fact, the entire right side of the Steelers' offensive line is essentially going through all of these things at the same time. Right tackle Broderick Jones is actually younger than McCormick and just a few months older than Frazier, even though he now has 23 career starts, 11 last season and 12 in this one.
"Playing with Zach and Brod, both young guys like myself, it's been really cool to grow and evolve in this game together," said McCormick. "I think we can just keep stacking, just keep growing together."
A big part of that growth process will happen over the coming games, not only with three games in 11 days, but with the postseason looming.
But at least the overall workload isn't completely out of the norm. Because South Dakota State advanced to the national championship in each of his final three seasons, McCormick started 15 games in each of his final three college seasons. Frazier started as many as 13 games in his time at West Virginia with bowl games included.
"It's flown by," Frazier said of his rookie season. "I don't even realize that I'm playing more games than ever before. I feel good. I'm going to keep holding myself to the standard of doing what I do every week."
• Sunday's game in Philadelphia will pit one of the NFL's rising stars at defensive tackle, Carter, against the best defensive tackle in football, the Steelers' Cam Heyward.
Carter has been great for the Eagles in this, his second NFL season.
Carter, 23, has 37 tackles, 4.5 sacks, 12 tackles for a loss, 15 quarterback hits and four pass defenses. His 12 tackles for a loss leads all NFL interior defensive linemen.
Heyward, meanwhile, leads all defensive tackles with 55 tackles. He also has eight sacks, 10 tackles for a loss, 19 quarterback hits and eight pass defenses, which also leads all NFL defensive linemen.
Both Heyward and Carter play 3-4 defensive end, but see more time at defensive tackle because they both kick inside in nickel and dime situations, which means they line up there way more than they do in a base package.
Carter might be the future of the position. But Heyward is the current king. He's having a remarkable season and should be in consideration for NFL Defensive Player of the Year along with teammate T.J. Watt.
"He is outstanding," Steelers defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said of Heyward. "I wouldn't know who I'd trade him for. There's a couple big guys that are playing well, but he's right there with them. His impact is unbelievable for us and what he does for us. I'd love to have him in that discussion. I'm not a part of that. That's not my purview. But, if he got it, would I be surprised? No. Would I be disappointed to say there's others deserving? Maybe. But, he's really deserving, as well."
• It's no secret that Steelers placekicker Chris Boswell is having a fabulous 2024 season. He might be on his way to the best season for any kicker in NFL history.
His next field goal will break his own team record of 36 made field goals set in 2021. Boswell made 36 of his 40 attempts in 2021.
Boswell also remains on pace to set the league single-season record for made field goals of 44 set by Davis Akers in 2011. Akers, however, did that on 52 attempts, which also set an NFL record.
With an NFL-best 137 points already this season, Boswell is averaging just over 10 points per game. The NFL record for points in a season by a kicker is 166 by Akers in 2011. Considering the Steelers have four more games remaining, Boswell might cruise past that.
The Steelers' record for single-season attempts is 43 set by Roy Gerela in 1973 – in a 14-game regular season. Gerela made just 29 of those attempts and was 0-5 from 50 yards and beyond.
Boswell, meanwhile, is 11-13 from beyond 50 yards this season, with his only misses coming from 58 and 62 yards.
His 11 made field goals from beyond 50 yards are the second-most in a single season in NFL history behind Houston's Kai Fairbairn, who has made 13 this season. Fairbairn has attempted 16 50-plus-yard field goals and also has the luxury of kicking indoors for his home games.
Overall, Fairbairn has made 31 of his 36 attempts this season.
Boswell's 11 successful attempts this season are more than any other Steelers placekicker made in their careers with the team. Gary Anderson and Jeff Reed are second with eight each, but Anderson was 8 of 27, while Reed was 8 of 17.
Boswell also has now made 32 field goals of 50-plus yards since the 2021 season, the most of any NFL kicker and is now 41 of 50 in his career from 50 yards and beyond. All other placekickers in team history combined made 27 of 84 attempts from 50 yards and beyond.
The only kicker who approached Boswell's accuracy from 50 yards and beyond was Kris Brown. But Brown only had five attempts with the Steelers from that distance, making four. For his career, which lasted from 1999 through 2010, Brown was 18 of 34 on 50-yard attempts.
Matt Prater holds the league record for 50-plus-yard kicks in his career with 81 makes. But Prater, who is currently on IR with the Cardinals, spent half of his career in Denver, where kickers regularly take advantage of the thin air to make longer kicks, and then Detroit and Arizona, two teams that play their home games indoors.
Prater, 40, is 81 of 108 on 50-plus-yard attempts, a 75 percent success rate – second-best in NFL history. Boswell has made 82 percent of such kicks, which is the best success rate for players with 50 or more attempts.
Second on the all-time list is Justin Tucker with 62, while Sebastian Janikowski is third with 58.
• With the Steelers' victory over the Browns, Russell Wilson improved to 6-1 as a starter this season. It also was the 121st win as a starting quarterback in his career.
Wilson, who has accounted for 12 touchdown passes and one rushing touchdown in his seven starts, has the fifth-most wins for a quarterback in his first 13 seasons.
• Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Pittonline@iheartmedia.com
If the Steelers can win two more games this season with Wilson as the starter, he'll match Ben Roethlisberger with 123 victories in his first 13 seasons.
Wilson won't catch Tom Brady (136) or Peyton Manning (141), but he also has a shot to catch Brett Favre (125) if the Steelers win their final four games this season.
Sunday, Wilson will put an undefeated streak on the line against the Eagles.
Wilson is 6-0 in his career against Philadelphia, 4-0 in the regular season and 2-0 in the playoffs, all with Seattle. In those games, he's averaged 252 passing yards with nine touchdown passes and one interception. He's also 4-0 against the Eagles in Philadelphia.
The Eagles are ranked No. 1 in total defense in 2024, allowing 284.2 yards per game. In his career, Wilson is 4-0 when facing the league's No. 1-ranked defense. He went 2-0 with Seattle and was 2-0 in Denver, beating the 49ers, 11-10, in 2022, and Cleveland, 29-12, in 2023.
• Frazier and McCormick are only two of the Steelers' rookies who are making a big impact with the team this season.
Inside linebacker Payton Wilson, a fourth-round draft pick, has played over 45 percent of the team's defensive snaps and has 55 tackles, including two for a loss, two fumble recoveries, a forced fumble, an interception and two quarterback hits. He scored a touchdown on a fumble return in a win over the Bengals two weeks ago and had perhaps a game-saving interception last month against the Ravens.
Nickel cornerback Beanie Bishop, an undrafted player, has played 61.5 percent of the team's defensive snaps and has 42 tackles, six pass defenses, three interceptions and two tackles for a loss. His three interceptions are the second-most of any NFL rookie.
And remember, first-round draft pick Troy Fautanu and third-round selection Roman Wilson have missed most of the season with injuries.
Fautanu made one start before suffering a season-ending knee injury, while Wilson was injured in training camp, briefly returned to practice and then suffered a hamstring injury that landed him on the Reserve/Injured List.
The Steelers got big contributions from Jones, cornerback Joey Porter Jr., nose tackle Keeanu Benton, tight end Darnell Washington and linebacker Nick Herbig as rookies last season. This year's class hasn't had the same number of rookies see the field extensively overall, but it's had that group's impact, all the same.
Back-to-back very good drafts is a big reason why the Steelers now find themselves at 10-3 and very close to clinching a playoff spot, something they can do Sunday with a win over the Eagles or losses by the Dolphins and Colts.
The thing to also remember is that just because a rookie doesn't make big contributions right away, doesn't mean they won't in future seasons.
After all, cornerback Cory Trice, a seventh-round pick last season, had a big interception for the Steelers earlier this season, while fellow seventh-round pick Spencer Anderson started several games early this season when the Steelers were dealing with a number of offensive line injuries.
Defensive back Ryan Watts and defensive lineman Logan Lee, a pair of sixth-round picks this season, have been on injured reserve all season and have been out of sight, out of mind for fans. But both have been around all season, learning and soaking in information that could pay dividends in 2025.

Looking ahead at Steelers' 2025 schedule
Contributing Writer/Editor
After playing one of the NFL's most difficult schedules in 2024, the Steelers get a slight reprieve in 2025.
Based on 2023 records, the Steelers' 2024 slate of games was the third-toughest in the NFL, as their opponents finished last season with a .538 winning percentage. In reality, based on the results of the season, it ended up being slightly easier than that at .502, largely thanks to a massive regression by the Browns, who went from 11 wins in 2023 to three victories in 2024.
Their 2025 schedule includes teams that posted a .523 winning percentage in the recently completed season. That puts their schedule as the 10th-most difficult slate in 2025.
But that's the thing about projecting schedules. Past results don't necessarily equal future performance.
But the Steelers do know who their opponents for 2025 will be after their second-place finish in the regular season, though they don't necessarily know when – or in the case of potential international games – where they will take place. That won't be released by the NFL until May.
What they do know is that they will play seven games against teams that qualified for the postseason in 2025, including Baltimore twice. The Steelers are scheduled to be the home team in four of those games, with the remaining three coming on the road.
The Steelers went 4-3 in the regular season against teams that qualified for the postseason in 2024, going 2-2 on the road and 2-1 at home in those matchups.
With that in mind, let's take an all-too-early look at what lies ahead for the 2025 season.
AFC North Opponents
Baltimore (12-5), Cincinnati (9-8), Cleveland (3-14) - The Steelers will play their typical home-and-away slate against their AFC North foes after going 3-3 in those regular season meetings in 2024. Baltimore, which defeated the Steelers 28-14 in the AFC Super Wild Card playoffs, is the defending division champion. The Bengals just missed the playoffs, finishing as the AFC's No. 8 seed. Cleveland, meanwhile, owns the No. 2 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after regressing from 11 wins in 2023 to three in 2024.
AFC East Opponents
The Steelers match up against the AFC East in conference games in 2025. They'll host the division-champion Bills (13-4) and second-place Dolphins (8-9), while going on the road to face the Jets (5-12) and Patriots (4-13). The Steelers have won 10 of their 13 games against the Bills in Pittsburgh. They're 9-4 in their history against the Dolphins at home. The Steelers are 21-7 in their history against the Jets, including 10-5 on the road. They have won just four of 11 games in New England, including dropping six of their past seven games there dating back to 2002.
NFC North Opponents
The Steelers host the second-place Vikings (14-3) and third-place Packers (11-6). They travel to Detroit (15-2) and Chicago (5-12) on the other side of these crossover matchups. The NFC North was the best division in the NFL this season, sending the Lions, Vikings and Packers to the postseason. Given that the Steelers get two of the three at home as opposed to playing two of those returning playoff teams on the road, this works out OK. The Steelers are 6-4 at home against the Vikings and 9-7 against the Packers, though they have won the past six home meetings against Green Bay, which hasn't won in Pittsburgh since 1970. The Steelers are just 6-12 in their history in Detroit, though three of those victories have come in their last four trips there. Meanwhile, the Steelers are just 1-12 all-time in Chicago, with that lone win coming in overtime during their 1995 run to the Super Bowl.
Other AFC Opponents
As the second-place finisher in the AFC North, the Steelers also will play the second-place finishers from the AFC West and AFC South. That means they will play the Colts (8-9) at home and the Chargers (10-7) on the road. The Steelers also played both of those teams in 2024, beating the Chargers, 20-10, in Week 3 in their home opener and losing to the Colts, 27-24, in Indianapolis the following week. The Steelers are 9-7 against the Chargers on the road in their history, including 1-1 in Los Angeles. They are 17-2 all-time against the Colts in Pittsburgh.
NFC Crossover Opponent
When the league went to a 17-game schedule a few years ago, it determined the odd game would come against a team that is an equal finisher from the division played two years previously. In this case, that means the Steelers will host the Seattle Seahawks (10-7) second-place finishers in the NFC West in 2024. The Seahawks were the one NFL team in 2024 that reached at least 10 wins that did not make the playoffs. The Steelers are 9-3 in their history at home against the Seahawks.

Off and running at the NFL Scouting Combine
Steelers.com
Kicking things off: Let the games begin.
Well, at least the NFL Scouting Combine.
After a few days of hearing from coaches and general managers in Indianapolis, players begin to hit the field today at Lucas Oil Stadium.
And it all starts with the defensive line and linebackers.
"It's a defensive line heavy draft," said NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah, who kicked off the network's coverage with Rich Eisen. "Defensive tackle, edge rushers, absolutely loaded at those two positions. And they're going to kick us off here."
Defensive line is a position many draft gurus have been praising for depth and strength, and for a team looking for an impact player or even just to boost depth, this is the year.
"I'm excited about this draft," said Jeremiah. "It's a starter's draft is how I would phrase it. Going through and watching all these guys for the Combine and talking to a bunch of people around the league, some positions maybe don't have that superstar that we have had in years past, but we do have a boatload of starters, particularly the defensive line. A bunch of really, really good players."
In several of his mock drafts, Jeremiah has the Steelers going on the offensive side of the ball in the first round, but he does think the talent is there if they opt for a defensive lineman with the 21st overall pick in the first round.
"If you are looking at Pick 21 for the Steelers, Mykel Williams (Georgia) would be a lot of fun just because the physicality they require, setting the edge, all that stuff. He checks that box," said Jeremiah. "I think he has so much upside as a rusher. I don't anticipate he'll be there at that point in time. Him and Mike Green (Marshall) are probably both gone, but either one of those picks would be to me home runs.
"Shemar Stewart is as raw as can be. There is a lot to work with. I can't imagine with someone with his physical gifts that he has, getting a chance to learn from T.J. Watt, that would be fun if he were to get where he is capable of getting talent-wise. There's a lot in his body.
"They'll have options. If they want to go with an edge rusher, they're going to have someone there that's worthy of that pick. They're not going to have to reach if that's truly the position that they wish to address."
Making an impression: With Steelers defensive line coach Karl Dunbar watching closely from the field, and conducting some of the drills himself, there were a lot of players who put on a show.
And one of them was edge rusher James Pearce Jr. from Tennessee.
Pearce showed off his speed with a 4.47 40-yard dash, the best of all the defensive linemen.
He also showed the speed in drills, something that didn't go unnoticed.
"Oh man that's pretty good," said NFL Network's Charles Davis. "That's pretty good."
It's not just his straight-ahead speed that opened eyes, but his overall movement.
"That confirmed the straight-ahead speed," said Davis. "Very good side to side. Really no loss of movement. The fluidity on it is really impressive."

All in the family: Steelers scout Mark Bruener is closely watching all of the players at the Combine, but there isn't anyone who likely has his attention more than a linebacker from the University of Washington.
And that's because it's his son.
Huskies' linebacker Carson Bruener is participating in the Combine, running a 4.59 in the 40-yard dash on both of his turns.
The young Bruener said he had gotten plenty of advice from his father, who was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft and played nine seasons for the team.
"He's given me a lot of great pointers," said Bruener. "Biggest thing is he's not a helicopter dad. He lets me enjoy this whole journey and just be myself. He'll give me pointers and tips here and there. I don't know what my true scouting report on myself really is. I haven't asked him, nor has he told me.
"He told me, 'You control what you can control, and you've done everything at this point to be where you're at.' I'm here, and this was my goal to be here, and I feel blessed to be here."
Bruener said he hasn't read any of his dad's scouting reports on himself and when he was interviewed by the Steelers at the Shrine Bowl, dad took a back seat.
"I walked in and there was a second room of interviews," shared Bruener. "There was a certain amount of teams in each one, 15-minute interviews. The Steelers were the first team I met with in that room. My dad was sitting right across the table and he kind of stood up. He was going to leave no matter what and just kind of walk into the back wall.
"He doesn't want to be a hovering parent. He'll eavesdrop and listen in. He knows everything about me already. I mean, we talk every single day, so it was something where he wanted me to get that true experience that every other player's getting, a true interview without having your dad sitting right there. That was something I really appreciated, him kind of giving me my space and letting me be able to enjoy this moment. After the fact, we were able to go get dinner and talk about everything. But both of us being there in that moment was truly special."
Plenty to talk about: During the Combine, every team has the opportunity to talk to a total of 60 players for a 15-minute interview.
Which means, there will be a lot more talking than actually drafting or signing a player, because nobody is going to add 60 rookies to their roster.
So, while people might get excited when they hear a team talk to a specific prospect, yes, it shows there is an interest, but it doesn't mean they will end up on the team.
Among the defensive linemen who spoke to the Steelers were Michigan's Kenneth Grant and Oregon's Derrick Harmon, to name a few.
"I met with the Steelers. Very serious," said Grant. "They want competitors. They want dudes that are ready to go.
"He's (Coach Mike Tomlin) a pretty cool dude. Most people think he's so serious, but he's all about his business. He's easy to communicate with."
Another player who was impressed with Tomlin was Harmon, who said Steelers defensive tackle Cameron Heyward is someone he watches in the NFL.
"That's a great guy," said Harmon. "That's a guy you can sit down and have an hour talk with, a two hour talk with, talk ball, talk life. Just a great guy to talk to."
A perfect script: A player who had the longest journey to the Combine is Boise State edge rusher Ahmed Hassanein.
Hassanein was raised in Cairo, Egypt and didn't move to the United States until he was 16-years old when his brother, who was raised in America, brought him to live with him.
It's the type of story Hollywood scripts are made of, but this one is true.
Hassanein's older brother, Cory Besch, introduced his younger brother to football and the rest is history.
Hassanein went from a kid who knew nothing about the sport and didn't speak English to a top NFL prospect.
"I don't know if I've ever met a player more eager and excited to be at the Combine than Ahmed Hassanein out of Boise State," said Stacey Dales during the NFL Network broadcast. "I just spoke to him. He's the first Egyptian player to not only play college football, but to be here at the Combine. He's going to be the first Egyptian player drafted in the NFL.
"I spoke to him and he said five years ago I couldn't speak English. He spoke Arabic and he said I didn't play football. His brother, who's watching, is a teacher and a high school coach, actually went over to Egypt, talked to the family and said let's bring him back.
"So, they brought him back over here to the U.S. to play football and he tried out at receiver. He told me he couldn't catch. They tried linebacker, and he said it was too much. So, they said, go get the quarterback. That's what he's done. "I just love this guy. His energy will blow you through the roof ."
Dales isn't the only fan of his. So is Jeremiah.
"Talk about having the odds stacked against you," said Jeremiah. "I mean, to come out of that environment with just no experience and no knowledge of the sport, and to be on the precipice of being selected as one of the top players. It's pretty incredible."
And he doesn't take for granted how incredible it is. He showed amazing energy during the drills, challenging the coaches who were running the drills as much as they were challenging him.
"Being at the Combine is an amazing feeling and I'm so grateful for it," said Hassanein. "The sky is the limit for me. I have the will to learn and I'm eager to learn. I'm grateful for this opportunity.
"Not a lot of people get to come to the Combine. Being one of them after five years of American football and five years of learning the English language, I'm so grateful. God willing I'll be the first Egyptian to ever get drafted. That's a huge honor to me and a huge honor to my country."

Out like a Lion: Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter isn't just the best of the bunch on the defensive line, but he also is predicted to be the overall No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft by many. If Carter is taken with the first overall pick, Penn State will become the sixth school to have at least three players selected first overall in the modern draft era, joining USC, Oklahoma, Auburn, Ohio State and Stanford.
Carter isn't taking part in the on-field activities at the Combine, dealing with a foot injury that according to reports from the Combine is a stress reaction in his right foot.
Carter does plan to work out at his Pro Day at Penn State near the end of March, but his time at the Combine is mainly focused on interviews, medical and such.
"I'm really just starting to heat it up right now," said Carter. "I just got cleared, really started training, started working out again. So, my next couple weeks look like just me getting right, me getting ready for my pro day and once I get to my pro day to perform at an elite level."
Performing at an elite level isn't an issue for him as Carter was a unanimous All-American and the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2024.
"I think I bring energy, effort, versatility," said Carter. "I feel like when the biggest moments come around, that's when I play at my best.
"I feel like (teams) definitely need a franchise edge rusher. If you look at all the great teams, all the great teams that won Super Bowls, you have that one standout, great defensive player and I feel like I'm that."
Confidence isn't an issue for Carter, who said it comes from the work that he has put in from the time he started playing football.
"I would say the work I put in my whole life," said Carter. "My dad, he trained me to be the best player I can be, and not just being the best on the field, but off the field. Knowing all the work I put in, all the training I did, all the sacrifices I made, I know I'm the best."
You can’t stop GREATNESS! Y’all thought I was going that easy? This just gonna make the movie more interesting! See y’all March 28th🦁 Bring ya popcorn #1 OVERALL PICK ♾️,  56 days.. InshaAllah it’s already written
Steelers influence: An interesting defensive lineman is Ole Miss do-it-all J.J. Pegues, who made the switch from tight end to defensive line and has even been used as a short-yardage running back.
"I'm comfortable playing both sides of the ball," said Pegues. "And I'm here now just because of that."
Pegues transferred from Auburn to Ole Miss after his freshman season and said it was former Steelers defensive lineman Nick Eason, who was the defensive line coach at Auburn in 2021, who had a huge impact on him.
"He really just dumbed everything down for me, he made things simple for me, simplified everything, from the pass rush to the run game and being violent," said Pegues. "I put my faith in him, and he poured into me."
In talking about him on the broadcast, Rich Eisen said it best.
"The more you can do."

Making an impression: NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales is providing insight from the field during the Combine, including sharing her take on Michigan's Mason Graham, who is not taking part in on-field drills due to a 'left heel bruise.'
"He's dealing with a left heel bruise," said Dales during the drills. "They don't want to push it. They're going to wait for his pro day at Michigan.
"But there's not a whole lot you just can't fall in love with when it comes to Mason Graham. His character is off the charts. He told us this week there's no mystery to who I am. I love football. I'm all about business. But his impact on the field is obviously really special.
"I asked him this week to describe what he thinks his game looks like or feels like, and he told me, I feel like I'm just dominant. He said I'm at least one of the most consistent players on every down. I'm dominant on every down and there isn't a down he likes to take off.
Graham was a consensus first-team All-American selection in 2024, and a second-team selection in 2023.
"Count has gone up every year at Michigan," said Dales. "He doesn't want to come off the field. They don't want to take him off the field. In fact, last season, almost 550 snaps in 12 games. But in 10 of those games, 45 plus snaps. And it's that consistency, with all that time on the field, he is most proud of. Can't wait to see him at his pro day."

Labriola on the Steelers playing in Ireland
Steelers.com
In a preface to "Dan Rooney: My 75 Years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL," former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue wrote, "Dan Rooney's life has been dedicated to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football League …"
Tagliabue could've added a third entity: Ireland.
The NFL has announced that the Steelers will host a game in Dublin, Ireland, as part of their 2025 regular season schedule, and amidst all of the excitement and anticipation surrounding that it should be noted it won't be the first time the Pittsburgh Steelers will have played in Croke Park.

That occasion was described this way by Michael McQuaid in the July 23, 2023, edition of the Irish Star: "It was a day to remember for any NFL fan on the island of Ireland. American football fans witnessed a historic event as the Pittsburgh Steelers faced off against the Chicago Bears at Croke Park in Dublin on July 27, 1997. This exhibition game was part of the NFL's American Bowl Series, which aimed to promote the sport internationally and establish a global fan base. Little did they know that this exhibition match would leave a lasting impact, not only on the players and fans who experienced it firsthand but also on the trajectory of American football's global growth."
"Well, No. 1, I thought it was great attendance for a preseason game," recalled President Art Rooney II, "and great enthusiasm in the stands. The Irish are great sports fans. They love their sports, whether it's hurling or rugby or Irish football, just a country that's into sports. It was great to see how much the Irish people enjoyed American football. It was a good game, and it was a lot of fun."
It was a lot of fun, certainly the most fun ever for an addition to what at the time was already a 4-game preseason. And there was a lot more planning and preparation involved than normal for a preseason game.
One of the first things to be done was line up an opponent willing to add a fifth preseason game to its schedule, and that had to be negotiated from team-to-team because in 1997 the league office didn't handle the preseason schedule as it does today. Dan Rooney was able to convince the McCaskey family – then the owners of the Chicago Bears – that a preseason game in Ireland was a good idea.
Then came the task of developing plans for the trip.
First, it's important to understand how an NFL team typically travels to a road game, be it preseason or regular season. Arrive by charter to the site of the game the day before kickoff – Friday before a Saturday game; Saturday before a Sunday game; Sunday before a Monday game – and board buses at the airport to go directly to the team's hotel. There the traveling party is housed and fed, and where meetings are held and any final preparations for the game are introduced. Then travel to the stadium for the game, and generally five hours after kickoff, the game has been played, interviews done, equipment gathered and packed, and it's wheels-up for the charter flight to bring the team home.
This game in Dublin, this preseason opener, this opener of a five-game preseason was anything but typical.
Both teams arrived in Dublin a week before the July 27 game, and family members were among the traveling party. In addition there was a large group of Steelers fans that traveled separately to Dublin for what amounted to a week's vacation in Ireland with Dan Rooney as the host.
And what better host than a man who in 1976 co-founded The Ireland Funds, with its "trinity of goals – peace, culture and charity," the same man who would serve as the United States Ambassador to Ireland from July 2009 until December 2012. Such was Dan Rooney's love for both his sport and for Ireland that during the annual July 4 celebration on the grounds of the U.S. Embassy he changed the day's primary activity to a game of flag football from what always had been a game of softball.
In 1997 the week included a football clinic featuring Steelers players squeezed in around their practice schedule, and remember, those practices were a part of the early phase of training camp. For the "vacationers" there were team-provided tours of Waterford Crystal, Northern Ireland, Dublin Castle, and Phoenix Park. There was a "pub crawl" that introduced the Americans to some of the nightlife to be found in the Temple Bar area, a riverside neighborhood with cobblestone streets. Closer to the day of the game, there was a barbeque for both teams in Ballsbridge.
A personal highlight for me came on our first night in Dublin. Dan Rooney had arranged a trip for the media to Johnnie Fox's Pub, described this way on its website: "Johnnie Fox's, situated in Dublin, is one of the oldest pubs in Ireland, and steeped in history since 1798. Renowned for being the highest pub in the country, nestled in the peaceful township of Glencullen and surrounded by the beautiful scenery and serenity of the Dublin Mountains. Johnnie Fox's Pub was originally a small holding farm that became a "safe haven" during the great Irish rebellion of 1798 against British Rule in Ireland. Despite the revolt ending in British victory, the year of 1798 marked a significant watershed in Irish history."
The trip there was scenic, bordering on breathtaking, and a bit frightening because the combination of the mini-bus traveling on very narrow country roads on the climb into the mountains was a world away from driving east on Route 30 toward Saint Vincent College. Arriving at Johnnie Fox's, it was as if we had traveled back in time. There was a large peat-burning fireplace that was heating the pub, and even though it was late July it was chilly up in the mountains. The Irish had used peat for centuries to heat their homes and cook food because it was a cheap alternative to coal and natural gas.
Beside the friendliness shown to us by the regulars, the highlight was the Hooley Show, a regularly scheduled bit of live entertainment that paired traditional Irish musicians performing with Johnnie Fox's Irish Dancers. My recollection was that it was an up-close-and-personal version of what was known in the U.S. at the time as Lord of the Dance. The talent and personality of the performers that night was off the charts.
But back to the game.
"If you recall, in the 1990s the only NFL international games being played in those days were preseason games," said Art Rooney II. "We had played in Barcelona (against the 49ers in 1993), in Tokyo (against the Chargers in 1996), in Mexico City (against the Colts in 2000) to be put in front of an international audience. Of course, being in Ireland was something a little more special to us and my Dad and our whole family."
It was no simple matter getting Croke Park to host Steelers vs. Bears either, because in 1997 there never had been a non-Irish sport played on that field/pitch. But because it was Dan Rooney, it wasn't impossible, either.
"I don't think there had to be a lot of arm-twisting, but it was unusual for Croke Park to host a different kind of event," said Art Rooney II. "But through being involved with the Ireland Funds for so long, my Dad had a lot of great friends at the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) that owns Croke Park. The GAA sponsors the major Irish sports – hurling and Gaelic football – and while there are matches all over the country the major ones in those sports end up at Croke Park."
Also during the run-up to the game, there was a photo op where the Waterford Crystal Trophy was on display, and among those in attendance representing the Steelers were Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, and Coach Bill Cowher. The way Dan Rooney remembered it, after seeing and being impressed with the trophy, his wife sidled up to Cowher and said something like, "I really like that trophy. We better win this game."
As for the details of the game itself, I remember Kordell Stewart starting at quarterback and playing pretty well; and Jerome Bettis, who was coming off a 1996 season where he rushed for 1,431 yards, with a 4.5 average and 11 touchdowns, and who had signed a 4-year contract worth $14.4 million that offseason as an unrestricted free agent, not only playing but playing long enough in this extra preseason game to score a touchdown.
Put all of that under the category of "message received," because Mrs. Rooney's trophy sits in a case as part of a display inside the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

CONTENT:
There is no doubt Bill Nunn would be smiling if he had seen Javé Brown and Kearstin Schweitzer walking the sidelines at Saint Vincent College the first two weeks of the Steelers 2023 training camp, keeping an eye on practice with the same eagle eye he once did in his scouting days and taking part in the daily meetings with the Steelers player personnel staff.
It would mean the world to him, because Nunn was all about bringing diversity to the NFL, one of the first scouts to dip into the immense and untapped talent pool at Historically Black Colleges and Universities back in the early 1970s.
Now, decades later, there is another talent pool that is making its way to the NFL and it's thanks to the Nunn-Wooten Scouting Fellowship, named after Nunn, the legendary scout who served in multiple roles in the Steelers personnel department beginning in 1967 in a part-time role, and then in a full-time role from 1969-2014, and was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a Contributor as part of the Class of 2021, and John Wooten, a former NFL player and front-office executive who has cemented his name in promoting diversity as well.
The fellowship is open to former NFL players, former college football players and current college football employees working in recruiting and personnel.
And women are part of the pool that are being selected to participate.
"For me, the Steelers are always first when it comes to accepting and showing the world how everybody should act," said Brown. "It was a long time ago when people like Bill Nunn, myself and Kearstin, we weren't looked at like we can do the job just because of who we were. And Mr. (Dan) Rooney thought, that's silly. And so he hired Bill Nunn and to have this named after him and for me to be a person who followed up, it's amazing."
Brown, who has worked in various roles assisting the Steelers Marketing Department since 2016, is now the Director of Programming and Logistics for the National Coalition of Minority Football Coaches, a scout with the East West Shrine Bowl and assistant coach at North Hills High School.
She has applied for the fellowship previously, but this year had the opportunity to meet members of the Steelers personnel department at the East-West Shrine Bowl and was invited to visit the team during OTAs. It was then she was encouraged to once again apply, and this time, she earned the spot.
"When I walked into the scouting room for the first time, not knowing that side of the business or the people over in that personnel group, it was just great," said Brown. "Everybody was so welcoming and so helpful. It's family here. And it's always nice to have one voice. No matter if I'm working with the marketing team or if I'm working with some of the athletes that were here before, the alumni that were here before or some of the athletes that are here now, everybody has one voice and everybody is embracing and always making you feel like family.
"I learned a lot and making sure to take that back with me when I go back to the East-West Shrine Bowl, when I go back on the field with North Hills High School."
Schweitzer, who is the director of football operations and an assistant coach at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, learned of the fellowship through social media and as she was looking to expand her career, the fellowship was something that was a dream position she worked to make a reality.
"When I got to camp, it was a whirlwind," said Schweitzer. "It was super exciting to be there. Everyone's so welcoming. You learn a lot. The guys in the scouting room know what they're talking about. They have a lot of experience. I came there with an open mind just to see what I can learn. And leaving there, I have so much more knowledge and am able to take the skills that I've learned there and use that in my programs and hopefully one day give back to the scouting world."
The first two weeks of training camp are the key time for the scouts before they hit the road for the preseason, so that is when Brown and Schweitzer spent their time at Saint Vincent College.
And the days were action packed.
Morning meetings. Afternoon practices. Evening meetings. And always time for extra film sessions and answering their questions whenever needed.
"When we went into our room or scouting room, we talked about the things that we need to do as far as the season goes," said Schweitzer. "We were a part of those conversations, which is really great. They didn't act like we're not a part of their team. Everything that they're talking about, everything that they're doing, everything that they're getting ready for, we're getting all that knowledge as well.
"We watched what's going on during practice on the field and then we'd go back and watch film just like everybody else."
Those meetings were often attended by Coach Mike Tomlin and like the scouts, he never held back information, everyone a part of the same team.
"I loved all the learning, but it was so shocking when Coach T came in to watch film with us," said Brown. "He was sitting there talking to the scouts about what he's looking for, how to break things down or how he's looking and breaking down this film. It's just so awesome how everybody is one voice around here. And I've known that. But again, being from the marketing side and then coming over to the personnel side, it's one voice. This whole organization is one voice and it's awesome."
In the same manner as the scouts did, and Coach Tomlin, both of them went into practice with a plan of what they were looking for, who they were going to focus on, what traits they wanted to see from the player to make sure they were performing on the field the same way they had seen in previous film sessions, whether it be college, NFL or any type of practice film.
"We discussed who we're going to watch, what position group, and we looked at their athletic ability," said Schweitzer. "Are they flexible? Can they change direction really well? Do they have good hands? All the different attributes that an athlete should have. What caliber are they at? Are they really good at it? Are they quick in out cuts? Do they take more steps than they should. We evaluated each position, each day. It was a different position each day."
When practice ended, evaluations were required with written reports from all.
"I'm always looking to see what's standing out, what is it that this will bring to the table if we bring in a different player, what we're looking for next year," said Brown. "We want to see what that standard is. We're looking to see if they can make plays. If they can't make that play, how do they react to that? We're looking for everything. We're looking for a skill, we're looking for emotion, we're looking for do you fit in."
Fitting in.
As women in the NFL, fitting in is something that would have been a question mark years ago.
But things have changed.
Women are now part of coaching staffs, player personnel departments, officiating and much more in the game.
"The way the league is turning right now, there are a lot of qualified females that are going to be doing various front office jobs," said Mark Sadowski, the Steelers director of player scouting who worked closely with both of them from the interview process on. "Whether it be a scouting job, player personnel coordinator position. I have seen several on the road last fall. I think the league will trend that direction.
"It's about finding the right candidates, the ones that are super passionate about football, have football in their background. Those are the candidates that we had with these two young ladies. It's extremely important to them and it showed in their presence, work ethic, willingness to learn and go above and beyond. I think the league is trending that way and there are a lot of excellent candidates out there who are going to make an impact in the league."
The role of females has grown by leaps and bounds and Brown and Schweitzer, well they are prime examples.
"I think it's about progress. It's about opportunity," said Schweitzer. "When I got into football, I didn't really think differently. I didn't think I was different than the rest. I knew I was a female in a male industry, but I didn't work any differently than what my male counterparts were. I don't think you realize it until someone else tells you because you're just here to do the work. That's the biggest thing about women in football. We're here to do the work. It doesn't matter who was around or who's next to me, I'm going to do the same work because I want to get to where everybody else is.
"We all have the same goal. You do best when we can flip programs and organizations that we work with because we love ball, and we want to be a part of it."
Brown's relationship with the Steelers through her marketing department duties started the relationship, but it was witnessing her football knowledge firsthand that opened eyes as to what she is capable of on the other side of the ball, regardless of gender.
"A job is a job regardless of any of those other factors," said Brown. "If you can do the job, then you should have the opportunity to be able to do the job. I feel like women are getting that opportunity to show that they can do the job, we're letting some people understand that. To say, hey I was wrong, you can do the job. You do belong here. It doesn't matter what you look like, as long as you can get the job done. That's what we should be looking for. These types of fellowships and internships that are available for everybody to get on the same page, just understand that if you can do the job, then we want you here. We want the best person for the job because that's what we're looking for."
Knowing that they are helping to break down some of the barriers in sports is something they don't think about regularly, as they just consider themselves scouts and coaches, not female scouts and coaches. But there is the understanding they are opening doors for others, giving those after them the opportunity to reach their goals because the standard is now set.
"Representation matters," said Brown. "Whenever you see somebody who looks like you, regardless of it's race or gender, background, then you feel hopeful. And that's the reason why I do it. I also want people who are coming up to feel that same hope.
"I work with kids because I work in a high school and I want them to think that there's other things that they can do out there, that they're not in a box. When you see women that are out here and they're doing things that they thought that they couldn't do, it just makes it all the better for them. And they can strive to be something that they thought that they couldn't."
What made them feel welcomed into the male dominated world was the Steelers personnel department. From General Manager Omar Khan on down, including Dan Rooney Jr., Sheldon White, Mark Sadowski, Dan Colbert and everyone else, they were open and welcoming, treating them the same as anyone in the scouting room.
"They welcomed us with open arms," said Schweitzer. "They were always asking if we needed to know anything, or what else can they do to help us. Asking if we wanted to watch more film. Do we want to go over more, learn different aspects of scouting, meet with them. We've had multiple meetings at night just going over different film and positions and looking at what they look for, and they're really descriptive. They didn't really hide anything. They're open books to us and they want us to know as much as we want to know."
Both Brown and Schweitzer are back in their regular full-time roles at their schools, but they have taken with them not just memories, but more importantly lessons that they can use now and moving forward in their professional endeavors.
"I brought back what I've learned in practice, the type of tempo they have," said Schweitzer. "To be an NFL program, you have to compete because you're competing against the best. Where we're at, we're a Division III program that is highly competitive. If we can get our standard up to practice like an NFL team, that can give us chances to win a conference championship. That's our goal this season.
"Just being able to evaluate players more, have more of that professional side, more of an idea of what it's like to be a scout and what scouts are looking for. Even though we're a Division III program, we do get draftable candidates, kids that can possibly make it, so bringing all that knowledge back to Platteville is going to be helpful for me. We do have a few guys on our roster that are going to be looked at this year and being able to be almost that pro liaison, having more of that knowledge, I'm hoping to help our guys be able to get into the league and help the league guys get to know our guys."
What they also took back with them is something they have always had, a love for the game of football that challenges them to take their own game to the next level.
"I love the competitiveness, but also the brotherhood," said Brown. "It's one of a kind here. Everybody is a family. And I understand that it's brotherhood and sisterhood at this point. It's the family, being on a team and being a part of something. Even if you think that you're not contributing, you absolutely are. When you think that people are not watching you or they don't appreciate, football, you can't do your job without the person next to you, period."

Boykin wants to carry on the tradition
Steelers.com
In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today, receiver Miles Boykin shares why Black History Month is important to him and how hearing from those who came before him has inspired and touched him.
There are lessons we all learn in life that come from so many sources, but for receiver Miles Boykin, when it comes to Black History Month, there is no greater source than his grandmother, Cornelia Brigmon.
"Black culture is such a part of American culture," said Boykin. "I think we need to relay that to everybody and recognize its importance in the United States today.
"For me, listening to my grandma is one of the best ways to do it. My grandma would always tell me stories. She is turning close to 80-years old now, so she has some crazy stories. She was born during segregation. I can't even remember the whole specifics, but it was her mom or her grandmother who was born a slave and then they were eventually able to leave out of it. Just some of the stories that she tells me really makes me grateful for what I have today and grateful for those who came before me."
The stories, many of which Boykin likes to just keep close to the vest, have been eye-opening for him and given him an even greater appreciation for those who came before him.
"You hear some of the things and it's almost unfathomable, but it seemed so normal to her," said Boykin. "And now, she's just so grateful for everything. I truly think the older people are, the more appreciation they have for a lot of the things they had to go through. That's all we want for anybody. Hopefully when I'm 80-years old, I'll be able to say the same thing to my kids, and my grandkids, that they have been blessed in the world that they live and try to make it better for everybody.
"To me it means everything to hear stories from her because obviously oral history is so much better. The first-hand encounters are better than learning something from a book or watching it on television. Just the little things that my grandma would teach me about how things were when she was growing up. And even when my mom was growing up, how different things kind of were then as opposed to where we are today.
"It's huge to hear the stories because you don't want to forget where we came from."
Hearing the stories, understanding the struggles his grandmother went through, makes Boykin realize how far the country has come. But he is also aware of how much further we still need to go.
"I think we're always going to be working towards being perfect, because there's no such thing as perfect," said Boykin. "Just seeing how far the needle has moved since then is definitely amazing."
Boykin knows he wouldn't be where he is today without the struggles those in his family endured, and that is what gives him the strength in everything he does.
"The same blood that runs in her veins, runs in mine," said Boykin. "She was so tough to be able to make it through all the stuff she did. I'm just as tough now because of her. I am proud of where my family has come from, where my family has been and where it is today. And I'm just trying to carry on that tradition."
Carrying that on means sharing his message with others, sharing his story, sharing inspiration with those who are coming after him and sharing advice for young kids today.
"I would say be proud of being Black first and foremost," said Boykin. "And then try to find ways to learn about your history. Whether it's through their mom or their grandmother on their grandfather. Be proud of the things the people before them did because they're very strong in order to be able to be here today."

Steelers to honor special operations as part of STS game
Steelers.com
The Steelers will honor active-duty service members and veterans on Sunday at Acrisure Stadium when they host the Baltimore Ravens as a part of the Steelers Salute to Service game. The Salute to Service game, an annual NFL initiative, honors our nation's service members, veterans, and their families.
There will be plenty of activities honoring the military, including some with Steelers ties.
The Steelers are working in conjunction with the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for multiple aspects of the Salute to Service initiatives.
"The Steelers are very much committed to the military and wanted to honor Special Operations," said Allie Weiskopf, the Director of Public Affairs for SOCOM. "The Steelers are dedicated to involving so much of the Special Ops, to honor them and really ensure that our service members could also go to the game and have a good experience. I would say the Steelers went above and beyond.
"And the Steelers are committed to honoring their employees, and their fans who have served or have someone who served, as well as a part of this game. That is special and unique.
"I'm an Army brat, so I've worked all over. I've obviously been in the Army for 20 years. It is very special here in Pittsburgh and we feel very welcome."
The collaboration will begin before fans enter the Acrisure Stadium, with SOCOM displays on Art Rooney Avenue. Among the items on hand will be a military helicopter. In addition, there will be an Army Robot Dog. There will also be special operations gear, which includes an MZRZ special operations tactical vehicle and Zodiak small boat.
The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps will have tents in which gear will be on display, as well as information on all of the branches available.
Among the game highlights will be a Para-Commando Parachute team that will jump into the stadium pregame, dropped by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, with Major Ashley Selfridge, who is from the Western Pa., area, delivering the game ball to General Bryan Fenton, a career Special Forces (Green Beret) Officer. General Fenton is the 13th Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command.
"We are happy to do this with the Steelers because we're just so grateful that the Steelers want to honor them and highlight service," said Weiskopf. "Of course, we think service is special. So, we're just glad we get to bring that concept into the living rooms of the millions of Americans that will be watching this game.
"It means a lot to do this for Special Operations. They have always been what we call the silent professionals. They're the elite of the elite. They're not often publicly recognized. It's really nice for them to get that opportunity."
The Steelers will take the field with active SOCOM members leading the way out of the tunnel, each carrying the flag of their respective branch. They will be led out by individuals carrying the American Flag and the POW Flag. The individuals will also be honored during the game on the Jumbotron.
The Color Guard will be a SOCOM Joint Forces unit, featuring the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard and Space Force.
Lt. Col. Chad M. Gontkovic, who hails from Johnstown, Pa., will perform the National Anthem. General Fenton and Command Sergeant Major Shane Shorter, United States Special Operations Command, will serve as the honorary co-captains for the coin toss.
The Terrible Towel unfurl will be led by SOCOM members, all of whom are guests of the team at the game.
There will be a flyover of two A-10 Warthogs from the A-10 Demo Team from Davis-Monthan AFB.
The U.S. Steel Salute to Heroes recipient is Retired United States Navy Seal James Hatch. Hatch was part of a Special Operations unit that was deployed to Afghanistan to bring back 16 fallen colleagues who were killed by a rocket-propelled grenade.
The Terrible Towel Twirl will be led by former Steelers offensive lineman Jon Kolb, who served in the United States Army, along with active SOCOM members.
'Renegade' will take on a new look on Sunday, with military highlights intertwined with the aid of SOCOM. There will be other aspects for the Salute to Service game, including all active duty and veterans who are Steelers or Acrisure Stadium staff being honored in game.
Punter Corliss Waitman welcomed a group from TAPS and Survivor Outreach Services to Acrisure Stadium for lunch on Friday and surprised them with banners to honor their fallen heroes that will hang outside of the stadium for today's game.
The community organization of the game is TAPS. TAPS is the national nonprofit organization providing compassionate care and comprehensive resources to all those grieving a death in the military or veteran community. Since 1994, TAPS has provided comfort and hope 24/7 through a national peer support network and connection to grief resources, all at no cost to surviving families and loved ones. TAPS provides a variety of programs to survivors nationally and worldwide.
The Neighborhood Ford Store is planning a donation drive for the VA Pittsburgh's Homeless Veterans program, which will take place during activation prior to the game. The donation site will be on Art Rooney Avenue next to the Official Truck of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
There will be a pregame presentation at the POW/MIA Chair. Local leaders will join military representatives for a solemn remembrance.
A Salute to Service video featuring messages from Steelers players and coaches will air during pregame.
Country music star and actor Charles Esten will perform a salute to Rocky Bleier's storied career from his service in the Army during the Vietnam War and his four-time Super Bowl Champion career at halftime. Through a non-profit veteran's organization, CreatiVets, his career was captured in a song called "The Names That You Don't Know (The Ballad of Rocky Bleier)" and will be performed live by Esten.
The American Red Cross will staff a holiday card signing station for deployed military members, veterans and their families. Fans can visit the display in the Fed Ex Great Hall from when gates open until the end of halftime.
In addition, there will be military shoutouts throughout the game on the jumbotron from local deployed service members and fans. 'I Salute' placards will be handed out to fans. Salute to Service banners and stencils will be on display throughout the stadium. Military charities will be set up on Art Rooney Avenue for fans to stop by pregame.

5 for Friday: Figuring out QB an important first step
Contributing Writer/Editor
Deciding what direction to take at quarterback will be the biggest decision the Steelers make this offseason.
That's no great, earth-shattering statement.
A quick look at the final eight teams standing in the NFL postseason shows that the game's biggest stars – young and old – at the position are largely the players still standing in the playoffs, at least in the AFC.
If you were putting together a list of the top quarterbacks in the NFL, Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, Baltimore's Lamar Jackson, Buffalo's Josh Allen and Houston's C.J. Stroud would have been at or near the top of that list – at least at the beginning of the season.
All but Stroud had outstanding seasons in 2024 or have been past MVPs or All-Pro. And Stroud was the 2023 NFL Offensive Player of the Year.
But they also weren't all selected early in the NFL Draft.
Mahomes was the 10th pick in the 2017 draft and was the second quarterback selected. Allen went seventh-overall in 2018, while Jackson was the 31st pick in that draft. They were the third and fifth quarterbacks taken in their respective drafts. Stroud was the second pick in the draft, but was the second quarterback selected.
So, there is some good fortune or good scouting – along with some luck – involved in acquiring a star quarterback.
For example, if the Ravens had known that Jackson was going to become what he has, they wouldn't have made him the second of their two first-round draft picks in 2018. They would have traded up with their 25th pick, which they used to select tight end Hayden Hurst, instead of trading back into the first round to take Jackson with the 31st pick.
But short of hitting the lottery in this year's draft, one in which early projections don't show as being particularly deep or talented at the quarterback position, what can the Steelers do moving into 2025 at the NFL's most important position?
Those are the discussions that began to take place at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex this week between team president Art Rooney II, head coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan.
"We don't have a quarterback under contract and so we've got some major discussions there," Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said earlier this week. "It was a really good experience with the three quarterbacks that were on our roster this year individually and collectively. We are certainly open to considering those guys, but there's a lot of work ahead of us.
"The major work, obviously, starts first and foremost just understanding what our options are, what the field looks like in terms of free agency, what the draft pool looks like and then beginning the process in terms of decision-making based on known variables, and so Omar and I have got half a day carved out here this week just to begin that component of the discussion."
Given what's available and when some of those decisions need to be made because of the timing of free agency and then the NFL Draft over a month after that, there's a likelihood the Steelers will decide to try to move forward with Russell Wilson, Justin Fields and Kyle Allen – or some combination of that group – in 2025.
Can that be good enough for the Steelers to compete? The Steelers' quarterbacks – mostly Wilson and Fields – combined to throw for 3,264 yards with 21 touchdown passes and six interceptions in 2024. They posted a combined passer rating of 94.8.
That wasn't bad, certainly when compared to the team's quarterback output the previous two seasons. It was good enough to win 10 games in 2024. But it wasn't good enough to win in the postseason.
But here's the thing, looking at the quarterbacks still standing in the NFC, you see Jared Goff in Detroit, Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia, Matthew Stafford with the Rams and Jayden Daniels in Washington.
They're all good players. But they're not at the level of Mahomes, Jackson and Allen in terms of being superstar players – though Daniels might be that in the future. But at least one of those quarterbacks not named Mahomes, Jackson or Allen will be in the Super Bowl.
What their teams have done to ensure that has been to build a strong group around them, particularly in the cases of Goff and Hurts.
If the Steelers can't get the next Stroud or Daniels, who is likely to win NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2025, the next best path to winning is to continue to build as strong a roster as possible regardless of what they do at quarterback.
• The average margin of victory for the NFL's Wild Card games last weekend was 15.1 points.
And though the Vikings ran 71 plays on Monday night, compared to 51 for the Rams, the winning teams in the first five playoff games ran an average of 68 plays compared to 49 for their opponents.
What was the difference for the Rams and how the Vikings flipped that script on them Monday night and still lost? Turnovers and sacks.
The Rams recorded nine sacks against the Vikings and forced two turnovers, including one that was returned for a touchdown. As a result, they won, 27–9.
Defense can still matter in the playoffs if you're making splash plays.
But can it matter in the AFC, which arguably has better quarterbacks?
In the first three games of the AFC playoffs, Houston outgained the Chargers, 429-261, running 70 plays compared to 54 for the Chargers. The Ravens outgained the Steelers, 464-280, running 72 plays compared to 45. And Buffalo outgained Denver, 471-224, running 72 plays compared to 42.
The Steelers and Broncos both failed to force a turnover. And while the Chargers forced three turnovers, they had four of their own.
The Steelers, Chargers and Broncos had three of the stingiest defenses in the NFL in the regular season. But they largely didn't do the things in the postseason that got them to the postseason because playing too much defense against star quarterbacks is not a great recipe for winning.
The one commonality that the Steelers, Chargers and Broncos shared is that while they all had good defenses, their offenses weren't quite as potent.
When coaches and players talk about complementary football, this is a good place to start. While having a good defense is a nice place to start, teams also need a good offense to succeed in today's NFL. The offense helps the defense from being forced to line up to stop the Lamar Jacksons and Josh Allens of the world for 70-plus plays by possessing the ball itself.
• Currently, the Steelers have eight picks in the 2025 NFL Draft, including the 21st pick in the first round and 52nd in the second round. They also have selections in the third, fourth and fifth (from the Rams) rounds, as well as three seventh-round picks.
The overall spot of some of those selections will be adjusted when the NFL announces its compensatory selections. The Steelers are not expected to receive any compensatory picks this year.
But the other thing they have are four draft picks from 2024 who are coming back after playing little to no football this season because of injuries, first-round pick Troy Fautanu, third-round selection Roman Wilson and sixth-round picks Logan Lee and Ryan Watts.
Getting Fautanu back next year will be a big boost to the offensive line and will be like having a second first-round draft pick. He was impressive as a rookie, including starting the team's Week 2 win at Denver, before suffering a season-ending knee injury in practice the following week.
"I feel like I haven't played football in years, just watching," Fautanu said this week. "I'm excited to attack the offseason. I've had my time off. I'm ready to go."
Wilson, like Fautanu, appeared in just one game in 2024, playing five snaps after missing most of training camp, returning and then getting injured again.
But his addition should be a boost to the wide receiver room.
And Watts and Lee could provide valuable depth if they can utilize what they learned from being around the team in 2024.
So, while the Steelers have eight picks in this year's draft, they in some ways have 12 considering four of their 2024 rookies didn't get the opportunity to play because of injuries.
• T.J. Watt aligned on the left side of the defensive line 94.7 percent of the time in 2024, much as he had in previous seasons with the exception of his rookie year, when he was on the right side of the line.
That has worked pretty well over the years.
But Watt was increasingly chipped and double-teamed in 2024, as opponents dedicated two or even three players to ensure he didn't wreck games. As a result, Watt finished the season with 11.5 sacks, his fewest in a full season since his rookie season.
Watt said this week he's open to moving around the defense more often next season.
"Teams are playing certain ways with chips and helps and stuff like that and getting the ball out quick and I need to be more open to moving around more and trying to affect games as much as possible," Watt said. "You guys know I want to affect the game more than anybody but I don't want to selfishly go to a different spot when I feel like I could have a better rush on the left side.
"I definitely feel like, schematically, it's been a tough year with how offenses have schemed things to try and get me out of the game. It's going to be a big breakdown for me to try and find ways to make plays."
It's what other teams do with their biggest pass-rush stars, as Myles Garrett, Max Crosby, Micah Parsons and others move around the line to keep offenses from determining their protection plan based on knowing where those star rushers will be.
It's understandable that the Steelers haven't done that as much with Watt. In Cam Heyward, Alex Highsmith and even backup Nick Herbig, they have premium pass rushers at multiple spots.
But to Watt's point, knowing where he will be on every given play – or most of them – allows opponents to develop a concrete blocking plan.

Moving Watt around more would be a change, but it wouldn't be a seismic one.
"I don't know that a lot of dramatic changes need to be made regarding T.J. Watt, to be quite honest with you," said Tomlin. "I think his resume and production speaks for itself. He's been ridiculously consistent over his stay here, and even in the midst of the 2024 season that didn't unfold in the way any of us would like. I've got a lot of things that have my attention before I start getting into T.J. Watt-like production in terms of my to-do list."
• That Watt's season is being looked at in some circles as a "disappointing" one just shows how high he has raised the bar.
Watt finished the season with 61 tackles, 11.5 sacks, a league-best six forced fumbles, 19 tackles for a loss, 27 quarterback hits and two fumble recoveries.
For most players, that would be a "career-year."
To put Watt's sack total into perspective, realize that the sack has been an official statistic in the NFL since 1982. That means there have been more than 40 seasons since the sack has become a league-recognized statistic.
Watt's 11.5 sack total from 2024 would have led the Steelers in 26 seasons since 1982. And just seven players in team history have officially had more sacks in a season than Watt's 2024 total.
Yes, Watt didn't have 22.5 sacks as he did when he tied the league record in 2021 or the 19 that he recorded in 2023.
But he made an impact on every single play on which he was on the field in 2024 simply because every opponent had to account for him on each of the 938 defensive snaps he took during the regular season.

Breaking barriers across the board
Steelers.com
In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today we look at the life, legacy and career of Lowell Perry.
Inside the library at the Steelers office at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, prominently located behind the six Super Bowl trophies the team has won, is a wall that is home to photos of the best of the best who have ever worn the black and gold. A total of 94 pictures adorn the wall, all of them with meaning.
The vast majority of the pictures are the same ones that hung on the wall in Art Rooney Sr.'s office at Three Rivers Stadium, with some added through the years.
The photos are a who's who in Steelers' history, names that roll off the tongue of Steelers fans with ease.
Joe Greene. Jack Lambert. Terry Bradshaw. Lynn Swann.
I could list others, but you get the point. The players were special and had a special place in Art Rooney Sr.'s heart.
One of those photos is of a player who Steelers fans not familiar with the early history of the team might not recognize, because his career wasn't a long one. However, his impact on Rooney, the Steelers, the NFL and the business world was.
Below a photo of Lambert, and above one of Bradshaw, is a picture of Lowell Perry. Perry was selected by the Steelers in the eighth round of the 1953 NFL Draft. Perry's arrival with the Steelers was delayed for three seasons due to ROTC duties.
In 1956 Perry was able to finally join the Steelers for a delayed rookie season. It was time to live out his dream of playing in the NFL, something he waited a long time for.
Sadly, though, his career would be cut short before it barely even began.
In the sixth game of his rookie campaign, one that was showing amazing signs of promise for a long and heralded career for the receiver and kick returner, it was abruptly cut short due to injury.
While it ended his playing career, it was the start of a lifetime of breaking racial barriers.
* * *
Lowell Perry was born in 1931 and grew up in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He followed in the footsteps of his father, attending the University of Michigan where he was a standout athlete and two-way player for the Wolverines football team.
Perry's college career led him to being named an All-American, only the second Black player to be named All-American at the school.
His dream, though, was to succeed in football beyond the college ranks.
That dream became reality when he was drafted by the Steelers, but sometimes dreams are slightly delayed. And that was the case for Perry. After he was drafted, Perry was called to serve his country through the ROTC and joined the United States Air Force, where he earned the rank of second lieutenant. While at the same time, he kept football in his heart, playing for the Bolling Air Force team.
The Steelers assured him they would wait for him, and the receiver was back with the team for the 1956 season for his delayed rookie year. But it was a season that wouldn't play out the way Perry had every imagined.
It started when he had to deal with racial injustice on a road trip to Jacksonville, Florida to play the Chicago Bears in an exhibition game. Black players were barred from taking part in a parade the city had arranged for the teams and had to stay at a separate hotel because of segregation. Art Rooney Sr. arrived later, and when he learned of the news, promised it would never happen to his players again, a promise Rooney kept.
Perry's son, New York Knicks General Manager Scott Perry, remembers hearing the story of the trip to Jacksonville, but is forever thankful for the support his dad, who passed away in 2001, received from the organization.
"There were just a handful of Black, minority players on teams in the NFL then," said Scott Perry. "He had a little bit of that dynamic to deal with, but he always just talked so much about how the Steelers organization handled things, how they treated their players and embraced everyone as equals. That really stood out to him."
What also would stand out, is how Rooney and the organization treated him during the most difficult time of his rookie year, a time that changed everything for him.
Perry started off with a bang when he ran for a 93-yard touchdown in a preseason game against the Detroit Lions on the first play of his career. And the regular season also started off strong for him, catching 14 passes for 334 yards and two touchdowns, including a 75-yard touchdown catch against the Cleveland Browns, in his first six games.
"It was a very tough game, like it is today," said Perry. "He talked to us about the hard work, the physicality that went into practices, two-a-days, getting prepared for game days like these guys do today. Just how mentally strong he had to be.
"He was a very humble person, so he was never overly braggadocious about his time playing. I did gather he was having a very, very good rookie season, catching passes and returning kicks and you know, on his way to becoming a really good player in the NFL."
Until it all came to a quick and disappointing end. Going against the New York Giants in the sixth game of his career, Perry was hit by Giants defensive tackle Rosey Grier and linebacker Bill Svoboda, resulting in a fractured pelvis and dislocated left hip.
It was a devastating injury for the young receiver, something that he was never able to come back from. But he had a support system that got him through it all – Art Rooney Sr. and his wife, Kathleen.
"I remember at a very young age him sharing what that really meant to him," said Perry. "He told me he was in the hospital for 13 weeks in traction. Obviously, surgery is a lot better today. Those were some tough long days. Hard days.
"He said Mr. Rooney and/or his wife either came by the hospital or called him every single day for those 13 weeks. Every day. I think that left an indelible mark on him. First of all, what kind of people they were. It meant so much to him. That was a major part of getting him through that trying time. You are a young athlete in the prime of your career and now that probably wasn't going to happen because of the nature of the injury.
"He shared that Mr. Rooney told him all along if you want to come back and try to play, or if you don't want to play, you will have a position with this organization and that meant a lot to my dad."
Perry's dream was to return to the playing field, but after losing the speed that made him so effective, he knew it wasn't going to be a reality.
Instead, he made history, becoming the NFL's first Black assistant coach when Rooney kept his promise and hired him as the receivers/ends coach in 1957 and then he went on to work as a scout in 1958.
While Perry relished the roles and was grateful for the opportunity, it wasn't where his path would eventually lead. Rooney had paid for his first year of law school at Duquesne University, and that led to him breaking more barriers.
"What the Rooneys did for him to get him onto the next chapter of his life was huge and meant so much to him," said Perry. "That was passed down to his kids and really stuck. That hit home for me. I keep a lot of those lessons in my life now.
"I can't tell you how emotional I get when I talk about it. You don't see that often. I didn't live in that era, but you don't see that type of commitment, support and help now. That is rare. He was blessed to have been there.
"My life wouldn't be the same, his life wouldn't be the same, if he hadn't been in Pittsburgh. If he were still here today, he would attribute a lot of his experience there in Pittsburgh to Art Rooney Sr. helping him with the opportunity to play and being there for him all the time. That was appreciated so much by him. I learned stories from a young age that I carry with me now."
Those stories he carries with him aren't ones that always came from his dad, because his dad didn't like to share the stories of his success. Instead, they came from others in the sports world, the business world, or just in his community in Michigan.
"As I got older and I would run into people in the community, or professionals in Detroit or around the country that knew my dad and respected him, the things he did, people who looked up to him," said Perry. "He wasn't someone at home who sang his praises. He was my dad, busy being a father to three kids and a husband.
"I knew about the things he did as a young kid coming up, but once I got into college and in the work world and people started sharing stories about how he helped them, inspired them, that I knew nothing about. I think that is when it really hit home. My dad was the singular most impactful person in my life. But just the impact he had outside of his own family. He had a far reach in terms of helping others, breaking some glass ceilings. I know he was proud of that. I am proud of that myself."
And there is plenty to be proud of.
Perry used the law school stepping-stone Rooney provided him to go on and earn his law degree from Detroit College of Law and began an illustrious career. He clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Frank Picard, served as a hearing officer and prosecuted unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board and served on the board of NFL Charities.
With a little bit of football still in his blood, Perry took a job as a color analyst for CBS Television in 1966, working with play-by-play announcer Joe Tucker to broadcast Steelers games. It was a ground-breaking move, as he because the first Black person to broadcast a game to a national television audience.
Perry returned back to Michigan following his broadcasting days, joining Chrysler as a labor relations lawyer and escalating to the point where in the early 1970s he became the first Black person to manage a U.S. automotive plant.
In 1975, President Gerald Ford tapped Perry to be the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. During Perry's swearing in, President Ford spoke glowingly about him in his comments:
"This is a very great moment in this Administration. It is my great privilege and pleasure to have selected for this very vital role a person that I have known a good many years, a person that I have admired for many, many years.
"He first came to my attention when I saw his prowess on the gridiron at the University of Michigan. He made it and I didn't. He was really good and played not only exceptionally well at Ann Arbor but very well for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
"I have known Lowell over a period of time since then. I have always looked at his career, both in Government and with private employment, as an example of what a person can do who has got ability and the desire and the dedication."
Perry eventually would return to Chrysler after serving in the role and go on to become the director of the Michigan Department of Labor from 1990-96.
Through it all, there were so many lessons Perry learned from his father, so many things he holds tight to his heart.
"I think the phrase he shared with me about paying it forward, always being available, willing to mentor and spend time helping others, help improve their lives, improve their situation," said Perry. "Whether that's just time spent educating or assisting, trying to help somebody with employment. There's a phrase that my dad said, and I quote this a lot. He would always say to me, 'You are going to make a living out of what you do, but you make a life out of what you give.' That is what you are going to be remembered for. That is what I carry with me today."
To this day, Perry is a fan of the Steelers, someone who even through his busy days with the New York Knicks always manages to carve out time to watch games. He has seen the team play in person at Heinz Field and on the road and has made the trip to Saint Vincent College for training camp.
It's special to him, part of his life, part of his DNA.
"I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, but from the day I can remember I saw black and gold at home," said Perry. "We always watched the Steelers any time we could get them on television there. That is who I watched. Still to this day. I wish my dad was alive to see Mike Tomlin who has been coaching this team for a long time. How proud he would be of someone like him and what he stands for and what he has brought to the team and organization over the last 15 years. (General Manager) Kevin Colbert and Mike have been so kind to me. I have come and watched them work, learned from them, and it's a good escape for me from what I do.
"Everywhere that I have worked, they know beyond a shadow of a doubt, as long as we aren't playing on Sunday, they know where I will be. People gauge my mood on Monday morning based on what happened on Sunday."
It's those times when he is watching his dad's former team play, or when he meets someone who knew him, or when absolutely nothing at all sparks thoughts of him, that Perry really how lucky he is to be the son of Lowell Perry.
"My dad has been gone since 2001, but there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about him," said Perry. "Something will happen that I will call upon some wisdom he imparted on me to help me make a good decision. He was always about being fair and doing the right thing. That is important to me too.
"Over time you realize how fortunate you are to have that role model in your home. I was blessed and fortunate enough I had that person in my father who was present and giving of his time, support and wisdom. I know I wouldn't be where I am today without him.
"I never wanted to disappoint my dad. The great thing about him, he never pushed me or my brother to be an athlete. His thing was if you are going to play, give it 110 percent. You can't half do it. That was the main thing. He also said education was a big thing. You can't plan on a life of being a professional athlete. Because his career was cut so short, he could provide that wisdom.
"He wanted me to do more than he did. I can't be him. I have to be myself. But I have a lot of him in me. The big thing for me as he looks down and is proud is I carry on that legacy of paying it forward to young people in terms of the time spent, the mentoring and knowledge shared, just trying to help everybody I come in contact with. As long as I am doing that, I am living that standard he taught me, I am happy."

Tomlin on Pat's stats, Reid's values, Spagnuolo
Steelers.com
Q. In reviewing the game in Baltimore during your news conference, you said, "I was really displeased with the two red zone touchdowns, for example, to the tight ends. It's just too late in the year to have guys running open like that." From the defense's perspective, how is that supposed to work – is there verbal communication as to who is supposed to cover whom, is it an automatic based on the defensive call and the offensive formation, or is it something else? A. It's kind of all of the above. At this juncture of the season, per call you should be able to execute that without any level of communication. We should just be drilled enough where that gets handled fluidly. You reinforce it with verbal and non-verbal or hand signal communication, but that's just a reinforcement as things unfold prior to the snap, whether they're created by motion or shifts or otherwise. And so, it's really all of the above, and that's why I expressed it as disappointment. We should be drilled enough where we could do it without communication, and then we reinforce that with verbal and non-verbal, depending on the opportunity. And so they have all the tools at their disposal to get those route combinations covered.
Q. It would seem to me that down in that part of the field, in that situation you can't cover it man-to-man, so you have to be zoning it, right? A. If you play top notch quarterbacks who have relationships with their eligibles, you're forced to play man. Zones lose in line-to-gain circumstances or in close quarters vs. cohesion, relationships, expertise. Like if you play zone against Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, it's like running routes on air for them. They're going to saw you up. And so you have to play man or relatable zones. And those require some adjustments, some communication, and that's the cat and mouse game that we play at this level. That's why I refer to it as chess, not checkers. Zones get you beat because of arm talent and relationships. Man-to-man requires a bunch of communication and coordination from defenders and the understanding that they operate as a collective.
Q. As of today, Pat Freiermuth has been targeted 62 times this season, and he has 53 catches for 524 yards, a 9.9 average, and 6 touchdowns. And in the 3 games George Pickens missed with his hamstring injury, Freiermuth caught 3 passes in each game. How would you characterize those numbers? A. Sometimes (numbers) are reflective of a lot of things. You can play games with numbers. Sometimes there's a real conversation there. The lack of George Pickens creates schematic adjustments and focus on Pat Freiermuth. Or sometimes in a small sample size we didn't convert enough third downs, and so we didn't play enough snaps. Thus, you could describe the run game as not gaining traction, or any individual within a collective of not getting enough opportunity. And really the issue is just number of snaps, because you didn't win enough possession downs. And so on a small sample size, you could play a lot of games with numbers. The reality is, he is a major component of what we do, a central figure in terms of controlling the middle of the field, particularly in weighty moments – red zone, possession-down play – and sometimes his numbers are altered by a variety or a myriad of variables. And most of them interrelated, because these are complex discussions.
Q. On the Russell Wilson run to the goal line in the game against the Ravens, would you rather he slid instead of going for the end zone in that situation? A. Based on the results? Yes. But the competitor in me and the competitor in him, we play and we play to win. I never want to take away the natural instincts of a man, and so I generally coach around it. We coach ball security and not competitiveness, or quelling competitiveness or judgment in weighty moments. I think the real answer there is in the fundamentals around ball security, and not whether or not he slid or went for the end zone.
Q. You just mentioned playing and playing to win. But are there instances when the winning play isn't necessarily the most aggressive? A. No doubt. There are rules and axioms of the game that we live by. You never reach the ball for the goal line or the line to gain, unless it's a fourth down, for example. But those are born out of people playing and playing to win and negative things happening over the years. You learn, and you build rules based on experience, some of those experiences are yours, and some of them the experience of others from which you learn. The bottom line is there's a natural aggressiveness associated with the pursuit of victory. I never want to quell that. I want to manage that, and manage it prudently. And so, based on my experience or things that we learned from, we come up with rules that kind of put somewhat of a governor on it, but at the end of the day, these guys are race horses and you want them to run. You want them playing and playing to win and making aggressive split second-decisions, and generally, I'm in support of that.
Q. It seems to me that Chiefs coach Andy Reid is a lock for a Gold Jacket when he decides to retire from football, and you went against him twice when he was in Philadelphia and 8 times since he went to Kansas City. In terms of preparing for and competing against his teams, has he changed from when he was the Eagles coach to now being the Chiefs coach? A. From a competitor's perspective, he's changed very little. I'm a Franklin Planner guy over the years. I'm an archivist in a lot of ways, and I can open up a Franklin Planner from 2002 and look at the NFC Championship Game, my NFC Championship Game notes. I was a secondary coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it is amazing some of the things that captured my attention 22 years ago are still capturing my attention regarding minimizing his strategy and schematic approach to business. We're talking about a generation later. Now he has Patrick Mahomes. Then he had Donovan McNabb. The names and faces change, but a lot of the things remain the same. The unique relationship between the quarterback and tight end for instance. In Philadelphia, you had a guy named Chad Lewis, who was a major component of what they did in the very same way that Travis Kelce is a major component of what they do in Kansas City. It's eerily similar, but I think that's reflective of the gold jacket that you mentioned, because he has a mode of operation that is tried and tested. It's plug-and-play. That experience, that division of labor, that approach to business has won him a lot of games over the years, and he's just plugging in new bodies and evolving with the trends of the game. But it's still very much his core values that he believes in.
Q. Back in 2017, what was your take on a Texas Tech QB named Patrick Mahomes during your prep for that year's NFL Draft? A. I remember specifically that Kevin Colbert was extremely high on him. You know, I was halfway paying attention, because we had Ben Roethlisberger kind of in his prime at that time, and so it was window shopping for me. I tended to focus my energy on other, more significant, or more immediate help. I remember specifically in that draft class, I was looking at the edge rushmen, because we got a guy by the name of T.J. Watt. But Kevin, I remember very specifically, he always did his due diligence, and he was sky high on Mahomes. And I just remember him specifically talking about his release points and the fact that he could throw the ball on the move and from a variety of angles and body positions. Kevin talked about his baseball background, the fact that his dad was a former MLB player. Kevin was on top of that one when he was extremely high on Pat Mahomes.
Q. In talking about Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow before your trip to Cincinnati a few weeks ago, you said it was important to have "enough defense" for him, not to run out of schematics come the fourth quarter. Does that also apply today for Mahomes? A. No question. Any of the elite quarterbacks who have continuity within their system of offense, where they know where all their pieces are, and they have an understanding of what they're trying to get done, and they have time experience on the job, you better have enough defense. You better not run out of defense. And so certainly he falls into that category.
Q. What would you list as Mahomes' most underrated quality? A. His general feel for the game. He can keep his eyes downfield and feel the rush, feel escape lanes, buy time. His ability to run parallel to the line of scrimmage at times, or release the ball just as he's scrambling to and beyond the line of scrimmage, his spatial relationship component, his feel for space, his feel for space in the pocket, whether it's the rush or where he is, all of that lends itself to the unique plays that he creates in those extended play moments.
Q. Tight end Travis Kelce is 35 years old and he leads the Chiefs in targets with 122, which is 33 more than the next highest-targeted receiver on that team. What makes him dangerous? A. His unselfishness. You mentioned him in regard to his targets, but this guy plays the game without the ball in his hands. He is so aware of what's going on around him. He is an absolute zone killer. And man-to-man, he can win. He can beat his man, he can utilize himself and his man in an effort to rub for others. He just plays a well-rounded game, and he's also a guy who has been in the system for a long time, and understands it inside and out and his role in it. It is displayed in the quality of his play, and beyond targets and catches, he impacts the game in a lot of ways.
Q. In recent weeks, your team has gone against Jim Schwartz with Cleveland, Vic Fangio with Philadelphia, and Dean Pees with Baltimore. Today it's Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who is the only coordinator in NFL history to win Super Bowls with two different teams. What is the personality of a Steve Spagnuolo defense? A. They're aggressive schematically. They're a pressure group. On first and second down they're seventh in the league in terms of the amount of pressure that they bring with five or more rushers. On third down or possession downs, they're No. 2 in the league in terms of the amount of pressure they bring. You couple those two scenarios together, and they are an elite, tip-top pressure group in terms of the amount of pressure that they bring. You couple that with another characteristic of Steve's defenses, which is that they're well-coordinated and good from a pre-snap disguise standpoint. That's what creates the havoc that has allowed him to win Super Bowls in multiple cities as you mentioned. The collective that we've gone through in recent weeks, that's a very experienced group. All of those guys have been in the league as long as I've been in the league. They're very good at what they do. It's no secret why they've been able to sustain, and that's why we've been in some challenging circumstances. But this time of year, those are the type of circumstances and stadiums that you want to be in. As the road gets narrow, you want to know that you're sharpening your sword. You know where you are, you're making the necessary adjustments, or you're winning in the ways that you need to win this time of year to prepare yourself for January football.

Steelers huddle up to bring holiday joy
Steelers.com
There was a special feeling that took over Acrisure Stadium on Tuesday night when the Steelers hosted their sixth annual Huddle for the Holidays to bring joy, love and hope to others.
Holiday magic and the giving spirit filled the air as everyone enjoyed the fun, festive, one-of-a-kind outreach that provides the simple pleasures in life, as well as some of the basic necessities for the holidays for kids and families from local organizations.
"Just to see the smiles is amazing," said defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi, the Steelers 2024 NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee. "The holiday cheer and what the Steelers do as an organization to bring these families and kids around is amazing. A lot of smiles, a lot of fun. I love it.
"We have an obligation to be a light for people. This is bigger than us."
Among the organizations taking part in the event this year were Amachi Pittsburgh, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Center for Life, Clairton Youth Development, Homeless Children's Education Fund, Homewood Children's Village, Hope for Tomorrow Inc., LaRosa Youth Club, Latino Community Center, MPACT and Robin's Home.
"Huddle for the Holidays means so much to an organization like ours," said Jim Barry, who runs the LaRosa Youth Club in McKeesport. "It allows a first-class experience. It provides opportunities for underserved kids, the youth, to take in the holiday season. This is an event the kids and staff look forward to each year. The youth get to meet a ton of positive role models such as players, coaches, Steelers staff and community volunteers.
"It's just a really cool experience for the kids. They take care of feeding them, activities, everything. There is a lot of stuff our kids don't get to experience. So, it's really neat to see and experience with them.
"It's so heartwarming, honestly. It's hard to explain. But the best way I can explain it is when you see kids experiencing joy, especially around the holidays and really feeling the holiday spirit, and how much they appreciate what they're receiving and what they're getting. It just makes you so happy to be a part of such a wonderful event."

A holiday wonderland welcomed the guests, and it was Steelers players and staff lending a hand at an array of different stations, interacting and spreading joy to all of the kids.
"It's awesome to be here with the kids," said linebacker Alex Highsmith. "There is nothing better than giving. It's always better to give than to receive.
"I remember growing up as a kid, getting toys on Christmas morning. There was no better feeling."
Huddle for the Holidays, which was started by former Steelers tight end Vance McDonald and Convoy of Hope, has grown through the years into an opportunity for the entire Steelers organization to give back during the holiday season.
"It's crazy that it's our sixth year," said Blayre Holmes-Davis, the Steelers senior director of community relations. "To see what this event not only means to the organization, but the players also look forward to it every year. Before the season even started, they were asking me if we were doing the huddle event again. It means a lot to know that not only does our community look forward to it, but our players look forward to it as well too.
"It's hard for me to put into words the impact that it's been able to make, and also just the time that our players are able to take out just to spend time with folks in the community who need support during the holiday season and let them know they are there for them. They see them as individuals and they're there to give back.
"And I love that it's not only our players who are able to volunteer, but our front office staff are able to be there as well. While we're not always able to be together at events, this one, which always hits toward the end of our regular season, is a great opportunity to do just that. This is what we're all about, getting together as a team and being of service.
"It's a really great time for us as an entire team to take a moment to prioritize our community and to just show them we're going to continue to show up on a regular basis."
The event is one that is all inclusive, with something for everyone, from kids to parents. Included in the event were winter coats sponsored by RSM, health and wellness items and guidance from UPMC and American Heart Association, and Giant Eagle gift cards for grocery needs.
"The holiday season is really important to us, and we love to celebrate, but we also recognize that this is not always a time of celebration," said Holmes-Davis. "There are still families out there that are struggling to put food on the table, to give their kids gifts and opportunities. It's an opportunity for us to give back and to support them."
There were activities such as art & crafts, a photo booth, letters to Santa, corn hole games, haircuts and even a pampering manicure.
"Just being able to give back to the community is special," said defensive back Beanie Bishop. "For those who might not be able to have Christmas on their own, this is special. I kind of know what it feels like to have to depend on other people and maybe not have stuff for Christmas. There were years where we didn't have as much as we would like, or get the gifts that we wanted, but we got what we needed, coats and things like that.
"For the kids to be able to see me and the other players and give them the hope that they could be here one day too."
There was hope, as guests were treated in a warm and welcoming manner.
"While we're all busy in the hustle and bustle of we've got a game this week, we've got to prep for this and that," said Holmes-Davis. "This helps us to just stop and recognize the impact that we're making. When we see that one kid that was looking forward to seeing Cam Heyward or T.J. Watt or Russell Wilson and they're able to see them face to face and spend some time with them, that can make their whole day, their whole entire year. And it really puts into perspective the bigger picture."
The desire to give back spread over to multiple players foundations as well, with Cameron Heyward's Heyward House providing hygiene kits once again and Christian Kuntz Kuntz4Ki6s Foundation partnering with Pittsburgh's Toys for Tykes for toy giveaways for the kids.
"Being able to help out and do this is everything, especially being from here and being able to give back in a community that I grew up in," said Kuntz. "It is special and important to me and my family. I know how big of a platform everyone in this locker room has and the Pittsburgh Steelers organization has. It's an honor to do it."
Russell Wilson's Why Not You Foundation provided warm outwear, including hats, gloves and scarves for all, something that comes in handy and necessary during the cold winter months.
"Being able to be a part of events like Huddle for the Holidays is incredible," said Janelle Hahn, executive director of Why Not You Foundation. "Pittsburgh has welcomed Russell and the Wilson family with huge open arms. We love that we can give back to Pittsburgh and to kids and families in need.
"This is an absolute fill your heart moment."
The organizations served during Huddle for the Holiday encompass an array of groups, but the one thing that ties them all together is a genuine need that exists today for a holiday lift.
"Something like this is spectacular because the people we serve don't normally get to do things like this," said Karen Triscas, a Navy Veteran and Certified Peer Specialist at Robin's Home, as well as a product of Robin's Home program. "For them to come to the Steelers stadium, that in itself is amazing. We serve a lot of homeless veterans. For them to come here is incredible. It's the experience. The residential house we have, the women and children that stay there, this is awe inspiring for them. This is something immaculate for them to experience. It's so important and so festive."
While seeing the players and getting toys, a warm coat and a hot meal was special, having the opportunity to visit with Santa might have topped that for some wide-eyed kids.
"Especially in the community my organization serves in McKeesport, a lot of our kids depend on events like this because a lot of our parents either don't have opportunities or aren't in a position to buy Christmas gifts," said Barry. "Getting a gift, and coats and gloves, is so impactful in their lives. Getting stuff like that is immeasurable how it can affect our kids' lives.
"It's a really special event. It means so much because it's not something that has to be done. Everyone's busy around the holidays. And these people take the time away from their families to really change the lives of under-served kids who really can benefit and really appreciate what they're getting.
"The kids were bouncing off the walls when we were loading up the bus to come here. It's a lot of fun, for a staff member as well because you share in that enjoyment that the kids are having and that they're awesome."

Steelers Nation Unite
A connection like no other
Steelers.com
Jim Zimmerman Sr. got a surprise of a lifetime when he was honored before the Steelers-Eagles game as the winner of the Steelers 2022 Fan of the Year for his love and passion for the team.
"I almost cried," said Zimmerman of getting news on the field before the game from linebacker T.J. Watt. "I never expected anything like this in my life. That was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me."
But his love and passion for the team is just the tip of the iceberg as to why he was selected as the winner this year.
Zimmerman is a man who bleeds black and gold.
He is Pittsburgh born and bred, and he loves all of his Pittsburgh sports teams, with the Steelers as close to his heart as anything in life is.
It's his passion, his joy, his way to find happiness.
On the flip side, one of his newest and closest friends, Bill Soloway loves his Philadelphia sports teams, and has a passion for the Eagles as he is a diehard fan who was born and raised in the Philadelphia area.
But despite his love for the Eagles, he is quick to admit his heart is with the Steelers.
And it's all because of Zimmerman.
* * *
About nine years ago, Soloway was given a diagnosis that changed his entire life. He was diagnosed with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that took the life of his brother and his mother, and now was threatening his own life after he suffered congestive heart failure.
The outlook was grim and Soloway was in a state of panic. As the primary care giver for his 85-year-old father, John, he didn't know what would happen if his life was cut short like others he loved.
Without many choices, Soloway met with doctors and experts at Gift of Life Donor Program in Philadelphia about the potential of a heart transplant. He knew the odds were stacked against him, but it was his only hope.
"So many people die every day waiting for a life-saving heart transplant," said Soloway. "I didn't want to be a statistic. It's pretty nerve wracking in some instances.
"My quality of life deteriorated to the point where I couldn't do things. I just kind of existed. I was limited in what I could do. Just to walk five steps was a major undertaking. It was like climbing a flight of steps to just going from one room to another and I would get winded. I thought what do I have to lose at this point? To get a heart transplant and possibly get a second chance at life was the only option."
In less than 90 days, in June 2015, Soloway got news that while was great for him, was heartbreaking for another family. Someone who was a donor had passed away, and he was getting their heart.
"It's surreal when you get the news," said Soloway.
After his surgery and recovery there was one thing left that Soloway wanted to do. He wanted to say thank you, tell the family of his donor what it meant to him to get the life-saving heart.
But it wasn't all that easy.
Donors have to write a letter, which is void of any personal details, to the donor family and it had to go through the Gift of Life Donor Program.
"There is a process of letter writing," said Soloway. "I said thank you for this amazing gift. Here is what I am able to do now thanks to this life saving gift. I couldn't put anything in there that would identify me.
"They send it and give the donor family the opportunity to open the letter or not. Some may read it immediately, some wait, some never. My letter was opened immediately, and they wrote back.
"This went on for several communications. It's a certain length of time, letters that have to be received. Then one of us has to say I am interested in meeting you and the other has to agree to sharing contact information. Then you sign a waiver, and the organization pulls out and you can communicate on your own."
A large percentage of people don't ever open the letter, and among those who do, the majority never meet.
In this case, though, things were different.
Soloway got to meet Jim Zimmerman, whose son James Zimmerman Jr. was the donor. James, a former Marine, was an organ donor at the time he unexpectedly died and Soloway was blessed to receive his heart.
The two talked on the phone, formed an immediate bond, and agreed to meet halfway between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia at an organ donation celebration in Hershey, Pa.
"Bill is a real good man," said Zimmerman. "I felt so blessed meeting him. It was tragic after my son passed away. I don't have much family. Bill reached out to me, he sent me a letter. We sent letters back and forth and didn't know who we were talking to. I was excited to meet him. It was exciting to go out there and meet him. I met him and his father. I feel so blessed I got to meet him. We got to know each other. We contact each other a lot. I call him, he calls me.
"I feel like he is family. He reminds me so much of my son. My son would do anything for anybody. Bill honors my son so much. He rides his bike in contests and he has my son's name on his bike and everything. He sends me pictures of the races and stuff. He is a really good guy. I would never expect to meet somebody like this. I never met a person like him before. He is so kindhearted. He reminds me so much of my son."
One thing they both spoke often of was their love of sports for their hometown teams, but it was when they met that Soloway saw how passionate Zimmerman was about the Steelers.
"When I first met Jim in Hershey, he had a Steelers shirt on," said Soloway. "Every time I would see Jim, he would have some kind of Steelers shirt on. I finally said to him, I do this thing with my father for spring training, and we go see the Phillies, would you like to go to a Pirates game? He said sure. I took him to a game, and he was wearing a Steelers shirt. I said I guess you are a big Steelers fan. He said yeah. I asked if he ever went to a game, and he said he never had the opportunity to. He told me his dad never took him to a game and he wanted to break the cycle and take his son James to a game, but it never happened. That dream never became a reality.
"I looked Jim in the eye and said James is going to take you to a Steelers game. He looked at me cockeyed. I told him I am going to take you to a Steelers game, with James' heart in me."
The two went to see the Steelers play the New England Patriots at Acrisure Stadium in the home opener this year, a dream come true for Zimmerman.
"It was something out of this world," said Zimmerman. "Just to be there with him, be in that stadium. It meant a lot to me. It was a very important part of my life to be there. It was so exciting. I always wanted to go to a Steelers game. My son and I talked about it a lot. We always wanted to go to one. We went to Pirates games a lot but always wanted to go to a Steelers game. I was so happy. I thought it was the only game I would ever go to. It was so exciting to go there."
As excited as Zimmerman was, Soloway was even happier to provide the experience of his first Steelers game.
"We were right down there near the field," said Soloway. "Jim was like a little kid. He had his Terrible Towel, his Steelers shirt and hat. I captured a moment of him waving the Terrible Towel. To see that picture, that captures the whole sports moment. He was rocketed back in time and the little kid and big sports fan in him. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. That picture is worth 10,000 words."
It was while the two were in Pittsburgh for the game that Soloway learned about the NFL Fan of the Year program, and it clicked. He nominated Zimmerman to be the Steelers Fan of the Year, and their story touched many hearts and Zimmerman was selected as the winner.
"What a dream come true to be able to recognize Jim as the Steelers Fan of the Year," said Soloway. "It's amazing. Here I am a diehard Philly sports fan, avid Eagles fan, and now I'm taking Jim to Pirates and Steelers games, and I am a Steelers fan at heart. Had it not been for James saying yes to organ donation, I wouldn't be here today. Every time I see Jim, I give him a big hug because then his son's heart is next to his heart when we do that."
Zimmerman learned that he won the honor when the Steelers hosted him and Soloway at Lincoln Financial Field to see the Steelers and Eagles meet. While Soloway was in on the surprise, Zimmerman had no idea what was in store.
"We talked about the fact that the Eagles and Steelers were playing. It's a rarity for both of our teams to play," said Soloway. "I explained to Jim that I talked about our story and the Steelers wanted to send us to the game. That is how I framed it up. That people were so moved they wanted to do something special for us.
"He was really excited. I asked if he was ever in Philly and the only time was when James died, because he died in the Philly area. He doesn't have good memories of the area. But there are things he wanted to do and see, including getting a Philly cheesesteak.
"He couldn't wait to see another game. He was like gosh, I have never been to a Steelers game and now I am going to two."
While they might have had their own favorite in the game, there was no doubt the black and gold ruled the day in their hearts.
"I brought some Terrible Towels for both of us," said Zimmerman. "I told him, you have my son's heart, and he was a Steelers fan. And he let me know he is a Steelers fan at heart."

Making a change in the community she cares for
Steelers.com
The Steelers have taken part in the NFL's social justice platform, Inspire Change, since it's inception, and for the third straight year the league is presenting an Inspire Change Changemaker Award, which recognizes an individual from every NFL city who is making a difference in their communities through social justice work, either individually or as part of a non-profit organization through education, economic advancement, police-community relations, and criminal justice reform.
The recipient of the Steelers Inspire Change Changemaker Award for 2024 is Carolina Frantz, MSN, RN and the Director of Diversity and Inclusion at Duquesne University's School of Nursing BSN-AID program.
Frantz, and the other 31 winners, will receive a $10,000 donation courtesy of the NFL Foundation for their charity. Frantz will also be honored at the Steelers Inspire Change game on Dec. 25.
Frantz learned of the news when she was surprised by outside linebacker Alex Highsmith, who does a lot of community who like Frantz, does work with the homeless population in Pittsburgh.
"I was beyond surprised," said Frantz. "It's super exciting. Honestly, this is stuff I do regularly. People do bigger things too.
"It's shocking I am being chosen to do this because it's just everyday things I like to do and want to do."
Through her volunteer efforts, she has supplied more than 14,000 pairs of socks to the homeless since 2023, working closely with organizations such as Pittsburgh Mercy, Jubilee Kitchen, and Shepherd's Heart Fellowship and Veteran's Home.
"I've always wanted to give back to people," said Frantz. "I'm a people person. I became a nurse because I am a people person. It's fulfilling for me to help other people. That is it. Just be a good person."
She utilizes the garage in her Beaver Falls, Pa., home to organize and manage all of the donations, which the majority come from the clothing company Bombas, making a difference for countless people, as socks are one of the most requested items in shelters nationwide.
"It's really special," said Blayre Holmes-Davis, the Steelers senior director of community relations. "There's a lot of great people in our community who do this work as part of their job. And it's a great opportunity.
"But I think to honor someone who just takes time out of their day to make sure that homeless people have access to socks, food and all the other things that she's been able to do to help streamline a lot of the services for organizations in Pittsburgh that are providing services to our most vulnerable is really important. Especially, she has all of these socks at her home. I think not only being able to work with community organizations to say, how can we streamline this, but how can we distribute 14,000 pairs of socks in our community. Then also to have space in your garage to make sure that you're able to house that.
"It's a great opportunity when we're able to honor people who are CEOs and in charge of different organizations and nonprofits. But it's also really important to make sure that we highlight community members that are taking time out of their day. They don't have to do it. They just do it to give back. They see a need in the community and don't look anywhere else, but say how can I help meet that need. We're really excited to honor her and just to let her know that we see her work and we support her fully."

Steelers give back through Social Justice Fund
Steelers.com
The Steelers are continuing their mission of making a difference in the Pittsburgh community and beyond through the team's Social Justice Fund Initiative.
This year the team made a total of $516,000 in donations, with the players contributing $258,000 and the team matching the donation to the Social Justice Fund Initiative.
"I want to say thank you again to our Social Justice Committee members for continuing to lead these efforts, which benefit so many great causes," said Steelers President Art Rooney II. "Our players and the organization have come together to provide the community with over $500,000 to support our neighbors in need of food, education opportunities, and many other vital resources."
Since its inception in 2018, the team and its players have donated a total of $2,994,970 combined.
"It's not one or two guys, it's a group of men that understand the importance of our community. I am thankful for that," said defensive tackle Cameron Heyward. "Guys have different things that they care about. We understand there are going to be a lot of people we want to affect, but it's good to see the City of Pittsburgh prosper from that."
A total of 37 players contributed to the Social Justice Fund Initiative this year, including a $100,000 donation from Cameron Heyward and a $50,000 donation from quarterback Russell Wilson. In addition, linebacker Elandon Roberts, tight end Pat Freiermuth, defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi and punter Corliss Waitman also made contributions of $10,000 or more.
"It's really cool to be a part of this organization and all the amazing things the players have done before us and what this organization has done over the years," said Wilson. "The Rooney family and Coach (Mike) Tomlin and all the greats before us, I think that they really set the standard of community going. I think it starts all the way back to Latrobe and the history of winning. Winning is a habit. And I think giving is too. And these guys, we all have a giving spirit. We give our all to this game, but we also want to be able to give our all to the community.
"I'm just so grateful just to be a part of such high character guys daily and their focus on others. That's what life is about. When much is given, much is required, it says in the Bible. I think it's such a blessing that we can give back, and not just our resources, but also our time. I think guys do a really good job of giving their time, which is probably the most valuable asset of them all."
This year contributions were made to 30 organizations in Pittsburgh, and in several players' hometowns, that are focused on youth development, food access, criminal justice, community and police relations, equity and inclusion education, and housing.
"It means a lot to me, especially this year being on the social justice committee and everything, getting a little more in depth to know what goes on in the community and how we play a part in it," said receiver Calvin Austin II. "Coach Tomlin always motivates us to not only show our character on the field, but off the field as well. I like to help in Memphis where I am from, but being able to help in the new city I am able to call home is something that's near and dear to my heart.
"I'm glad I've been able to just get out and interact with the community and meet new people and just see all the good that is actually happening in this community."
Since 2018, contributions from Steelers players, along with the matching donations from Steelers Charities, have benefited 82 charitable organizations throughout the region.

A night to celebrate the female fanbase
Steelers.com
The Steelers female fanbase is stronger than ever, and that was on display Wednesday night at Acrisure Stadium when the team hosted the first-ever SteelHERS Social, presented by UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital.
The event is part of the team's Women of Steel platform, which was created to celebrate, connect, develop and empower the team's female fanbase.
"This sounded like such a fun time to be out with your girlfriends, thinking about the season, getting ready for the fall," said Kristen Hudak, from Johnstown, Pa. "It's fun to be a part of something special. There is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement.
"I have been a fan as long as I can remember, as a little kid. You are born into it in this part of the country. It's always been part of my life."
Almost 1,000 women of all ages, even the tiniest of fans, from the Pittsburgh area and all over the country took part in a night filled with fun and friendship.
"I was very excited when I saw this event come out," said Lisa Perry, from Pittsburgh, Pa. "My son is a huge Steelers fan, and I am always excited about the games, but I don't know a lot about football. I wanted to come and get the experience to make sure this season I am ready to go. I am here to learn about football and be around women who are so passionate about the game. I want to get the energy of the other women and try to create some camaraderie with them.
"This is amazing. I walked in here with awe. It's very exciting. There are women here who are so passionate about the Steelers. I am just soaking it all in."
And yes, there was plenty of black and gold attire everywhere you looked.
The FedEx Great Hall served as the main point for activities, which included a Black & Gold bouquet bar, a paint & sip stadium, and tailgate-like attractions.
Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu and his wife, Theodora, took part in a fun and lively Q & A, which brought smiles and laughs to the couple and the attendees as well.
"What is nice is it's the evolution of the game in the sense that they're not players anymore, they're human beings," said Polamalu about part of the female fanbase's connection of the game. "You get to see their stories. The women are able to connect to the stories. What connects me with this is to see my wonderful wife and how she has been the backbone of my life, career and success. It's terrible sometimes because people say this is our life. In reality this is four percent of our life and the other 96% my wife is the star always doing everything. It's really cool I am able to celebrate my wife, show people the truth behind how things work in our family."
The current players conducted offensive and defensive drills on-field, coaching the ladies, encouraging them, and truly having a good time. There were also flag football drills as the Steelers have hopped on board full force with helping to grow the sport.
"I wanted to do this to celebrate our women fans," said receiver Calvin Austin III. "To be able to celebrate, talk with them, and have a day that is special for them means a lot. I went on the Steelers cruise, and nothing doubts me about this fanbase. They know all the details. They show us so much love and support."
The players also interacted with the guests in the Great Hall, playing games of cornhole and other fun games, and of course, posing for pictures to the delight of all.
"It's unbelievable to see what our community has put together here," said long snapper Christian Kuntz. "I have been a part of girl's high school flag football as well. This is great. This is special. It's an unbelievable turnout.
"And you know I am big on cornhole in the locker room, so I had to challenge some of the women out here today."
The ladies all had the opportunity to win an array of prizes, including one lucky winner leaving with a painting of Polamalu that was done live during the event.
"This is real big," said linebacker Elandon Roberts. "It's not just a male fanbase. You want to show the women we appreciate you. There are a lot of things in this sport women are a part of, with women's flag football really coming along too. I am also a pilar of getting out in the community, put my jersey on and put a face to it. I have fun at these types of events.
"One thing about this fanbase, the men and women are on the same page. I went to a restaurant here and there were two women sitting at the bar and they were going back and forth about football. I was amazed. But just being around the community, it's a blue-collar city and the fanbase is strong and emotionally embedded in our organization."

Top 2024 Moments: Watt closes out the Giants
Steelers.com
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is another in a series of articles looking back ay some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
The New York Giants made a mistake and T.J. Watt made them pay.
"He was supposed to be chipped," head coach Brian Daboll lamented after Watt sacked quarterback Daniel Jones, stripped the football and recovered it with 2:59 left in regulation on Oct. 28 at Acrisure Stadium.
Jones, likewise, acknowledged the gaffe, his failure to shift tight end Theo Johnson from the left side of the offensive formation to the right side pre-snap.
"Needed to shift Theo," Jones assessed. "I didn't shift him. (Right offensive tackle) Jermaine (Eluemunor) was expecting a chip and he didn't get one, so that's my fault."
The Giants, trailing 26-18, had recovered a fumble by Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson with 4:34 left in regulation. They registered one first down before the potential game-tying drive bogged down, thanks largely to consecutive plays made by Watt.
On second-and-8 from the Steelers' 20-yard line, Jones dripped back to pass and then scrambled to his right.
He had running back Devin Singletary in front of him as a blocker and plenty of green grass beyond Singletary, but Watt pursued from behind and made a diving tackle that limited Jones to a 1-yard gain.
"T.J. Watt reaching for the feet of Daniel Jones just saved a big play," ESPN play-by-play announcer Joe Buck reported.
Added color analyst Troy Aikman: "You see T.J. Watt, he gets up the field but he never loses sight of where Daniel Jones is. A lot of guys will rush up the field and then they're just totally out of the picture. Not T.J. Watt. He circles back and is able to make a play on a very athletic quarterback."
On third-and-7, Watt donned his Superman cape on the way to his sack, strip and fumble recovery.
Eluemunor, speaking about a potential matchup with Watt in advance of the game, had said he wanted to be "on an island with him all day."
Watt's fellow outside linebacker Alex Highsmith knew that was a bad idea, particularly in this instance.
"I knew the play, I saw the tight end over with me," Highsmith explained. "I saw (Watt) 1-on-1 with (Eluemunor), he's about to make a play. And he did, he got the ball.
"That's just what he does. That's why he's the best in the world."
The sequence was as good an example as any as to why Watt is one of five finalists for the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award.
The sack was Watt's second of the night on a Monday Night Football performance that also included seven total tackles, two tackles for a loss, two quarterback hits, the forced fumble and the fumble recovery that went a long way toward sealing a 26-18 victory for the Steelers.
But in the immediate aftermath he neither gloated nor took individual credit for plays he insisted were made by the defense as a collective.
"I mean, l have a lot of respect for every single player in the NFL," Watt maintained. "Everybody works hard, and I'm just trying to get my opportunities when I get 'em and make the most of 'em when they happen. But it's not possible without scheme.
"We've done a good job schematically of trying to create those 1-on-1s along with the backend covering just long enough and the guys up front also chewing up blockers. So it's a team effort."

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 13
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
HOWARD BURG FROM FLUSHING, NY: How can Jared Allen get elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame? L.C. Greenwood is left out in the cold again, and he was 20-times better than Jared Allen. ANSWER: Regular readers of this feature know that I'm a proponent of L.C. Greenwood being elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, because in simple terms he was the second-best player on one of the iconic defensive lines in NFL History, and all of those other iconic defensive lines have had more than one of its members elected. But that has nothing to do with Jared Allen's worthiness. I offer now something written by Jeremy Bergman of NFL.com about Allen after the Class of 2025 was announced:
"A four-time first-team All-Pro and five-time Pro Bowl pass rusher, Allen has parlayed a 12-year career filled with sack (celebrations) and eccentric hairdos into a gold jacket. The defensive end secured the honor in his fifth year of eligibility and as a finalist. Allen started his career in Kansas City … After an NFL-best 15.5-sack, 19-TFL season earned him an All-Pro nod in 2007, Allen was traded to the Vikings for a haul and then extended with what was at the time the richest contract for a defensive player. He more than lived up to the deal. Allen racked up at least 11 sacks in each of his six seasons in Minnesota and finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting in 2011 after tallying 22 sacks, still the second most in NFL history behind Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt's 22.5. After finishing his career in Chicago and Carolina -- coming up just short of a Super Bowl title -- Allen enters the Hall with 136 career sacks (12th all time) in 187 games played. Though he came up short of the single-season sack mark, Allen does have the distinction of being tied for the most safeties in NFL history (4), a quirky milestone for one of the 21st century's most outlandish characters."
And one other detail worth noting: Allen was voted into the Hall of Fame as a Modern-Era candidate, while Greenwood now is eligible for election only as a Seniors Candidate, and it's "easier" to get the necessary votes as a Modern-Era candidate.
KEN WAMSLEY FROM BIDWELL, OH: Do you think the Steelers will draft a wide receiver with their first-round pick? And will Najee Harris be back next season? ANSWER: During this offseason, I believe wide receiver is an area the Steelers need to address this offseason, and address it in a way that adds some top of the depth chart type talent. But in my opinion, defensive line is another area that needs the same kind of attention/addition. The question then becomes how the team decides to approach those two areas of "need." The way it typically works during the NFL Draft is that a premium – beyond the quarterback position – is placed on the big guys. Hall of Fame General Manager George Young used to call that "The Planet Theory," in that there are only so many men on the planet who have the required skills to go along with the size to make them difference-makers on either side of an NFL line of scrimmage. As for Najee Harris' potential return, I don't know whether he might want to see what his services command on the open market, and what those numbers might be. That's not possible for me to predict, and if it's to come down to a guess, yours is as good as mine.
MARK DiGIOVANNA FROM LIBERTY HILL, CA: Were you a fan of the new kickoff changes this year? ( I was not.) Do you believe there is any chance the league will go back to the previous format after reviewing things this offseason? ANSWER: Let me put it to you this way: I understand why the league made the changes to what's referred to as the "dynamic kickoff," and since the NFL reported a drop in the number of concussions over the course of the whole season, I don't foresee the rules going back to the way they were. Add in the fact there were 7 kickoffs returned for touchdowns last season, and my guess is that outside of the potential for minor tweaks, kickoffs are not going back to the previous format.
NORM BRENNAN FROM CHACHAGUI, COLOMBIA: It's a small sample size, but I like what I've seen of Spencer Anderson at guard and as an overall player. What are your thoughts on his play? Development? ANSWER: Spencer Anderson is still a young (he'll turn 25 in June), developing player who has versatility going for him. As a third-year pro, Anderson has two more seasons on the contract he signed as a seventh-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and that aforementioned versatility gives him a chance to become the kind of player who earns a second NFL contract.
NATHAN COOPER FROM HANOVER, PA: I know that Art Rooney II said that signing a quarterback would be a priority this offseason. But when should we see that signing? ANSWER: The best case scenario for the team, I believe, would be to have identified and signed the better of the Russell Wilson-Justin Fields options, because having that settled sets up the rest of the offseason in terms of allocating cap space and draft capital toward dealing with the other roster issues that need to be addressed.
LORI STULMANIS FROM FEASTERVILLE, PA: If the Steelers don't re-sign Justin Fields or Russell Wilson, do you think they would consider Sam Darnold? Do you still think he'd be a good fit in Pittsburgh? ANSWER: I explained in the above question what I saw as the best case scenario for the team, and if that doesn't work out and the Steelers go into free agency with nobody signed for the top of the depth chart at quarterback, my opinion is there wouldn't be much that would be OFF the table in terms of addressing that situation.
DAVID POLLARD FROM WARRINGTON, UK: I recently came across a podcast about Doug Williams, referring to him as the first black quarterback to play in the Super Bowl. It made me think of Joe Gilliam, and I wondered if he took any snaps in Super Bowls IX and X? ANSWER: According to the NFL Game Summaries for Super Bowls IX and X, Joe Gilliam did not play in either of those games.
LARRY HALL FROM AUSTIN, TX: Although it's very unlikely the team would be able to bring back both Justin Fields and Russell Wilson, but if they both saw it as a legitimate opportunity to revive their careers – Russell a la Kurt Warner and Justin a la Baker Mayfield – would you be in favor of bringing each of them back on a 2-year deal? ANSWER: Art Rooney II said back in January that in his view both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields see themselves as NFL starting quarterbacks, and so bringing them both back isn't going to happen because they both can't be starters if they're on the same team.
LEE JOHNSON FROM MIDLAND, VA: When is Ben eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame? ANSWER: Ben Roethlisberger will be eligible to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2027.
MARC ROSZLER FROM TUCSON, AZ: Does the salary cap include just players and coaches, or does it include the entirety of the organization including support staff? ANSWER: Only players are covered by the rules of the salary cap. Everyone else is in addition to that.

Women of Steel: Always showing their support
The Steelers have introduced a new initiative this year highlighting the 'Women of Steel,' focusing on the women who make Steelers Nation strong.
Throughout the year we will be highlighting various factions of 'Women of Steel,' including female season ticket holders, community leaders, women in football, business leaders and more.
In this segment we are highlighting female season ticket holders, women who have a deep love of football and all things black and gold.
* * *
You don't have to be born in Pittsburgh to be a Steelers fan.
You don't have to even have grown up rooting for the black and gold to be a Steelers fan.
You just have to experience it once, to truly fall in love.
And that is exactly what happened to suite holder Kelly Gray.
"I moved to Pittsburgh from Memphis about 10 years ago and immediately became a Steelers fan," said Gray, who currently lives in Sewickley, Pa. "Being a lifelong sports fan, I was so excited to be in such an amazing sports town. I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama and went to the University of Alabama and college football was always a part of my life, from the very beginning. My dad and I spent many Saturdays watching football. It was a big part of my family. It was part of my DNA from the beginning.
"And the Steelers have a lot of similarities with the University of Alabama. The rich tradition. The history of winning the championships, the Super Bowls, and just the cast of characters that have played. That's what drew me initially, a familiarity that I recognized with the Steelers from my college team."
While that drew her to becoming a Steelers fan, what sealed the deal was stepping foot into Heinz Field on game day.
Once that happened, it was all over.
"I worked at FedEx, that is why I moved to Pittsburgh," said Gray. "Through the sponsorship of the FedEx Great Hall, they have a suite and we used it strictly for employees. Every home game there was a rotation of different functions that FedEx Ground hosted in the suite. I became quite accustomed to hosting the suite there with teammates through my department and human resources.
"I have been to many college games, all around the South, the SEC, but there is nothing like being in Heinz Field with the Terrible Towels going and Renegade playing and that whole feeling of oneness of the fan support. It's just fantastic. It's one of the best things in sports in my opinion."
Such a great feeling that after Gray retired from FedEx, she didn't want the experience of going to the games to end. So, she is now a proud suite holder, enjoying games with family and friends.
"During the pandemic I was sitting around wondering what it would be like to have your own suite," said Gray. "I started making phone calls and inquires and just did it.
"I absolutely love it. The ease of getting in and out of the stadium. The parking. It's nice to have friends enjoy it with you. You don't always have the opportunity to visit and share with them in stadium seats. It's one more way to enjoy it with friends. Since I have been a season ticket holder it's been a weird ride because of the pandemic. One of our first games there was basically nobody in the stadium except for friends and family. That was a surreal memory. You could hear everything on the field, calling the plays, talking to each other, the refs. It was really strange. You never get that in a game.
"I love Steelers football."
Gray became immersed in the history of the Steelers once she was exposed to the team. She caught up on all the time she missed not growing up in Pittsburgh and now her knowledge of the Steelers matches her overall football knowledge.
"I have been a devout fan my whole life," said Gray. "My dad was an expert from watching the games, hanging on every word that was said. I do the same, not to an extreme. I always want to be current. It's something I enjoy keeping up with. I gravitate toward it because it's my interest. I want to be in the know.
"I am a serious football watcher. I love the competition. I want to see good football. I want to see excellent MVP level play. I like seeing good teams play and want ours to be the best. I love the amazing plays, last minute drives, comebacks.
"Coming from Alabama, I am used to being around a strong fan base, but it is really endearing to have so many female Steelers fans you can talk to about the team in depth. You can talk about the draft, the roster, the players, the coaches. I love talking to the women, and the guys, who are surprised that I really know football.
"And the Steelers are special. The rich tradition of the Rooney family is so special. The caliber of the organization. All of that comes across when you see them in action. I love the pride of the organization, the fans. And walking through the Great Hall and seeing everything."
The 2022 football season is one Megan Zillweger-Jones will always hold close to her heart.
Because it will be her first seasons as a Steelers season ticket holder.
Zillweger-Jones put her name on the season ticket waiting list in 2002, and to her surprise, she received an email that told her tickets were available.
She jumped at the opportunity.
"I was honestly shocked because it's been I so long I didn't even expect it anymore," said Zillweger-Jones, who lives in Saxonburg, Pa. "My sister and her husband got their tickets last year. And until that point, I thought that the whole stadium was all seat licenses, and it would never happen. I thought I would be dead before my name came off the list.
"But, we got the email and my husband saw it first. He said to me, what do you think about the seats, did you see where they are? I'm like, what are you talking about? We got the season tickets. I thought he was kidding because he texted me and I hadn't seen the email yet."
Once she saw the email, though, she knew it wasn't a joke and was absolutely thrilled.
"I was like, get out of here," said Zillweger-Jones. "We've been getting tickets through his college roommate. We've been buying tickets from him for the last couple of years. We've been able to go to some games but now to have our own seats and I'm so excited.
"I didn't realize, but evidently this was the second time that we've been given an offer and I didn't know that. I don't know how I missed the first one. I completely panicked because it said this is your second offer and if you don't accept it, you go to the bottom of the waitlist. I was panicking because I did not see the first email. I talked to the people in the ticket office and they were so helpful. I was thinking this is not happening. I finally get the chance to get tickets and I messed up and am going to get put to the bottom of the waitlist.
"But it all worked out. My niece is going to Pitt in the fall so my sister and her husband have seats. I'm excited that we'll be able to go to the games with family. I'm excited, and so are my kids, for what the future is."
Zillweger-Jones grew up cheering for the Steelers, something that started with her father and just grew throughout the years. It was that passion that was instilled in her which had her sign up for the season ticket waiting list, and the dream came true.
"I've always been a Steelers fan," said Zillweger-Jones. "I grew up a Steelers fan thanks to my dad. His whole mood for the week depended on if the Steelers won on Sunday. Watching Steelers games was something we did as a family. My sister and I both loved watching the games and we both got on the list around the same time. She and her husband got their seats last year. We're getting our seats this year. So, I'm excited. That's something to continue with our families and her kids love football and my kids love it. It's a great family thing."
Zillweger-Jones love of the Steelers dates back to the 1970s, and the one thing she truly appreciates is the consistency within the organization.
"We'd go over to my uncle's house on Sunday and my cousins would be there and my dad and my uncle," she recalled. "I remember watching the games with everybody when I was little. If we weren't home, they were on the radio.
"What I love is things are similar now to how they were then. I love integrity. I love the Rooney family has been the ownership from the beginning. They have always had integrity and loyalty with this team. I love that the team always seems to stay together. They seem to be a team more than individual players that are only there for themselves."
And they are a team that she is still pinching herself that she is going to be able to watch in person all season … in her own seats.
"I don't know how long it'll take to set in that like these are our seats," said Zillweger-Jones. "I don't know. I just know I'm excited."
When Renee Minnemeyer-Climo joined the Steelers season ticket waiting list in 1995, she was told it would likely be 20 years until her name would come off the list and she would have the opportunity to purchase tickets.
The timing was dead on.
In 2015, Minnemeyer-Climo got an email from the Steelers ticket office, and her dream came true.
"It was crazy," said Minnemeyer-Climo, who is from Beaver Falls, Pa. "They said when we got on the list it was about a 20 year wait, and it was literally a 20 year wait. We got married, got on the list, and it was a great 20th anniversary gift.
"I got an email about it and the first thing I did was call my husband. Then they said you had to have your decision fast. I didn't wait. I took care of it the first day. It was so exciting."
Going to Steelers games was nothing new for her, as she purchased tickets from a friend who was a season ticket holder back when the team played at Three Rivers Stadium. But when they made the move to Heinz Field, the friend no longer had access to the tickets, so it was tougher, making getting her own season tickets a joy.
"It's the best thing," said Minnemeyer-Climo. "The best.
"I love going to the games. I scream so loud I have no voice the next day. There is nothing like being in the crowd, a night game with the Terrible Towels going and everyone seeing it on television. Football has the most impact from a fan. You can yell so loud and cause an offside, false start. You don't' get that in other sports. It's the best fan sport to be a part of."
The past two years have been tough for her though, unable to go to games because of the Covid pandemic. She is a leukemia survivor, unable to enjoy one of her favorite pastimes because of health concerns. But she is hoping that is all going to change this season.
"I am hoping it's going to work out because I really want to get back into the action," she said. "I've missed it. I plan everything around games. We don't go on vacation during football season. I had a trip cancelled during Covid to Australia and it's happening during football season now. I already have anxiety.
"We have only one person who can come over to our house for games because they know the rule about not talking. I am very superstitious. I have to wear the same thing. It doesn't get washed until they lose, because you know I control the outcome."
Like many, her love of football came from her family, and in her case, it was her late mother who instilled her passion for the black and gold.
"Most people think your love of football comes from your dad. For me it was my mom," said Minnemeyer-Climo. "She was a Steelers fanatic. When I was a little girl, we watched the game. I have the same rule as she did. You don't talk during a Steelers game. Anything I wanted to learn about the Steelers I had to find out during a commercial break because you couldn't talk during a game.
"Back then you were able to go to the Pittsburgh airport and greet the players when they came back from a game. We did that. I got to meet the likes of Terry Bradshaw and Rocky Bleier and my favorite Jack Lambert. We got our picture with him. It was fun because I learned the game and we got to interact with the players."
One of her dreams was to see the Steelers play in the Super Bowl, and enjoy it with her mom to celebrate their love of the game together.
"We went to Super Bowl XL and my mom couldn't go, but said she would go to the next one with us," said Minnemeyer-Climo. "She got cancer and died within a year. Super Bowl XLIII came, and she left an envelope for us to go to the game. We went on her. We were at the game, the best Super Bowl ever. I turned to my husband at the end of the game, and I said I can't believe my mom isn't here with us, she would have loved it. At that point he pulled out his wallet and had a picture of my mom in it and said she is here with us. That was such a memory. I can't believe he did that. It's my favorite football memory. I feel like she was there, and she wasn't going to let me leave without the team winning."
Her experiences going to games, watching on television, have brought her joy and pride, as she knows the Steelers way is a tradition like no other.
"I love the tradition," she said. "I love that we are a respected team that has been around a long time. We don't follow fads. We have a respect for the players that goes beyond other organizations. Even when players leave or come here, they say it's different here. I feel that as a fan too. We have stability. We have longevity and respect for the coaches and fans.
"And our fans are special. What is cool about our female fan base is we are educated football fans. We know the game. We are able to communicate in an educated manner with other people. I feel that not all female fans are in it for the game, and we really get it."

The final day of the NFL Scouting Combine put the offensive linemen on center stage at Lucas Oil Stadium and it was worth the wait.
"It's a deep group of starters," NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah assessed of the class available for selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. "Maybe not those elite payers like we had last year but there are a lot of guys that are ready to plug in and play, and a lot of guys with versatility that have some experience playing different positions."
Jeremiah highlighted four such players as examples of what this year's offensive line class has to offer.
Alabama's Tyler Booker, in Jeremiah's estimation, is "plug-and-play" at guard.
Missouri's Armand Membou has experience at guard and offensive tackle.
North Dakota State's Grey Zabel is capable, Jeremiah maintained, of playing all five offensive line positions.
And Ohio State's Donovan Jackson moved from left guard to left tackle after a season-ending injury sustained by Josh Simmons and helped lead the Buckeyes to the national championship.
And there are more where they came from.
"Talent and versatility, that's what screams at you from this group of players," Jeremiah summarized.
Following is a look at some of the highlights of the NFL Network's coverage of Day Four in Indianapolis:
NOT HIRED FOR HIS DISPOSITION: Booker brings a no-nonsense, bash-and-smash approach to his work up front. He told NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales he views football as "legal assault," and that his mission on every down is to make the players he's blocking "not love football."
THE USUAL SUSPECTS: A number of schools had multiple offensive linemen on display.
Texas was represented by offensive tackle Kelvin Banks Jr., guard Hayden Conner, center Jake Majors and offensive tackle Cameron Williams.
Oregon's contingent included offensive tackle Josh Conerly Jr. and offensive tackle Ajani Cornelius.
Ohio State center Seth McLaughlin, Jackson and Simmons were all on hand (Simmons is still recovering from patellar tendon surgery and didn't work out).
And Georgia had guard Dylan Fairchild, guard Tate Ratledge, guard Xavier Truss and center Jared Wilson in Indy.
All four of those schools qualified for the College Football Playoff in 2024.
Ohio State won the national championship.
"There's a pretty good correlation between the number of linemen here and winning a lot of games," NFL Network analyst Charles Davis observed.
FREAK SHOW: Membou shouted his way to a 4.91 on his first 40-yard dash at 6-foot-41/4 and 332 pounds.
It held up as official.
"You let out a primal scream when you do freaky stuff," Jeremiah reasoned. "That is fantastic."
Membou, not surprisingly, didn't bother to run a second 40.
"He's in the mix to be the first offensive lineman off the board," Jeremiah added.
Georgia center Jared Wilson (6-3, 310) came in .01 better than Membou with a first 40 of 4.90 that, likewise, held up as official.
For an encore, Wilson produced a 4.84 on his second 40 attempt which also ended up as an official time, the fifth-fastest time by an offensive lineman at a Combine since 2003 (tied with Richie Incognito in 2005).
Membou's 10-yard split, considered a more significant indicator than the 40 time for offensive linemen, was 1.74, tied for the fourth-best time in his offensive line group (two drilled on Day 4) behind Wilson's 1.71 (first attempt).
Membou and LSU offensive tackle Will Campbell joined Tampa Bay's Tristan Wirfs (in 2020) and San Francisco's Trent Williams (in 2010) as the only offensive linemen who registered a vertical leap of over 30 inches and a sub-5.00 40 at 315 or more pounds at a Combine since 2003.
Campbell's vertical this year was 32" and his 40 was 4.98 at 319 pounds.
Membou delivered a 34" vertical and also had a 9'7" broad jump.
"I was chasing the 4.8 in the 40 but 4.9 is pretty good," Membou told Dales. "Every team, they asked what I view myself as. I just told them I think I'm athletic enough to stay at tackle but I have the versatility to go dominate at guard.
"I'm just excited to bring my explosiveness and my ability to move D-linemen off the ball."
The average offensive lineman 40 time was 5.13, the fastest by an offensive line group at a Combine.
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE MEASURABLES: Campbell is widely regarded as one of the prized offensive line prospects in the draft but there are some who question whether he'll wind up at guard because of his 325/8-inch arms.
Campbell isn't among the concerned.
"It's no secret I don't have the stereotypical offensive lineman arms but I've never had them," he told Dales. "There were concerns when I was coming into college, I handled it fine. And, obviously, there's concerns now and I'm gonna handle it fine whenever a team gives me the opportunity."
College tackles with arms shorter than 33" often end up at guard in the NFL.
But to Campbell that's not necessarily a definitive indicator as to whether a player is better suited for guard or tackle.
Dales also reported Campbell told her "blocking is done with your feet."
AIN'T THAT TOUGH ENOUGH: Jackson didn't run 40s and looked to be struggling to a degree in drills. At one point he received attention from the medical staff and had his right thigh wrapped.
"I don't know that he looks super healthy," Jeremiah said. "You can see a strain on his face as well when he's trying to finish a drill. I admire the competitiveness but it's not necessary at this point. You got 55 starts at Ohio State, that's enough. I love you competing if you're healthy but if you're not 100 percent it's not worth that."
Added Davis, who worked on the field as well as upstairs at an anchor desk: "I said to him, 'Are you OK young man?' He just looked at me and defiantly said, 'I'm doing great,' and just went back to the line.
"He doesn't look right, I think everyone's kind of seeing there may be something a little bit off but he's doing his best to fight his way through it."

Top 2024 Moments: Defense pitches a second-half shutout
Contributing Writer/Editor
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second in a series of articles looking back at some of the highlights from the 2024 season.
After winning their open in Atlanta and then beating the Broncos on the road, the Steelers finally had their home opener in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Chargers, who also entered having won their first two games of the season and playing strong defense.
But the Steelers would do so without the services of outside linebacker Alex Highsmith, one of the cornerstones of the defense. Highsmith suffered a groin injury during the game that would sideline him for the next few weeks.
That was fine, as it turned out, because the Steelers also had second-year linebacker Nick Herbig, who did his best Highsmith impression, recording a pair of sacks and forcing a fumble.
"I'm not surprised by the performance," said fellow outside linebacker T.J. Watt. "He went out there and played with a lot of swag and confidence.
"That kid has supreme confidence in himself. You can't tell him anything. I respect the heck out of it. He's going to do everything that he possibly can to perform. He's going to ask every question. He's going to turn over every stone and just bust his tail. I respect the heck out of Nick, and I'm glad that he had the day that he did."
The Steelers allowed minus-5 yards of offense in the second half while keeping the Chargers out of the end zone. It was the fourth-fewest yards allowed by a team in a half since 2000.
The Chargers took a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter on a touchdown pass from Justin Herbert to Quentin Johnston.
They wouldn't reach the end zone again.
The Steelers tied the game at 7-7 on a 5-yard Justin Fields touchdown run before allowing a field goal at the end of the half as the Chargers took a 10-7 lead.
The Steelers nearly answered at the end of the half, as Field connected with George Pickens on a 27-yard pass to midfield before Chris Boswell was sent out to attempt a 62-yard field goal as time expired.
Boswell missed the attempt – one of just three misses he had all season – as the Chargers took a 10-7 to the half.
The Steelers tied the game at 10-10 on the opening possession of the second half on a Boswell field goal, and Herbig sacked Herbert on the Chargers' second play on the ensuing possession, aggravating an ankle injury he entered the game nursing.
Former Steelers linebacker Bud Dupree intercepted Fields on a tipped pass at the Los Angeles 41. But Elandon Roberts sacked Herbert on first down and Herbert handed the ball off to JK Dobbins twice before exiting the game following another Chargers punt.
The Steelers added another Boswell field goal early in the fourth quarter, and Fields tossed a 55-yard touchdown to Calvin Austin III on their next possession to put the Steelers ahead, 20-10.
The Steelers defense, meanwhile, clamped down on the Chargers, allowing minus-5 offensive yards in the second half, as they sacked Herbert and backup Taylor Heinicke five times, including two by Herbig. Los Angeles finished the game with just 166 yards of offense.
Fields completed 25-of-32 passes for 245 yards with a touchdown and interception while also rushing for a score. Najee Harris had 18 carries for 70 yards, while Austin had four receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown.
Patrick Queen had a team-high eight tackles.
The 20 points allowed by the Chargers matched their season-high in a road game in 2024.

5 for Friday: Get ready for the NFL Combine
Contributing Writer/Editor
The NFL Scouting Combine will kick off next week in Indianapolis, with some 329 draft-eligible players invited to be tested and interviewed by all 32 NFL teams.
There's obviously a lot of work that goes into the event, not only for the league, but for each of the teams.
NFL teams get seven draft picks allotted to them each season. Obviously, some of those change hands each year. The league also awards 32 compensatory picks each year, meaning, the draft is, in effect, eight rounds.
That means that 256 players are selected in the draft each year. It also means that a good number of the players who will attend the Combine next week will not be selected in the draft.
Of course, most of those players will then become undrafted rookie free agents, but there will be more about 200 of those signed by teams in the hours following the draft.
Just because a player isn't at the Combine doesn't mean he can't make it.
The players who attend the Combine are selected with input from all 32 teams and are chosen because the teams have a "draftable" grade on them.
But that also doesn't mean there aren't players who slip through the cracks. For example, Steelers cornerback Beanie Bishop wasn't invited to the Combine last season.
Bishop went undrafted, but wound up appearing in all 17 games for the Steelers last season working as a slot cornerback.
The draft is an inexact science, and it always will be, largely because there's just so much variance.
Players can be poked, prodded and tested. But what can't be necessarily measured is how they'll respond to being a professional player. The NFL season is more of a grind than the college season.
You have to have a true passion for the game to become great. Talent alone won't get it done.
And that passion is something that can be hard to measure. Every player is going to answer yes when asked if they love the game.
They would be foolish to not do so.
But sifting through who is talented and actually has that passion and who is faking it is a big part of the Combine interview process.
The Combine also begins the start of the offseason, as the new league year and free agency open March 12. News will be flying fast and furious starting next week.
• Steelers General Manager Omar Khan also will speak with the media for the first time since the 2024 season ended. And there will be plenty of questions for him as the Steelers prepare for free agency, which begins March 12, and the draft.
Obviously, many of the questions for Khan next week will revolve around what the team plans to do at quarterback.
But don't expect Khan to tip the team's hand and make any definitive announcements about anything. There's still plenty of negotiating to be done.
And it serves no purpose for the Steelers to tip their hand regarding their plans.
• The NFL Draft was reduced from 12 rounds to 8 in 1993. It then went to its current format of 7 rounds in 1994.
In that final year of a 12-round draft in 1992, the Steelers selected seven players in rounds 8 through 12, including safety Darren Perry in the eighth round and long-snapper Kendall Gammon in the 11th round. Perry was a long-time starter at free safety, recording 35 interceptions in his career, while Gammon was the first pure long-snapper in team history.
But they were hardly the only hits among the players selected in the eighth round and later that season.
The first player taken in the eighth round was safety Jason Belser by the Colts. He appeared in 173 games and recorded 14 career interceptions.
Fullback Sam Gash (New England) appeared in 177 career games, while Detroit selected defensive back Will Clay in the eighth round and he played in 118 career games.
In the ninth round, the biggest hit was Minnesota quarterback Brad Johnson, who played in two Pro Bowls and threw for nearly 30,000 career yards. But offensive linemen David Dixon and Jay Leeuwenburg also were both longtime NFL starters.
Round 10 produced linebackers Steve Grant and Elijah Alexander, fullback Tim Lester, a future Steeler, guard Jerry Ostroski and defensive back Mark McMillan. All became starters in the NFL.
The 11th and 12th rounds weren't quite as fruitful, with Gammon being one of the few players who stuck in the league for more than a couple of seasons – he appeared in 234 career games – but when you go 336 players deep as that draft did, that's par for the course.
The Steelers also had some good fortune mining those later rounds during the final years in which the draft went more than seven rounds.
Players such as Carlton Haselrig, Justin Strzelczyk, John Jackson, Jerry Olsavsky and Merril Hoge were all taken in the eighth round or later in those final drafts and would go on to become starters or key contributors.
• While it might not have always seemed like it, the Steelers finished the 2024 season as one of the top tackling teams in the NFL.
According to the NFL's NextGen Stats, the Steelers had a tackle efficiency rating of 89.1 percent, just .2 lower than that of the Chiefs.
That means the Steelers as a team made the tackle 89.1 percent of the time when they got their hands on an opposing ball carrier.
The team's most solid tackler was outside linebacker Alex Highsmith, who did not miss one – according to Pro Football Reference – despite taking part in 45 tackles.
Safety DeShon Elliott missed just three tackles in 111 chances, while fellow safety Minkah Fitzpatrick was credited with four in 100 opportunities.
• Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Pittonline@iheartmedia.com
As a team, according to Pro Football Reference, the Steelers missed just 69 tackles all season. That works out to 4 per game.
And remember, the Steelers played Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry (twice) last season, two players who combined to rush for nearly 4,000 yards.
• There is nothing more vapid than seeing predictions about the postseason and awards for the following NFL season in the hours and days following the conclusion of the previous season.
It creates talking points and things of that nature, but in reality, it's all meaningless.
For example, preseason mock drafts from a year ago had the Washington Commanders selecting in the top 5 of the draft again this year. They'll actually pick 29th after reaching the NFC Championship.
The Steelers, meanwhile, were largely tabbed to have a losing record, finish fourth in the AFC North and have a top-15 draft pick. That obviously didn't happen, either.
Meanwhile, plenty of prognostications had San Francisco winning the Super Bowl and teams such as the Browns, Bears, Dolphins and Jets, as teams poised to make deep runs in the playoffs.
None of that group sniffed the postseason.
Fact of the matter is, with free agency and the draft still yet to take place, a lot of teams are going to look a lot different three months from now than their current construction.

Triple Take: Ranking the top WRs in the draft
The Triple Take crew of Dale Lolley, Matt Williamson and Mike Prisuta take a look at the top prospects in the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft, which will be held in April. Today, they delve into the wide receiver position.
The opinions expressed here are their own and not those of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Dale's Take
We saw three wide receivers taken in the first nine picks of last year's draft and by the time the first round was complete, seven had been selected. This year's draft is not nearly that top-heavy. In fact, it's more deep than talented. While there will be good receivers to come out of this draft class, there aren't necessarily any that profile as future No. 1 performers for their respective teams.
That being said, there could be some surprises, as we'll see good players at the position taken in Rounds 3 and 4.
The wildcard will be Colorado's Travis Hunter. I, however, view him as a cornerback prospect who will play wide receiver as a secondary position.
Dale's Rankings
1. Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona, 6-4 1/8, 219 lbs. - A big receiver with good ball skills, McMillan was extremely productive, posting over 80 catches and 1,300 yards in each of the past two seasons, winning as a size mismatch. Will that translate to the NFL against bigger, more physically gifted receivers? We'll see. He has good run-after-the-catch ability but isn't necessarily a blazer. There's definitely a tantalizing skillset here.
2. Matthew Golden, Texas, 5-11, 191 lbs. - A transfer from Houston, Golden took a backseat to teammate Isaiah Bond in the preseason prognostications. But by season's end, Gold was the go-to player in the Texas offense. Gold works every level of the field well, is shifty and plays well through contact. Gold averaged 17 yards per catch last season, showing off his big-play ability that showed up with his blazing 4.29 40-yard dash at the combine..
3. Luther Burden, Missouri, 6-0, 206 lbs. - Burden looks like a Deebo Samuel clone, running through would-be tacklers with a running back-like skillset. Missouri threw him a lot of screens and short stuff to take advantage of his outstanding run-after-the-catch ability, but he can make plays downfield, as well. But because of his usage, it might take some time for him to develop his route running more efficiently.
4. Emeka Ebuka, Ohio State, 6-0 7/8, 202 lbs. - Ebuka has been on the radar for quite some time at Ohio State, which given the players the Buckeyes have produced is quite admirable. He's primarily been a slot receiver, however, and will need to show he can win consistently on the outside. Justin Jefferson made that move. Can Egbuka, or is he a slot-only candidate?
5. Jayden Higgins, Iowa State, 6-4 1/8, 214 lbs. - A big receiver with the ability to play inside or outside whose game is all about making adjustments. With a wingspan of a 6-7 player, Higgins plucks the ball away from or over defensive backs. Like McMillan, he has prototypical size to help him overwhelm defensive backs.
Sleeper: Jaylen Royals, Utah State, 6-0, 205 lbs. - After catching 71 passes for 1,000 yards and 15 touchdowns in 2023, Royals played just seven games in 2024 before missing the rest of the season with an injury. But he had 55 catches for 834 yards and six scores in those seven games. He's not a burner, but he reads coverages well and finds the right spot against zone. His ability to leverage defenders is how he wins against man. Royals isn't a burner, but he's a good football player.
Matt's Take
Exceptional overall groups of wide receivers in the draft is something we have almost become accustomed to year after year. This class doesn't appear to be as strong but that also doesn't mean it is lacking in talent.
First off, Colorado's Travis Hunter is clearly by top wide receiver in this class, and he will be drafted very early. But I have decided to leave Hunter off this list (and probably off my cornerback list as well) so we can have more names in the top five to discuss and compare. But Hunter aside, it will be very interesting to see when the first pure wideout is selected this year. Maybe it is as early as fourth overall to New England, but more likely, it might be a bit longer of a wait than we have usually seen.
But the second day of the draft should provide the league with plenty of future starting wide receivers from the slot or as outside options - and plenty of players that can do both. Also, it looks as though quite a few well-known veteran players at this position could be on the move this offseason and we have already seen Deebo Samuel traded from the 49ers to Washington. Expect a lot of wide receiver movement this year.
Matt's Rankings
1. Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona, 6-4 1/8, 219 lbs. - Flat-out speed is somewhat of a question with McMillan, who didn't run at the Combine. But over the past two seasons he led the FBS in combined receiving yardage (2,721), first downs (112), and receptions of 20+ yards (42). McMillan is a ball winner that works very well in tight spaces and uses his immense size greatly to his advantage. He adjusts very well to the football and can really go up and get it while also providing plenty of value after the catch. There are a lot of NFL touchdown receptions in McMillan's future. 2. Matthew Golden, Texas, 5-11, 191 lbs. - Golden really took over as Texas' top receiver this season. Watching him on tape, his ability to stop and start and come out of his breaks really stood out. He changes his speeds well and can attack a defense at all levels. Then Golden goes to Indianapolis and runs the best time of any wide receiver. Golden is nipping on McMillan's heals as the top player at this position.
3. Luther Burden III, Missouri, 6-0, 206 lbs. - Watching Burden's tape in 2023 vs. 2024 is very different - but it might not be his fault necessarily that he was way more productive two years ago. To be kind, Burden's supporting cast this past season was very lackluster and therefore, Missouri ran a very high percentage of wide receiver screens and quick hitters just to get the ball in the hands of the best player. Burden is well built and excels after the catch, but there isn't a ton to go off as an all-around route runner. 4. Emeka Egbuka, Ohio State, 6-0 7/8, 202 lbs. - Egbuka has been in the spotlight for years now at a big-time college program and has played with a bevy of amazing wide receivers at Ohio State - often as the second fiddle. He has the most catches in Ohio State history and the second-most receiving yards. Egbuka is a very reliable technician who does his best work in the slot, but certainly can align outside. He is a chain mover and should translate quickly to the league. 5. Elic Ayomanor, Stanford, 6-1 3/4, 206 lbs.- This final spot came down to Ayomanor or Iowa State's Jayden Higgins-both of whom have excellent size for the position. Ayomanor grew up in Canada with a hockey background and he brings that rugged approach to the football field. The Stanford offense really struggled this past season, but Ayomanor was a clear bright spot and is one of the only receivers to get the better of Hunter when Stanford did battle with Colorado. This is still somewhat of a raw prospect, but Ayomanor's Combine showing was very promising.
Sleeper: Dont'e Thornton Jr., Tennessee, 6-4 5/8, 205 lbs. - Big and very fast. That is a great place to start with a downfield receiver, which is exactly what Thornton is. He ran a 4.30/40 at the Combine. Only Golden was faster. But as is the case with many Tennessee players, Thornton was used heavily in a rotation - and the Volunteers offense is not an easy one to transition to into the NFL. And Thornton did not run an extensive route tree at college. But he does show physicality through his route and an ability to beat man coverage. Thornton averaged 21.9 yards per catch at Tennessee.
Mike's Take
The talent pool at wide receiver is such that it's easy to come up with a Top 5 at the position, one that includes four or five potential first-round selections, and still have a dozen or so names left over that absolutely intrigue, for one reason or another.
If your team needs one would you be disappointed if the name on the card when the time comes to go get one winds up being Jack Bech of TCU? Or, Jayden Higgins of Iowa State? Or, Tre Harris of Mississippi?
There are traditionally plenty of wide receivers available, and this year is no exception.
Maybe not as many as there have been in past years, but enough.
It all depends on what you're looking for and when.
But they're out there, waiting to be taken.
Mike's Rankings
1. Travis Hunter, Colorado, 6-0, 188 lbs. - Hunter caught 96 passes for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns while also playing cornerback. He'll most likely have to play one position or the other in the NFL, but he can play both at a high level. And, just maybe, dabble as a two-way player if a certain set of circumstances dictates. It's good to have options.
2. Emeka Egbuka, Ohio State, 6-0 7/8, 202 lbs. - There has seemingly been an endless progression of wide receivers from Ohio State to the NFL in recent seasons. Egbuka is next in line. Beyond the numbers he is reportedly perceived in the scouting community as a player who will be a captain at the NFL level "very quickly." His game is polished and he blocks.
3. Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona, 6-4 1/8, 219 lbs. - He can score from distance and he can score in the red zone (26 career touchdown receptions in 37 career games at Arizona). He plays with the physicality his size suggests and his 213 career receptions include many of the acrobatic variety, including a few that defy description if not gravity.
4. Matthew Golden, Texas, 5-11, 191 lbs. - Golden is more than a player capable of covering 40 yards in 4.29 seconds, but any analysis of his potential and projected impact at the next level has to start there. He had a breakout 2024 season in Texas (58 receptions, 987 yards, a 17.0-yard average per catch and nine touchdowns) after two statistically average campaigns with Houston (a combined 988 receiving yards). Golden may be just getting started.
5. Luther Burden III, Missouri, 6-0, 206 lbs. - Burden ran a 4.41 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. That isn't "Golden fast" but it's fast enough for Burden to excel as a run-after-the-catch wide receiver and as one who is capable of taking the top off of a defense.
Sleeper: Savion Williams, TCU, 6-4, 222 lbs. - He won't sleep long and he won't hit snooze. Not with the "Wildcat QB" component Williams will bring to his eventual NFL team. Williams caught  60 passes for 611 yards and six touchdowns in 2024. He also carried 51 times for 322 yards and six more scores. His NFL comparison in the eyes of some is Cordarrelle Patterson. Are you not entertained?

Asked and Answered
Asked and Answered: Feb. 26
Steelers.com
Let's get to it:
BETH GOLLMAR FROM ATLANTA, GA: Is this year's draft class good at defensive end? Should this be the year they have to draft a guy to replace Cam Heyward even if they get a "project" guy? He could learn for a year and then be able to step in. Or should they draft high enough to get a guy who could step in and give Cam a breather while he gets accustomed to the NFL? ANSWER: Based on projections the defensive line talent pool to be available in the 2025 NFL Draft is supposed to be one of the deeper position groups. I am on record as being of the opinion that the Steelers need to invest in their defensive line the way they have over the past few offseasons with their offensive line. And I also believe the way to get top-quality defensive linemen is to draft them, as opposed to shopping in free agency, because top quality defensive linemen aren't usually allowed to get to the open market by their original teams. There just aren't a lot of them, and so if you have one you want to keep him. What I believe the Steelers need along the defensive line is a player who can be an eventual replacement for Cam Heyward, but I also think if the defense is going to be elite it needs another Stephon Tuitt – and by that comparison I mean a guy who can contribute to the pass rush and also be sufficiently stout against the run. That's what you need when an opponent presents a combination of Derrick Henry-Lamar Jackson or Saquon Barkley-Jalen Hurts. You have to be able to pressure the quarterbacks, because if those guys are not pressured they will kill you. And at the same time you have to be able to control the run playing nickel because loading up against the run will open things up for their receivers.
Cam Heyward is an all-time great, but he'll be 36 years old in May. Father Time is still undefeated, and understand that the top two defensive linemen in Steelers history came to the team as No. 1 picks. Tuitt – 34.5 sacks in 91 games, along with 93 hits on the quarterback, 13 passes defensed, 6 forced fumbles, and 176 combined tackles – was a No. 2 pick (46th overall) in the 2014 NFL Draft. That kind of draft capital is what has to be invested for those kinds of defensive linemen, and great defenses have those kinds of defensive linemen.
RONALD WALL FROM SHADY VALLEY, TN: What's the difference between being waived and being released? It seems that either way a team is letting a player go, so why can't a waived player decide which team he wants to play for? ANSWER: Because the rule that governs players being "let go" is that guys with 4 or more accrued NFL seasons are able to decide which team he wants to play for and at what price, and guys with fewer than 4 accrued NFL seasons are subject to waivers. Waivers is a 24-hour period where 31 other teams can submit a claim, and then the player is awarded to the team with the worst record – the same method used to determine draft order. There is a time at the end of a regular season where all released players must go through waivers, but that's a competitive issue. That's the rule, and it is the result of a negotiation between the league and the players union.
MARK HONSAKER FROM GALVESTON, TX: I believe in Justin Fields but am also of the opinion that a year or two of tutelage under another quarterback to show him some of the intricacies of the position would be helpful in bringing out the best in his abilities. As such, and I believe Aaron Rodgers fits this mold more than a Mathew Stafford, what do you think about signing Rodgers to be the mentor/tutor, so to speak, so we have Rodgers as the No. 1 QB for a year or two and then turning things over to Fields? ANSWER: In a world where players aren't people, that's a nice idea, but it's just not real. Justin Fields is not going to sign a contract with a team where he's to be mentored by a veteran for a year or two. And the veteran guys you mention have no interest in signing with a team planning to use him as a de facto coach until the pupil is ready to take over.
SAM WILEY FROM MIDDLETOWN, RI: Can you give some insight into the difference between, say Matt Stafford's team finding his value on the trade market and the legal tampering period? ANSWER: To be as simple as possible, it's all about permission. In exploring a player's value on the trade market, both sides of the trade have to be amenable to the terms for the transaction to happen. The legal tampering period pertains to free agents, and it's more contained. The NFL actually sanctions it as anything goes. The legal tampering period this year is from noon on March 10 until 3:59 p.m. on March 12, because at 4 p.m. on March 12 the gates to free agency will be swung open.
MARK CUSICK FROM PARADISE VALLEY, AZ: I have seen different assumptions in the media about whether the Steelers have two or three picks in the seventh round of this year's draft. What is the origin of this confusion? ANSWER: I have no interest in how or why there was "confusion," which in this particular case is nothing more than reporting incorrectly. But in this forum, the Steelers always have been listed as having seven total picks in the 2025 NFL Draft – 1 in each of the first 5 rounds and 2 in the 7th round.
MICHAEL GREEN FROM MIAMI, FL: My question is in regard to the "tush push." If the QB or ball carrier is elevated off the ground by the pushers, shouldn't that be a penalty? My understanding was that a player couldn't use another player to get higher or jump? ANSWER: There is way more pushing and pulling happening during a tush-push than lifting and carrying. But I don't see the league eliminating the play unless definitive injury information is compiled and presented showing it to be dangerous.
ROB FORTIN FROM MANSFIELD, SD: What are your thoughts on hiring Hines Ward as the receivers coach if he was available? I loved watching Hines, Antwan Randel El, and Plaxico Burress all block downfield for the running backs. The Steelers need the physical play that he brought. ANSWER: Hines Ward is not available now, because he's the receivers coach at Arizona State. And allow me to caution people about the assumption that a great player can teach what made him great to the next generation. I cannot speak to the kind of coach Ward is, what he teaches, what he emphasizes to the players, but you can't teach a player to be great. He has to have it in him to start with.
THOMAS MILINOVICH FROM ERIE, PA: As we get closer to March 12 free agent signing time, could you give us the time line as to when teams can contact players, make offers to players, and then announce the signing of the new player? ANSWER: As I wrote in an above answer, the legal tampering period is from noon on March 10 until 3:59 p.m. on March 12, and that's when teams are allowed legally to contact potential free agents and make offers to them. Starting at 4 p.m. on March 12, all untagged unrestricted free agents are allowed to sign with any team at whatever price. When the signing team chooses to make an announcement is its decision, but such news can be "announced" by the player himself on social media.
JOHN CURLEY FROM CHAPTICO, MD: Historically, are the Steelers more likely to pay more attention to one college football program vs. another? Meaning that program is more in-line with Steelers football so the transition from college to professional is easier on the player. Also, because some veterans of the military have played professional football, how much attention is paid to the military academies? ANSWER: The inaugural NFL Draft (Player Selection Meeting is what it was called initially) was in 1936, and the Steelers have participated in every one of them. That leads to a lot of history. The Steelers have drafted more players from the University of Pittsburgh (46) than any other college program, but a lot of the geographic component of that came when scouting was a much more regional endeavor. As for the military academies, the Steelers have drafted 3 players from West Point and 1 player from the Naval Academy. Rocky Bleier served in Vietnam, but he went to Notre Dame; Alejandro Villanueva went to West Point, but he was undrafted. Those are two players who would be examples of military veterans who don't count on any list of guys drafted from the academies.
RON WILLIAMS FROM ASTORIA, OR: No question but instead a compliment to Rob King as the new voice of the Steelers in 2024. He had a very difficult task following Bill Hillgrove, but my opinion is he was very good, very well prepared and professional. Rob also worked very seamlessly with Craig Wolfley in the booth. ANSWER: Beside my wife, those guys are two of the biggest fans of Asked and Answered, and so I'm sure they appreciate your kind words.
CARL WYNN FROM SUNNYVALE, TX: This is to the fan who thinks the Steelers should have drafted Tyler Guyton instead of Troy Fautanu. I am a Steelers fan living in the Dallas area. With that, I have the misfortune of getting to watch the Cowboys weekly, and I can tell that fan that Tyler Guyton may not be the kind of player he thinks he is. In fact, throughout last season I delighted in hearing the talking radio heads here after most games as they whined and complained about young Mr. Guyton. According to them, it seemed if he wasn't holding, or killing drives, he was getting beat on a pass rush. Many fans consider Guyton to be the end to a recent streak of highly successful offensive linemen taken in the first round by the Cowboys. As you wrote, time will tell if Guyton or Fautanu will be more successful. But the early reviews, at least among Cowboys faithful, are not in Guyton's favor. Thank you, Steelers, for taking Troy Fautanu. ANSWER: And thank you for sharing.

Rookie Recap: Spencer Anderson
Steelers.com
When an offensive lineman is selected in the seventh round, the immediate thought by many is they just won't be able to make it, won't be able to find a spot on the roster. At best, landing on the practice squad until they settle in is an option.
But tackle Spencer Anderson beat the odds.
Anderson, the Steelers final pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, the 251st pick overall, made the team's 53-man roster and spent the entire season on it.
While Anderson didn't see a lot of playing time, with very few snaps on offense while seeing more on special teams, he did play in eight games as well as the team's AFC Wild Card game.
One of the biggest things Anderson brings to the table is his versatility. He has the ability to play all five positions on the line, although tackle is his main spot. But when it comes to dressing an extra offensive lineman, that versatility is a key.
"It does help me a lot," said Anderson. "A lot of times teams only carry seven, eight or nine offensive linemen and most of the time guys aren't able to snap the ball or play guard and tackle. Some guys are only position specific. Me having experience at all five, even a handful of snaps at left tackle, that helps me a lot. Snapping the ball, a lot of guys don't like to snap the ball or have the overall knowledge for it.
"I pride myself on being a football nerd. I pay attention to defensive coverage. I pay attention to tendencies. Little things like that. When you know it, it slows the game down. It helps you a lot. You aren't processing as much in your brain and the game comes easier to you."

Checking boxes that matter, recalling Minkah Fitzpatrick
Steelers.com
The second day of the NFL Scouting Combine included offensive players on display for the first time, as tight ends joined defensive backs for on-field drills at Lucas Oil Stadium.
Following is a look at some of the highlights of the NFL Network's coverage of Day Two in Indianapolis:
NO TIME WASTED: Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell made a statement 18 reps into the running of 40-yard dashes, the drill that kicked off the festivities this afternoon.
Mitchell, one of the early and high-profile risers in the pre-draft evaluation process, clocked a 4.33 40 on his first attempt, which wound up holding up as the second-fastest 40 run by a cornerback.
"The box has been checked," NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah declared. "Tape? Check. Senior Bowl? Check. Forty? Check."
Mitchell, 6-foot, 195 pounds, made plenty of similar such statements last season and at the Senior Bowl.
"A mixture of Marshon Lattimore and Darius Slay is what one evaluator told me," NFL Network analyst Charles Davis reported.
Lattimore went 11th overall to the Saints in 2017.
Slay was a second-round pick of the Lions (36th overall) in 2013.
Jeremiah listed Mitchell as the 15th-best prospect available prior to the Combine.
That might no longer apply.
"You start asking yourself, if you're a team that needs a corner and you're picking up there in the top 10, what's to keep you from taking him all the way up there?" Jeremiah wondered aloud. "He's literally done everything you can do. The athleticism is elite, the ball skills are elite, the competitiveness.
"He's an impressive dude."
Mitchell ran a second 40 at 4.38.
The NFL Network simulcast his first 40 with Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner's 4.41 from 2022 for perspective.
As the numbers would suggest, Mitchell comfortably prevailed in that graphics-generated matchup.
NFL Network analyst Peter Schrager mentioned Mitchell had been asked about playing in the Mid-American Conference and replied he considered himself the best player in MAC history.
"So, no shortage of confidence there," Schrager noted. "He said, 'I'm not here to be mediocre. I'm here to break records.'"
BRIEF APPEARANCE: Clemson cornerback Nate Wiggins posted a scorching 4.28 40, the fastest in his position group, but emerged worse for the experience.
NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales said Wiggins told her his issue was a hip flexor/strain and that he was done for the day.
"He believes he'll be ready for Clemson's Pro Day on April 6," Dales added.
ALONE AT THE TOP: The tight end group consists of Georgia's Brock Bowers, and then everyone else.
"It's extremely top heavy, meaning there's one at the very top," Jeremiah assessed.
Jeremiah likened Bowers to Dallas Clark, "just a more explosive version."
Ja'Tavion Sanders of Texas is Jeremiah's No. 2 at the position, "but there's a whole host of them competing to be that third guy."
THE NEED FOR SPEED: Jeremiah maintained 40 times and testing results that reflect explosiveness are critically impactful in how cornerbacks are evaluated.
"The 40 and the testing numbers matter more for this group than any other position," Jeremiah insisted. "If I'm a corner and I run 4.6 trying to cover a guy who runs 4.3 and he takes off, I can't get there. The speed matters more at this position than any other one.
"And there's a difference between game speed and time speed, of course. But guys, I've been in the (draft) room and seen players adjusted on the board off of testing at this position far more than any other position. You could go a whole year and we might not see you in a lot of man-coverage. You might not have seen a lot of fast receivers this year on tape in your conference. This is where these numbers, they really, really matter with this group."
SAFETY FIRST: Some of the safety discussion involved the importance of consistently being in the right spot from snap to snap and making the right play when it needs to be made.
By definition, that's how the position is played.
"You talk about tackling and just making the plays," Jeremiah offered. "I think it was (Browns defensive coordinator) Jim Schwartz who said, 'They call it a 'safety,' not a 'risky.''"
SHINING EXAMPLE: Minnesota's Tyler Nubin is one of the most highly-regarded safeties, in part because of his perceived intelligence and instincts.
Those aren't qualities Nubin developed by accident.
"His favorite study is (Steelers safety) Minkah Fitzpatrick, with the intelligence, the intangibles," Dales reported.
Fitzpatrick's drill work in 2018 was highlighted as an example of how it's done in Indy.
"Man, everything he does is smooth and easy," Jeremiah observed of Fitzpatrick, recognized then as "DB No. 51."

Thankful to be able to share with others
Steelers.com
It's a time of year when we all give thanks and count our blessings for what we have. For Steelers players, they are making sure those in the Pittsburgh area who need a helping hand receive blessings as well.
Over the past few weeks, players have spread those blessings in the community, providing warm, comforting Thanksgiving meals for individuals, as well as providing turkeys and all the fixings for others to have their own holiday dinner at home.
The Steelers have partnered with multiple agencies to give back this year, making sure the most vulnerable have food on their table or a warm meal this holiday season.
"Playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers is not only having excellence on the field, but also off the field as well," said Blayre Holmes-Davis, the Steelers senior director of community relations. "There is an expectation that when you have time, you give back to the community, you step up because there's a lot of people that are in need and a lot of people that aren't as fortunate as they are.
"It's great to continue to see that momentum with a lot of our guys who've been here for years, but especially a lot of our guys who are new to the area be able to say they want to help and ask what organization they can partner with."

The Steelers teamed up with the Pirates and Penguins once again for a #BurghProud Thanksgiving Meal Distribution, with players, coaches and staff from all three teams joining forces to distribute turkeys and all the fixings to hundreds in conjunction with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and Giant Eagle.
The three teams came together as one in an effort to fight food insecurity in the city.
"This partnership with all three sports teams, being able to provide food to families that are in need, is really important," said Holmes-Davis. "The food bank has seen an increase, even post-Covid, in families still needing food, especially during the holidays. We want to make sure that everybody is able to have a meal and to just break bread and spend time together.
"It's really important for the guys to take part and make sure they're able to give that to families, but not only give it, but actually make sure as those cars come up to give them everything that they'll need for their meal and just to say have a great Thanksgiving."
The group has done this the last few years to share with those in the community who are struggling during the holiday season, greeting everyone with smiles and boundless energy.
Approximately 300 families were able to receive their Thanksgiving meal at the drive-up distribution held outside of PNC Park, with an assist from the players and staff.
"It makes the city know that we prioritize giving back, not only one individual sports team, but all three of us," said Holmes-Davis. "Having a partnership just levels up that impact of saying all three of us are coming together because we know this is such a big need, but we all love to work together, we all love to do community stuff.
"Any time that the city can see all three sports teams come together, and more importantly our players, to be able to see them come together to serve people in their community, it's just a great opportunity."
Gathering around the table for a holiday meal is a tradition for families, talking about life and sharing stories.
That is exactly why safety Deshon Elliott wanted to gather a group of local teens to give them the same type of experience.
Elliott hosted a group of teens, ages 12-16, youth from Young Black Motivated Kings and Queens for an intimate Thanksgiving dinner where he encouraged them to have discussions around mental health and overcome adversity.
"It was an opportunity to talk, have togetherness," said Elliott. "For me, it's important because since I've been in the NFL, we don't get a chance to really experience Thanksgiving. My family lives kind of far away. It's hard to go through that time without the people you love the most.
"I think it's cool to have that conversation with those kids. It's about your friends, people that you trust and talk to about any situation. Hopefully they did enjoy that. Hopefully they enjoyed the time together."
Elliott wanted the conversation to happen in a welcoming manner, which is why he hosted the dinner to put everyone in a comfortable situation.
"We wanted to make it as comfortable as possible," said Elliott. "Everybody felt comfortable, they were able to be open, express how they felt about their situations.
"I'm sure people there were friends and some people didn't know each other. But I could tell by the end of the dinner that everyone felt comfortable enough to laugh, talk to each other and really get to know each other. And that was the main part for me.
"There were a couple of kids at the start of it, you could tell they were in a shell, and by the middle of it they started opening up, expressing how they felt and joining in the conversations. I think kids are hilarious. I'm a very honest person, so once I started being honest about how I felt, they shared how they felt, chirping in on certain conversations that we had, I just felt like at that point we we're going down the right path."
What Elliott loved was when he left, he felt like he got as much out of it as the kids themselves did.
"When I left and drove home, I was thinking that was so refreshing," said Elliott. "I have some things going on with myself. So just being able to talk to them and get those things out, it was really nice."
Ever since he entered the NFL, quarterback Justin Fields made a commitment to helping others, especially during the holidays.
And he is continuing that by hosting a Thanksgiving Dinner for the 412 Youth Zone, an agency dedicated to supporting young adults, aged 16 to 23, who are transitioning out of the foster care system or facing unstable housing, in their transition to adulthood. Their mission is to provide a safe and welcoming environment where young people from Allegheny County can find the stability, support, and resources they need to reach their goals and achieve their aspirations.
"This time of year, you emphasize being around family, togetherness and stuff like that," said Fields. "I feel like giving back to people who might not have that opportunity, or who aren't as blessed to be in this situation as some of us might be, is important.
"It's important to show them that you care and to provide them the experience of togetherness. That's why I like to give back at Thanksgiving and Christmas."
Fields did a similar event in Chicago in 2023, working with the Empowerment Church to provide dinner at The Red Door Meeting Place for those who needed a lift.
"We provided the food and went there and served it to the people," said Fields. "Those things matter."
One of the things that matters most to Fields is being there for others, giving of his time to show that he cares and wants to make a difference.
"I want them to know that I'm present, that I am there for them," said Fields. "We're at a spot where people know who we are, but don't really know who you are. So, it's always good sitting down with them and getting to know different people and them getting to know us on a personal level.
"I think it's different when you're talking to somebody and having a conversation with someone one-on-one rather than following you on Instagram or social media, or something like that.
"I love giving back and love putting a smile on people's faces."
When the Steelers made a commitment to tight end Pat Freiermuth earlier this year, signing him to a contract extension, he wanted to return the favor and commit himself to the Pittsburgh community.
And throughout this season, he has done just that, with the holidays the main time he wants to do his part to help others.
That is why Freiermuth hosted a Thanksgiving dinner for 50 kids at the Carnegie Boys and Girls Club. It was an opportunity for the kids to have a traditional Thanksgiving meal with their friends, while feeling the warm spirit of the holiday.
"With the long-term investment the team made in me, I want to be able to give back as much as I can in the community while I'm here," said Freiermuth. "Every time I can do that, I try to do something."
Freiermuth also provided gift cards for the kids' families to help them purchase Thanksgiving meals for a dinner at home with the ones they love.
"This is the time of year when there's a lot of people struggling," said Freiermuth. "This time of the year is very important to me. I was very fortunate growing up that I was able to have food on the table during the holidays and be with family and stuff.
"Being the position I am in now, being able to help ones that aren't as fortunate as myself to be able to have a nice meal on Thanksgiving, be able to get stuff for Christmas. So, it means a lot to me to be able to help."
One of the most important aspects for Freiermuth is to be there in person to do the events, connect with kids and others and let them see that he truly cares.
"Being able to meet the kids, talk to them, understand their background and stuff is special," said Freiermuth. "It helps me grow as a person, helps me influence the community as best I can."
Defensive tackle Cameron Heyward hosted his annual Thanksgiving food distribution, holding it at the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.
Heyward, who was joined by some of his teammates for the event, handed out turkeys as well as aided the families with shopping at the on-site market the food bank now offers.
"During the holiday season, people usually are gathering around with families and sometimes there's insecurity behind it," said Heyward. "Hopefully we can just help out, provide a meal that people are looking for and help fight that insecurity they are feeling."
Heyward's efforts are a continuation of what he has done throughout his career earned him the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. He has continually worked with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, understanding how great the need is in the Western Pennsylvania area.
"It's a small thing we're doing," said Heyward. "We are trying to help as much as we can. It's all about doing your part and helping others.
"When the holidays come around, the need definitely is stronger. People are trying to do what they can to get through things. We just want to do what we can do."
The food bank has provided the Pittsburgh community with nearly 48 million meals, something they know wouldn't be possible without the combined efforts of everyone in the region, including Heyward.
His hope, now, is to see others get involved, to inspire people to give back to agencies like the food bank and others which are helping those in the community who are fighting food insecurity.
"Maybe if people see this type of thing, it inspires them to give to something like the food bank," said Heyward. "I really do hope it inspires and just becomes contagious. It's about everyone giving back, myself, my teammates, our community and our country."
Defensive end Larry Ogunjobi has made it a tradition to give back at the holidays, hosting his third annual Thanksgiving dinner for families served by the YWCA in Pittsburgh.
Ogunjobi spent an evening with the families, serving dinner and visiting with the individuals.
"I think it's important because you have families there, you have kids there," said Ogunjobi. "Thanksgiving is one of those holidays that was always big to my family. So just being able to spend time and give back is always going to be important to me."
One of the favorite parts of the event for Ogunjobi is seeing the joy he is able to bring to families who just need an extra helping hand during a time of year when they struggle to make ends meet.
"They're super happy," said Ogunjobi. "Sometimes you don't understand how much it means. Nobody wants to be in that situation where you have to go to places like that. But when you get there and it's a lot of open arms welcoming you and a lot of smiles, it really helps.
"The kids are always happy. At first, they don't know if they want to come back for seconds and all that kind of stuff. But you tell them there's plenty and it's all for them. It was a really cool experience to see how they reacted."
In addition to providing the dinner, Ogunjobi gave the families gift cards to help them provide their own at home dinner, giving them the opportunity to enjoy Thanksgiving Day the way so many other families do.
"I think the togetherness part is really cool, coming together as a community," said Ogunjobi. "But when they are able to spend time together as their own family, that is super important to spend time together and really just enjoy the holiday with their own family."

Steelers Nation Unite
A special black and gold bond
Steelers.com
Football is family, and for Taylor Sinnott, that rings true.
Sinnott's love of football, and the Steelers, came from her late father, Garth Sinnott, whose family is from Western Pennsylvania. While she grew up in La Mirada, California, Pittsburgh and the Steelers were always a part of her life.
And now, they are an even bigger part as she was selected as the 2024 Steelers Fan of the Year. All 32 teams select a Fan of the Year with each one attending Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans as the guest of the NFL. One winner is selected, which includes fan voting , to be the NFL Fan of the Year.
Sinnott was nominated by her mother, Bernadette Sinnott, because of that passion that started with her father, who unexpectedly passed away in 2023 from a heart attack. The father and daughter had an unbreakable bond through football, so much so that she even brought up football when she delivered his eulogy.
Bernadette Sinnott saw something on social media about nominating someone for the Fan of the Year, and she knew she had to share her daughter's story.
"Her dad's legacy is going to live on no matter what, but now it's a little part of history with her winning this," said her mother. "And we get to share it with everybody. If you would have said a year ago that I would have joy in my heart again, I would have said probably not. But I do have to say it brought joy to my heart."
Sinnott learned that she was selected to represent the Steelers on a call with defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, while she was at work as a Child Life Specialist at a children's hospital in Long Beach, California.
-->> **Vote for 2024 Steelers Fan of the Year**
"We're excited for you. We understand you do great work," said Heyward on the call. "Good things happen to good people, and we just want to say thank you.
"We heard your story. It was cool to hear about you and your dad. We think you'll be a great representative of Steelers Nation, and we are happy to have you.
"Just hearing the story about your dad, losing my dad, it warmed my heart to see what you did in the community, how you gave back. We're very excited to have you represent the Steelers. And I love how you take time to take care of your patients."
To say Sinnott was shocked by the news is an understatement.
"Oh my God," was about all she could muster when Heyward shared the news. "I have no words. I really don't know what to say. I am speechless. That's amazing. That's so cool. I am so excited."
Sinnott, who is the Steelers first female nominee for the honor, said once the call ended it all hit her.
"Looking back, there's so many more things that I wish I had said," said Sinnott. "To see him on the screen, it truly was amazing. And just hearing him compare mine and my dad's relationship to his and his dad because I know his dad also passed away when he was young. That was something special to hear from him. And it brought a tearto my eye.
"This means everything. Honestly, I had a really rough couple of years, so to have something this exciting happen to me and for it to still be tied to my dad and making him proud, it's a great thing."
Sinnott said for as long as she remembers she has been a Steelers fan, and she has the pictures to prove it.
"One of the things that you found me wearing most in pictures growing up, I was in Jerome Bettis Steelers jersey," said Sinnott. "I didn't exactly know what it meant then, but it was just something that I grew up with. I didn't know anything else, or want to know anything else, and it was definitely something special.
"Watching games with my dad growing up, we were always watching football on Sundays together, and then as I got older, traditions changed. Having a beer together and watching the game and then eventually going to games together, being able to travel with him.
"He played football growing up. He played on the defense and then he actually coached football at my high school. He definitely taught me the ins and outs of every defensive play, the game in general, but mostly defense. And I think that's where my love for Steelers defense comes from. Thanks to him I was able to watch them and be able to understand what's going on."
While the two went to games on the West Coast whenever they could, they made their first trip together to Pittsburgh in 2018, a memory that will last a lifetime.
"We did this amazing trip a few years back where we flew to Baltimore and we had front row seats in the end zone at the Ravens-Steelers game, and we won that game," recalled Sinnott. "And then we did a road trip from there to Pittsburgh, and we stopped at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Ohio. Then we watched a Thursday night game at Acrisure Stadium.
"Just being able to share memories like that is amazing. And that's really where it all started for me was through my dad. It's kind of exciting to now have this on my own, but still bring him along with me. He never went to the stadium in Las Vegas, but I wore his jersey there to bring him along with me. And I plan to do that every time I go to an away game."
When they weren't at the games, for the most part they would be at home, watching in the living room, and doing their special routines. They would each use the same cup for their drinks every game. They had the same game day meals. And they even adjusted the temperature on the thermostat to match the game day temperature wherever the team was playing.
"Growing up, when I was in middle school, high school, we would always go somewhere to watch the game on Sunday with one of my one of our family friends," said Sinnott. "We would meet at restaurants and watched the game there. Then we started staying home. We had Steelers cups we always used. And my dad was a little crazy. Whatever the temperature of the field was, we would turn the A.C. down to meet the temperature. My mom was always bundled up and freezing and some of our friends, and they would come over and be like, it's game day weather."
In her role as a child life specialist, Sinnott is able to use her love of football to identify with patients, especially some of the young male patients in the hospital. From chats in their hospital rooms to playing video games, Madden in particular, it makes a connection that helps them during tough times.
"We have a lot of teen patients and specifically, for whatever reason, we have a lot of teen boys right now," said Sinnott. "I really try and get on a deeper level with them and talk to them as if I was someone their age, talk about things that they are interested in. I've worked with so many patients and families, and even a lot of my families, their extended families are from Pittsburgh. It connects you so much more."
And being connected, that is what Sinnott thrived on with her father, a connection that was unbreakable. While she is thrilled to represent the Steelers in the fashion she is, there is an empty spot inside of her that her father isn't there to enjoy it with her.
"Daughters and their dads, sometimes when they're younger, they're super close," said Sinnott. "Once they get older, they kind of lose that interest, just because guys aren't always able to relate to their young daughters. So having that as the focal point of our relationship and having something to do together every week and talk about during the week, it was special. I was in group messages with my dad and his friends who are also Steelers fans. Since my dad has passed, I've stayed in the group messages with his friends, and we talk about the Steelers. It's nice to have that tie.
"My dad would be so excited about this. Before he passed, our goal was to go to every single stadium. So, when I went to the game in Vegas, I wore his jersey to bring him along with me. And I'm going to continue doing that.
"I know if he was here with all of this going on, he would absolutely be losing his mind. It's definitely bittersweet. It's a fun celebration, but it is tough just because he's not here to live it with me."

Wilson is Digest Player of the Week
Steelers.com
RUSSELL WILSON Quarterback
Players at his position are measured by wins and losses, and the Steelers had their 2024 season end with a 28-14 loss to the Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium in the Wild Card round. But Russell Wilson provided the team with representative quarterback play.
Wilson completed 20-of-29 (69 percent) for 270 yards, with 2 touchdowns, no interceptions, and a rating of 121.3. Six of Wilson's completions were good for 20-plus yards and went to 5 different receivers, including both of his touchdowns. Wilson is the Steelers Digest Player of the Week.
Also considered were DT Cam Heyward, who had 10 tackles, including 2 for loss; WR George Pickens, who caught 5 passes for 87 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown; and ILB Elandon Roberts, who led the team with 14 tackles.

Showing support for great causes with their cleats
Steelers.com
Steelers players can often be seen wearing custom cleats during pregame warmups, but this week against the Cleveland Browns custom cleats will be the norm during the game.
For the ninth straight year the NFL is allowing players to represent a charity that touches them deeply in a unique manner with the league's player cause initiative, My Cause My Cleats.
The initiative was created for NFL players to showcase a charitable cause in order to bring attention to it, and the players take part in helping with the design of their cleats.
After the players wear the cleats, they have the option to auction them off to raise money for their cause on NFL Auction, with 100% of the funds raised given to the charity. Fans may bid on player cleats at NFL.com/Auction.
Learn more about what causes are special to Steelers' players below and check back for updated photos of their cleats.

Calvin Anderson Cause: Lanihun-Anderson Foundation
Offensive tackle Calvin Anderson is supporting a cause close to his heart this week for his cleats.
Anderson, and his wife Sheree Lanihun-Anderson, started the Lanihun-Anderson Foundation to serve as a baseline of financial health and peace for others. Their mission is to bridge the financial disparity gap by providing knowledge, resources and opportunities to others.
"We started the foundation with a focus on financial literacy," said Anderson. "Both of us have identified that a lot of people, especially in their early adult life, are distracted by trying to manage their finances and understand how to budget. Really simple principles that I think they would benefit greatly from if they learned those as early as possible. So, we try to target high school and middle school aged kids and just teach them fundamental financial literacy building blocks, like how to budget and what to do when you have a certain amount of money. When they get their first job, for example, they can build a structure that hopefully when they grow into having a professional income, that they have some understanding of what they want to do with their money so they can alleviate that stress and focus on the things that everybody has. Aptitudes that they are gifted with so they can focus on those things as opposed to figuring out how to do with finances."
Anderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is.
"I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger," said Anderson. "So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time."
Spencer Anderson Cause: Autism Speaks
Spencer Anderson's heart told him that the cause he chose for his cleats as a part of My Cause My Cleats was the right choice to make.
While it's nothing that has touched his family directly, it has impacted several people close to him and that is why he selected Autism Speaks to represent with his cleats.
"I feel like it's one of those things that isn't talked about often enough," said Anderson. "One of my close friends is autistic. I have known a lot of people growing up that were autistic. I feel like a lot of people don't understand. It's kind of frowned upon. People will whisper, will say he has autism you have to be easy with him.
"They are normal people. I have interacted with many of them. It's not talked about enough. The cases aren't as common as cancer, mental health, but it's something people should be aware of.
"I have a close family friend, a friend of my mom's, and she has a son who has been autistic his whole life. Interacting with him you know they are real people, they interact normally. They have their moments, but they can do good in society and in the world. It's not something that they should be looked down upon, or shunned, or turn a cold shoulder."
Anderson welcomes the opportunity to be an advocate for those with autism, whether it's through his cleats or just in daily life. He knows they are the same as him, people who can lead a normal life, but just might have some obstacles to overcome as they do.
"They can be way smarter than most of us," said Anderson. "I went to school with someone who had autism and he was way smarter than all of us. You could have jar of marbles, and he could just look at it and tell you the number of marbles in the jar and he would be right. You would be, like, wow. You just have to work with some of them socially.
"I just want to raise awareness that people with autism shouldn't be treated any differently."
Keeanu Benton Cause: United Cerebral Palsy
When friends become family, you want to do everything you can to help them.
And that is the case for Keeanu Benton and his cleats.
Benton is supporting United Cerebral Palsy with his cleats, a motor disability that affects a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture.
"My best friend's brother has cerebral palsy," said Benton, referring to Sam Coulter who has lived with the disorder most of his life. "That is like my second family. I moved in with them my junior year of high school. I got a different perspective of disabilities and what they mean.
"He has such an impact on my life and it means a lot to me to wear him on my shoes and go out there and play with him right there."
Benton said living with the family opened his eyes to how people with disabilities are viewed and in many cases, he wants to change that view.
"Growing up, I felt like disabilities got treated in a bad manner," said Benton. "But it's just a part of what makes that person who they are. He has cerebral palsy and some seizure disorders, but being around him and seeing his personality, what he loves, what he lights up about. He is verbal but he isn't on the level he should be at 32 years old.
"He has an impact on my life and that is why I want to do this."
Beanie Bishop Jr. Cause: WVU Medicine Children's Hospital
Helping kids is something that is near and dear to rookie nickelback Beanie Bishop Jr., so it was easy for him to choose a cause for his cleats.
Biship wanted to do the WVU Medicine Children's Hospital to bring attention to the great work being done there and the happiness you can bring to a child's day with a simple visit or kind gesture.
"Just seeing those kids is what it's about," said Bishop. "Some of them, they don't know when they're going home, if they're going home at all. Being able to kind of build relationships with those kids and see the joy and be able to cause joy in their life, even if it's for 30 minutes or whatever, it's something I enjoy. I just want to do what I can and just try to be that little beam of light."
Bishop visited the hospital multiple times while he played one season at West Virginia University, and since signing with the Steelers he has also made a visit to UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
He has a soft spot for the kids, knowing that it's the little things that mean the most.
"Here in Pittsburgh, I had the chance to go visit the kids at Children's Hospital," said Bishop. "It's the same thing I did in West Virginia. I went there a few times throughout the season and offseason, just spending time with some of those kids."
One thing it taught Bishop was to count his blessings and realize how good he has it.
"It's all about trying to put a smile on those kids face, to make their day," said Bishop. "Even if it's only for a short amount of time, just being able to do that and see those kids smile is special.
"It helps me a lot as well. Those kids don't know what they have and whatever's going on. And I don't ever ask about it.
"I have nothing to complain about, especially going to see those kids. It makes you look at life a little bit differently."
Dylan Cook Cause: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Project
Home is where the heart is, and when people in your home area are impacted by something, you want to help.
That is why Dylan Cook is wearing his cleats to help bring attention to a segment of the population that is oftentimes forgotten through the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Project.
Cook is from Butte, Montana, where the Native American population is part of the community. And it's a community that is disproportionately being impacted by issues such as human trafficking.
"It's such a prominent issue in Montana," said Cook. "It's an issue that's close to home. I feel like it doesn't get the recognition it should. We all talk about human trafficking and all that, but I feel like that demographic, indigenous people, are the main demographic of what's going on. I feel like the least I could do is use my platform to raise some money for them."
And it's about more than that. It's about bringing attention to their plight, the battle they are facing without many even knowing it's happening.
"In Montana, we have around seven reservations and people's lack of knowledge on it is just so prevalent," said Cook. "People just worry about themselves and look the other way and it's crazy. You could ask anyone in Montana, and they personally have been impacted by it in some sort of way, whether they know somebody or a family member or something.
"I just want to bring awareness to it because I feel like not a lot of other people are."
Cook's hope is with the NFL allowing him and others to share their causes, it might bring the attention that makes a difference.
"It's incredible. It's so awesome," said Cook. "It's such an awesome opportunity for the organizations that we choose to get themselves out there and get some publicity. It's awesome."
Zach Frazier Cause: UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
About a month ago, when the Steelers rookie class made a visit to UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, center Zach Frazier was unable to go because he was just coming off an ankle injury and wasn't able to walk around comfortably.
He was disappointed he couldn't do it, but knew he wanted to do something to make up for it when the time arose.
That is why Frazier chose the hospital to support with his cleats.
Frazier visited VWU Medicine Children's Hospital when he played for the Mountaineers, something he always enjoyed, so he wanted to pay it forward in Pittsburgh.
"In college, one of my favorite things to do was go and visit the local children's hospital in West Virginia," said Frazier. "I haven't had the opportunity to go to the one here in Pittsburgh yet, but I want to."
Frazier said he draws inspiration from the kids, knowing that any battle he has had to face, they have it so much harder and they never complain.
"You see what they are going through and it makes you realize that what you are doing isn't hard," said Frazier. "It gives you a lot of perspective. If I can do anything to help them have a little bit of a better day, I will do it.
"Anything I can do to bring awareness, help them out anyway, that is what I am doing.
"It's really cool the NFL provides this opportunity. Coming from college we never had anything like this. Them allowing us to do this, it makes it special."
Pat Freiermuth Cause: Reid's Rebels
When Paula Garrant first learned that Pat Freiermuth was wearing his cleats to support Reid's Rebels, a foundation set up to honor her late son Reid Garrant, her heart exploded.
"It means everything. In one word, everything," said Garrant. "I am going to cry."
She paused for a few minutes, too choked up to talk.
After composing herself, she continued to talk about her son Reid, who passed away in 2018 of leukemia at just 22-years old.
"It's pretty big," said Garrant. "I miss my son. It happened so quickly when the whole leukemia thing happened. It was 16 hours from the time he was diagnosed until he died. It was crazy.
"My son Reid played with Pat and his brother, Timmy. My son was a senior when Pat was a freshman. We are from the same hometown, the same school. It just means so much."
Freiermuth said he wanted to bring attention to Garrant and the foundation, hoping to help others battling the same disease, so he is wearing cleats to support them once again.
"It means a lot," said Freiermuth. "Just being able to wear those cleats and put recognition to that foundation. Reid's mom has worked so hard to get her son's name out there. Being able to help in that process on a national stage like that is awesome.
"It is cool. The more eyes on the cleats, the better. That is what really helps the cause."
One of the things that touches Garrant's heart the most is that Reid was a Steelers fan his entire life and would have been overjoyed that Freiermuth was drafted by them.
"Reid's favorite team from the time he was born, he had no choice because of his dad, was the Steelers," said Garrant. "He came out in black and gold. Pat doing this not only for his teammates, friends, family, our community and Reid's organization, it means so much.
"When he was drafted by the Steelers, it was a divine intervention. It means so much to me. This is like a dream. Unfortunately, my son is not physically here, but I feel like spiritually he is going to be with us that day and see Pat with those cleats on fighting for kids with leukemia."
Nick Herbig Cause: HerbieGives
Nick Herbig was challenged when he was in college at the University of Wisconsin by his professor, award-winning instructor Don Stanley, to do a project for his media marketing class.
It was from that project that Herbig came up with the idea for HerbieGives, something that started as a social media project that has turned into a non-profit along with his brother, Steelers center Nate Herbig, in Kaua'i, Hawaii.
The purpose is to uplift student-athletes in Hawaii and transform lives through education and sports. And he is proud to share their cause on his cleats this year.
"It started in college because I had a class with Don Stanley, a media marketing class," said Herbig. "We had to come up with a plan to market a foundation or a charitable cause.
"I always wanted to do something for back home, so I started the project as a way I can give back to my community. It started off as me just like posting stuff on an Instagram page I made. I was giving out information, because where we're from in Hawaii, there isn't a lot of information about getting to that next level. I was just trying to educate them with what camps you should be going to, how to go about your SAT's, all of that.
"That's how it started. And then it caught traction and turned into something bigger. When my brother and I went home last year, we got a chance to do a football camp. So that kind of blew it up even more.
"It keeps gaining more traction and it's something that I can be proud of."
For Herbig, giving back to where he is from is something that touches his heart and makes him beyond proud.
"The thing I've been blessed with throughout my journey, my career, is I wouldn't be here by myself," said Herbig. "There's a lot of people who gave to me and sacrificed for me and gave me opportunities that I wouldn't have had if I was by myself. So just being able to give back, even if I can just change one kid's life, that means the world to me."
Cameron Heyward Cause: The Heyward House
One of the ugliest words Cameron Heyward will ever hear is cancer.
It's a word that rocked his world, when he was a teenager, and his father, Craig "Ironhead" Heyward, died of brain cancer.
His father died when he was just 16-years old, the summer before his senior year of high school. Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, who played at the University of Pittsburgh and in the NFL, had to give up football in 1999 because of a tumor that impacted his vision in the right eye. They thought that was the end of things, but it wasn't. He suffered a stroke, becoming paralyzed on the right side.
"He was working to walk for my senior night," Heyward shared. "Before that happened, the summer before my senior year, he ended up passing away while I was at a basketball camp. My mom had to be the one to tell me. I remember that day clearly, looking for my mom, not knowing what was happening. I could feel everybody was being very delicate with me. When I found my mom, she had to share that with me. I know that was hard for her to share. I understood the strength she showed. From that moment, I got to see the strength she showed after that."
Heyward has made cancer awareness a passion for him through his foundation, as the reigning Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year has done event after event over the years to keep his father's memory in the forefront, while honoring all who have fought or lost their battle.
And he is continuing that by representing The Heyward House and cancer awareness with his cleats.
"Every year that goes by, this is just a great opportunity to raise money and awareness towards cancer," said Heyward. "Whether it's kids or adults, it's everybody. It's something that everybody's got to deal with.
"Usually everybody knows somebody who is dealing with it hard to deal with because it affects our loved ones.
"Doing this, bringing attention to them, it doesn't bring back the person you lost, but hopefully can help one another person."
Alex Highsmith Cause: Highsmith Family Foundation and International Justice Mission
For Alex Highsmith, giving back is something that comes naturally to him, a reflection of the way he was raised. So, when it came to deciding on his cleats, he knew he wanted to spread the awareness around, not just focusing on one area, but two.
He is representing the Highsmith Family Foundation and the Internation Justice Mission (IJM) with his cleats, two causes that touch his heart deeply.
The Highsmith Family Foundation does work in the Pittsburgh area, as well as his hometown and college towns of Wilmington and Charlotte, North Carolina.
"Our mission is to give back and to impact the youth in those areas," said Highsmith. "I know how important it is to invest in the next generation in so many different ways. And so that's just something that's important to me."
Highsmith has hosted multiple back to school events through his foundation and has also helped those in the community who are struggling, including the homeless.
"Ultimately, I know that I can make a lasting difference in the community," said Highsmith. "Just by going out and doing different things with the kids and being a role model for them, that's what matters to me most."
Highsmith has also been involved with bringing attention to IJM, a global organization that protects people in poverty from violence. They partner with local authorities in 16 countries to combat trafficking and slavery, violence against women and children and police abuse of power.
"This is an important issue today that's not talked about enough," said Highsmith. "I wore my cleats for them last year and I wanted to do it again just because I think it's important to continue to raise awareness. It's still going on and something that still needs to be talked about."
Miles Killebrew Cause: Café Momentum
As a member of the Steelers Social Justice Committee, special teams captain Miles Killebrew has taken the time to truly learn about organizations in the Pittsburgh area that are trying to make a difference in the lives of at-risk youth.
One such organization is Café Momentum, something that sounds like a great place to grab a meal, but it's so much more.
"I decided to partner with them this year just because I'm a huge believer in what they're doing. I'm a big fan of their work in the community. We are a community partner with them already. I just wanted to double down on that and just kind of reinforce my stance on being supportive of them.
Café Momentum Pittsburgh opened in 2023 as a place where Pittsburghers can go and enjoy fine dining.
More than that, it offers a culinary internship to teens 15 to 19 who are justice-involved. Café Momentum, which originated in Dallas, provides a transformative experience through a 12-month paid post-release internship program. Participants rotate through the restaurant, focusing on life and social skills, coaching and development.
Their mission is to transform young lives by equipping Pittsburgh's justice-involved youth with life skills, education and employment opportunities to help them achieve their full potential.
"I actually was at the downtown location recently and we were able to just talk," said Killebrew. "I was able to meet with one of the interns. And it was a really great time. I presented him, Nico was his name, with a pair of cleats just for him. So, it was a cool moment.
"I'm really excited about the work that they're doing in Pittsburgh and fully stand behind them 100 percent."
What Killebrew appreciates is the organization is giving kids a chance, kids who were impacted in some way or another through the justice system.
"I find in a lot of cases, these youth, they just need someone to believe in them and to offer them an alternative," said Killebrew. "That's what they're doing there. And it's needed.
"I am just really proud to be associated with such a strong organization."
Christian Kuntz Cause: Kuntz 4 Ki6s Foundation
Christian Kuntz is Pittsburgh through and through, so it comes as no surprise that his foundation, Kuntz 4 Ki6s Foundation, supports youth in the Pittsburgh area in multiple ways.
Kuntz main focus for the foundation is youth sports, himself growing up in the Pittsburgh sports scene from youth football, through high school, college and now in the NFL.
"My focus is to provide for the youth in Pittsburgh, whether that's the Boys & Girls Club in Pittsburgh, my own football camp, other players football camps," said Kuntz. "I want to raise money, give back to the youth, make their football playing experience better."
While that is the main focus, he isn't limiting himself.
"If kids are hungry, I want to help out in that area," said Kuntz. "Whatever I can do to help the youth in this area, I will."
Kuntz held his first ever youth football camp this past summer, and also partnered on a Pittsburgh themed pickleball paddle to benefit the foundation and held a golf outing.
"My golf outing and youth camp this year, I saw the difference I can make, the people that get behind it to help raise money for it," said Kuntz. "It's awesome. It's special.
"People messaged me because I also helped raise money for Cystic Fibrosis this offseason, and people will tell me their child has CF and what it meant to them. It's moments like that, messages like that, that makes it all worth it."
With the foundation still rather new, Kuntz loves the opportunity to bring attention to it through his cleats.
"That is going to be cool, especially because it's my own foundation and something I am proud of," said Kuntz. "Every guy that is out there wearing their cleats has a special place in their heart for why they are wearing their cleats and it's all for a good reason."
Logan Lee Cause: Athletes in Action
Logan Lee has a long connection with Athletes in Action, which includes taking part in a service trip to Ecuador through Iowa's Athletes in Action when he was a student-athlete there.
Lee, along with more than a dozen other athletes, distributed water filters to 86 families without access to clean water.
"In the villages, they had running water, but it was like muddy, muddy water," said Lee at the time. "Many of the people just drank straight from it."
It was that trip, and many other moments with Athletes in Action, that made his decision to support them with his cleats an easy one.
"I've been impacted by them in so many ways," said Lee. "I've been blessed in my life, and I want to share the initiative and help bring words to those in Athletes in Action who have helped me grow so much in my faith.
"I was a leader at Iowa's Athletes in Action for three years and they have a couple of camps that they run called the Ultimate Training Camp. Those have really helped me grow in my faith, allowed me to really just develop, develop my faith on a more intimate level and allow me to help apply faith to my sport while I'm participating.
"Not just praying before, not just praying after, but during the midst of competition, trying to stay with the Lord and make that a priority.
"The biggest thing is I've always had a great relationship with Christ. But by making that the number one priority and involving him in every area of my life, not making him just a subsector piece of my life, but involvement in everything I do."
Lee is thankful the NFL allows players to represent causes that are near and dear to them, not for their own benefit, but to bring rightful attention to worthwhile endeavors.
"It's awesome," said Lee. "It's pretty neat being able to see so many guys find a nonprofit that has either helped them or that they feel passionate about and being able to help share that. Share that with people so that they can help grow these great organizations that have helped so many people around the world. It's just pretty neat."
Isaiahh Loudermilk Cause: Cancer Bridges
Whenever the opportunity arises to honor those who are breast cancer survivors, Isaiahh Loudermilk is right there.
Loudermilk has taken part in a UPMC Heathy Cooking Demo for breast cancer patients and proudly wears the Crucial Catch Steelers merchandise.
This year, he is wearing his cleats to support Cancer Bridges, an organization that supports cancer patients, including those battling breast cancer.
And the reason for his devotion to the cause is simple.
His mother, Stacy Howell, is a breast cancer survivor.
"I am blessed because she is all cured from it now," said Loudermilk. "She was diagnosed when I was a sophomore in high school. Those next few years were kind of rough. It's something I want to bring attention to. It's something that is near and dear to me.
"It means a lot to me because I have gone through that with my mom. I am super close to her. I know she was struggling when she went through it. I know because I was in high school, she tried to keep that from me and the rest of my siblings. I pay attention to things, and I saw how much she was struggling with it. For me to be able to go out and do things to help support this cause means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to her too."
While she was going through her battle, her love and support for her son never faltered, always there for him for football, school events, and anything else he needed.
"Even when she was going through treatment, she was always there to support me," said Loudermilk. "I finished high school and went off to college and she was still going through that, but the biggest supporter of me. Anything I can do to support her, I am going to do it any chance I get."
Loudermilk knew his mom tried to hide as much of what she was going through from him to protect him, but he could see how difficult it was, even though she showed tremendous strength through her battle.
"She is one of the strongest people I know," said Loudermilk. "Of course, she was scared, she was sad about it. She never showed that to me. That helped me get through it. I knew she was strong through it. I can't even imagine being in that position and being as strong as she was."
When it was time to leave for college at the University of Wisconsin, Loudermilk was happy his mom was close to the end of her treatment, but it still wasn't easy.
"It was tough," said Loudermilk. "It was toward the end of her treatment when I left for college and things were looking good. But it was still tough to leave, knowing she was struggling back at home with something like that. When I first went to school, I called her every day. We talked every day. I was still there for her, still trying to help her.
"At the same time, she was there to help me because she knows how I am. I am a momma's boy. Being away from home was hard. We helped each other through it. I know she helped me, and I hope I was able to help her."
Tyler Matakevich Cause: Show Your Soft Side
Tyler Matakevich had no intention of getting a puppy when he went to do a photo shoot for Show Your Soft Side, a public service campaign that was created to change the mindset of young people who 'view the maiming and torturing of defenseless cats and dogs as a sign of toughness.'
The organization helps find homes for dogs and cats who are considered 'rescue' pets, those abandoned or taken from abusive situations.
As soon as the Labrador puppy sat on his lap, his softer side came out and he was a goner.
"It was like they set me up," laughed Matakevich. "I had to take her home."
Matakevich is wearing his cleats to support Show Your Soft Side, an organization he got involved with through the family of a former Temple University teammate. She asked him to do the photo shoot, and he was more than happy to oblige.
"I walked into the room and there were about five or six puppies, all black labs," said Matakevich. "They gave me one. Within 10 minutes she just fell asleep right in my arms. I was like, wow you set me up. I can't give her back. That happened on a Friday, my girlfriend picked her up on Saturday and I had her on a Sunday."
That was several years ago, and Bailey is part of Matakevich's life, and he wouldn't want it any other way.
"Just being around them and realizing they don't have a place to go," said Matakevich. "I wish I would have taken them all. I donate now to their fundraisers. They keep me updated on everything they have going on. You just feel so good knowing you are helping a good cause and giving these dogs a good home. If I do it again, I won't leave empty handed."
Ryan McCollum Cause: Wounded Warriors Project
Center Ryan McCollum has a strong appreciation for those who have served our country in the military, and continue to serve, especially with both of his grandfathers among the numerous members of his family who have served, and several cousins who are active duty.
That is why he chose Wounded Warrior Project to support on his cleats, an organization he feels good about in the way they help veterans.
"I just think it's a good organization," said McCollum. "They have a good mission. I believe in what they stand for and what they do. So, if there's any way that I could help them out, I would love to. I think it's really important that we take care of our veterans.
"I texted my cousin (who is active duty) about it and he agreed with me. He told me that he thought that was a really good one. So that's why I decided to go with them."
Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) began in 2003 as a small, grassroots effort providing simple care and comfort items to wounded service members returning home from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
It has evolved tremendously, to programs such as mental health, career counseling, and long-term rehabilitative care, along with advocacy efforts to improve the lives of warriors and their families.
One of the aspects McCollum likes about the way Wounded Warriors takes care of veterans is they do address the mental health side, as well as the physical well-being of the veteran.
"People don't ask others how are you doing," said McCollum. "They just ask physically how are you doing, not mentally. I think it's really important to check on those people and give them the services they need and the care they need and just being an ear for them to talk to."
Mason McCormick Cause: UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
When guard Mason McCormick recently spent time visiting patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh with his fellow rookies, something touched him.
It touched him so much, that McCormick decided to represent the hospital with his cleats, giving something back to kids who fight so hard.
"Going to see those kids really had an impact on me," said McCormick. "We like to think that we go there and have an impact on them. But it definitely impacted me. It was a super cool experience. And I look forward to going back there when I can."
McCormick said the visit made him stop and think about the little things that sometimes bother him, and realize they are just that, little things.
"It puts things into perspective," said McCormick. "Just seeing them so happy and living in the moment even with the adversity that they have.
"It's pretty cool to see them smiling.
"It definitely provides some perspective on life and just living in the moment and enjoying each day. It's super cool to be able to support a group like this. It's awesome."
Larry Ogunjobi Cause: American Heart Association/Childhood Obesity
Larry Ogunjobi is reaching back to his childhood in support of his cleats, wanting to make sure the message he delivers about how he grew up can be a lesson for kids today.
Ogunjobi is supporting the American Heart Association and childhood obesity, something he admits he dealt with as a kid.
"I was obese when I was growing up," said Ogunjobi. "I didn't start playing football until my sophomore year in high school. I was about 350 pounds. I understand the struggles for kids that are overweight. I know football changed my life. So being able to highlight a cause that changed my life for the better is very important to me."
Ogunjobi was more interested in playing video games than football growing up, but that all changed when he got a push to sign up for the Ragsdale High football team in Jamestown, North Carolina.
Ogunjobi put his mind to getting in shape to make the team, and he did just that.
"I had a coach my sophomore year of high school," said Ogunjobi. "My dad met him at the park, and he wanted to help. I didn't really know anything about football or anything like that, but he just wanted to help me lose weight.
"He trained me for about a month or so and one day we were driving by the high school, and he said you are going to play football. I said, no, I'm not. He said yes, you are. We got into an argument. He took me to the front office, got the permission slip and my mom signed it.
"I was on the football field that Saturday. When I finished the workout, I couldn't finish the sprints. And that was the end of practice. The next day they came up to me and said, Larry, are you still here. I said, yes, I am still here. In my head I was thinking because I have to be.
"I went through my junior varsity season and got the award for most improved JV player. And I went from 350 the summer of my sophomore year to 247 the summer of my junior year. I lost around 100 pounds in a year."
Knowing that it took an awakening for him to develop from the kid who had no interest in playing sports and would rather sit around playing video games, to the professional athlete he is today, has inspired Ogunjobi to do his part to help kids.
He holds an annual football camp at his high school, encouraging kids to get out and be active and give it a shot.
"I understand that it's important to be active and not live a sedentary life, be able to move around," said Ogunjobi. "Get out there and do things you enjoy doing. Find the things you like, the things you don't like, and do the things you like. Expose yourself to things.
"I was a kid that just liked to play video games, I didn't do anything else. Then I was introduced to football, and it became my life. I want to be an outlet and light for kids who might not know where they want to go and show them that it's possible for them too.
"Just give it a chance. Step out of your comfort zone. You might end up liking it more than you thought you would."
Ayo Oyelola Cause: Lives not Knives
For defensive back Ayo Oyelola, choosing his cause for his cleats was easy because of what is happening as of late in his home of London, England.
Violence with knives has become way too commonplace, and Oyelola has aligned with Lives not Knives, a youth-led organization that is working to prevent knife crime, serious youth violence and anti-social behavior.
"I worked with them before and I want to do more for them," said Oyelola. "There is a knife crime epidemic in London. It's a pretty big deal.
"In 2023, I went back to London, and I did an event with them. It was about raising awareness about it. We talked about why you don't have to carry a knife, why it's not necessary.
"I'm just trying to impact the community I grew up in because I've been impacted by knife crime personally. I have friends who have been impacted by it. It hits home, so it's pretty important to me.
"It means everything to do this. I think I'm very fortunate to be where I am and I want to use the little platform I have in the best way I can."
Oyelola has visited schools in the London area to share the message, handing out merchandise to the kids and hosting flag football.
"We taught the kids about the sport, engaged with them," said Oyelola. "Then we did a Q & A with the kids where they could ask questions and learn more, help them. It was really fun, and I think everyone enjoyed it,"
Cordarrelle Patterson Cause: Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness
For Cordarrelle Patterson, his cause is personal, and one that is painful.
He is supporting pregnancy and infant loss awareness, after he and his wife, Taylor, lost their son, Zyan, in 2017 when she was 18 to 20 weeks into her pregnancy.
It's a loss that never goes away for a parent, one that little things can remind you of on a daily basis.
But Patterson wants to express that loss, that pain, to help others and let them know they aren't alone if they experience a similar loss.
"Me and my wife, we lost a baby," said Patterson. "Ever since then, that's just been something in our heart. So, I just want to pay a lot of respect to those people out there that lost a baby because a lot of women can't have babies, and sometimes they lose them, and that's the only opportunity they can have to have a baby.
"I'm just thankful and blessed my wife was able to have more kids after that. It's just an honor and blessing that happened for us. I'm just trying to give respect back to all those people that lost babies."
Patterson has been wearing cleats to bring attention to the matter for as long as he can remember, to keep his son's memory alive and to help others who are suffering.
"It touched us in a special way," said Patterson. "Every year we do it and we get a lot of good feedback from people who reach out to us, and they've been through the same experience. I just feel bad for a lot of those mothers out there that lose their kids."
Bringing hope to others is something Patterson hopes he can do, as he has been able to grow his family since the heartbreak they went through.
"It really is more common than people know," said Patterson. "Me as a guy, we really don't even hold that burden on this because we don't go through that same type of feeling a woman goes through. But as a man, you've just got to be there for your love, for your girl or whoever it is, and just try to be there as much as you can. You show her respect.
"It can happen to anybody. Just praying to God that it doesn't happen to a lot of people. We try to be thankful and count our blessings. We know God put us in the situation we can get through."
James Pierre Cause: Glimmer of Hope Foundation
James Pierre has a soft spot in his heart for those battling cancer. He knows the fight they are going through is real, that it's painful for them and those around them. And he knows people are fighting the battle at a younger and younger age.
Pierre is using his cleats to represent a Glimmer of Hope Foundation, a Pittsburgh organization that aim is to provide services, programs, research, and technology that prevents breast cancer from advancing.
The research aspect is something that stuck out in Pierre's mind, as Glimmer of Hope is at the forefront of some of the most advanced breast cancer research in the country.
"I want to make an impact on different types of people," said Pierre. "I did my research, and what they do is great research to help people, to help prevent people from getting cancer and to help people who are battling cancer. I just wanted to do something to help them."
Early detection is a battle cry for many organizations involved in the fight against cancer, and Glimmer of Hope is no different as the disease is hitting women at early ages.
"People need to understand what can happen to their body not just when they get older, but now too," said Pierre. "It's important to always know what is going on with ourselves, to be on top of things. Hopefully bringing attention helps even one person."
Pierre is grateful for the opportunity to share Glimmer of Hope's mission on his cleats, knowing the impact it can have is far reaching.
"Everything in the NFL is a privilege," said Pierre. "Just being here, all the resources we have to connect with other people. If we can all come together and do something and bring more attention to this, we have to do it."
Joey Porter Jr. Cause: Jasmine Nyree Day Center/Campus
There aren't many young football players that know what life after football is going to entail for them, but there also aren't many who have committed so much of themselves to a special cause as cornerback Joey Porter Jr.
Along with the rest of his family, he has given his heart and soul to the Jasmine Nyree Day Center in Pittsburgh and Bakersfield, California, a campus that truly is a beacon of hope for adults with developmental issues. Among those who have benefited from the center is Porter's older sister, Jasmine, or 'Jazzy' as she is known to those who love her, who was diagnosed with autism as a very young child.
Because of her autism, Jazzy is non-verbal and requires continuous care. And that is where the Jasmine Nyree Center came into play.
It started in Porter's hometown of Bakersfield, California, and eventually Pittsburgh, after his mother, Christy Porter, learned there were families that weren't able to secure care for their kids or adult children because of lack of insurance and resources. She worked endlessly to open three centers in Bakersfield, encompassing different age groups and then the Jasmine Nyree Campus in Pittsburgh, where the Porters have settled.
"I am super proud of my mom, the determination to do what she did and continues to do it, it's super hard," said Porter. "Just going without having guidance and still making it. The fact that she was able to do it in Pittsburgh was a big plus for her. She doesn't get enough credit for it."
Porter majored in rehabilitation and human services at Penn State University, with the plan to take over management of the center one day because of his passion for helping those like his sister.
"I planned my college education based on what I want to do later in life, which everyone should do," said Porter. "It was tough, the classes were hard, but I had a purpose behind it, so it gave me more of a reason to finish it.
"We have been doing this for so long, since I was young. Now that I am growing into a role where later in life, I am going to take over the business and do what my mom and dad did just at a higher level. It's been an amazing process. To be a part of it step by step has been great."
For now, though, his passion is simply being there for his sister.
"I love her," said Porter. "It's that unconditional love. That is something my family has with her. We can tell her we love her, but she can never tell us she loves us. But we know she does.
"She is also a big football fan. Any time she gets to see me play, she loves it. She is smiling. It's great to put on for her.
"Even though I am the little brother, I am the big brother. I am very protective of my sister. That is how I am with all of my family. We are super protective of each other and love each other dearly."
Porter went through a brief time as a kid when it was hard to understand what his sister was dealing with, and he is hoping by wearing his cleats and speaking out he can bring more attention to what those who have autism deal with and are capable of.
"My mom and dad did such a great job of explaining it all to us, and coaching us through the process," said Porter. "It wasn't that difficult for us. We love her no matter what, never a doubt about it. Whatever issues we have in the journey, we face it."
Patrick Queen Cause: TAPS and Military Appreciation
Patrick Queen has a deep respect for those who serve our country. It's something that is inside of him, something that has grown, especially when he sees others not share that same level of respect.
That is why he simply wants to show his support of veterans on his cleats, an overall show of respect for the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country, as well as TAPS. TAPS is the national nonprofit organization providing compassionate care and comprehensive resources to all those grieving a death in the military or veteran community.
"Just recently, with social media becoming more of a platform for things that take place, you get to see stuff and see how they're treated," said Queen. "All the stuff they went through in the past, and then them coming back home and the stuff they go through. I feel like we don't take care of them enough.
"I feel like there are way more opportunities out there for us to be able to help those guys out when they come back, having places for them and better ways to help them transition away from that type of life that they had to live.
"And just to say thank you. So, my little appreciation with the cleats, there is way more we can do, but it's just a little token of appreciation."
Queen understands that he has the privilege of playing a game he loves because of the freedom we have in this country, which is provided by the sacrifices of those who have served.
"This is the best country in the world," said Queen. "The freedom that we have, all of the stuff that we get to do that not most countries get to do and stuff. This is just a little token of appreciation."
Elandon Roberts Cause: Healthy Start
Elandon Roberts chose an organization that touches his heart with Healthy Start.
Healthy Start's mission is to improve Black maternal and child health and to reduce poor birth outcomes and infant mortality in Allegheny County.
Roberts and his wife, Tori, are parents of three children, so they understand the importance of a healthy start for the mother and child. Healthy Start provides home visits, prenatal education, and mental health programs, among many other services for families.
"Because me and my wife, through the process of the birth for our kids, we choose to home birth for two of them, the midwife route, just because of the way some of my wife's appointments went," said Roberts. "She was a little uncomfortable. So we started doing our at home birth and because of how successful our home births were and how comfortable my wife was, it gave us that opportunity that we wanted to give back to other upcoming mothers, giving them an opportunity to enjoy healthy delivery."
Roberts also hosted a baby shower for expectant moms who are part of the program at Hosanna House, which included gifts, educational programs, kids activities and more.
"The work that Healthy Start does is important to me because me and my wife did research, and we noticed in Allegheny County, there are more Black women passing away from births or discovering defects at birth," said Roberts. "We wanted to make sure that we set our platform that we were able to help and put another hand in a pot to help out with this cause.
"I just want to support them any way that I can. We want to be involved and help out any way we can."
Darnell Washington Cause: Military Appreciation
Darnell Washington has a soft spot in his heart for those who have, and continue to, serve in the United States military.
And it's easy to understand why.
Washington's older brother, Ezekiel, is a United States Marine.
Washington, who is one of seven kids in his family, spent time in foster care when he was younger, separated from some of his siblings, with the exception of Ezekiel. It was his older brother who helped to guide him and shape his life.
"He's the one who showed me the ropes and helped me be on the path I have today," said Washington. "He showed me a lot. I learned a lot from him. He was always the big brother who kept me on track, told me don't hang out with that crowd or make sure to lock in on things. He always kept me on the right path. I'm thankful for that.
"I also thank him for his service. I just want to thank everybody who served or is serving currently for what they do every day to protect us. They're the ones who protect our country."
Washington said he was aware before he even got into the NFL what the league and players did to honor the military, and he is thrilled to be a part of that legacy with his cleats.
"In college, or even before college, I would see the NFL teams partnering with the military. Now I'm in the NFL and appreciate what I can do and do my part to say thank you."
T.J. Watt Cause: UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
For T.J. Watt, nothing brings him more pleasure than causing havoc for opposing quarterbacks on the field.
But, there is a completely different side to Watt. A side that is on display when he visits the patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
Watt loves visiting the hospital, along with his wife Dani, every opportunity they get. He enjoys the time he spends with the patients, innocent kids who are sometimes fighting for their lives, but still happy as can be.
That is why Watt is supporting the hospital with his cleats, something that means the world to him as he and Dani are expecting their first child.
"With having a baby on the way, it just really puts things into perspective," said Watt. "Those kids don't pick the hand that they were dealt and those families, because it's more than just the kids, it's the support system that they have.
"My mission just really aligns with the mission that they have over at Children's Hospital, to provide everything they possibly can for those kids and their families. And every time I go there, I leave inspired."
Watt gets pure joy out of the visits, getting as much out of them as the kids do.
"The smiles is what I love," said Watt. "They help me forget about my life more than I feel like I help them forget about their life. And it's so special to just see the impact that we have on the community. I think it's so important for us to do things like visiting Children's Hospital because you get so cooped up in life and going to the facility, going home, repeating that. You don't realize the impact you have on the community until you go to a children's hospital and see kids' faces lighting up when you just want to have a conversation."
And when Watt does stop by the hospital to visit, not much is heard about it. And that's just the way he wants it to be.
"It's not about social media and letting everybody know what you're doing," said Watt. "I think it's more of an intimate setting when you don't have all the cameras, and it allows the kids to open up and be more comfortable around you. I think it's important to let the kids know that I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm not doing it for the cameras. I'm just doing it because I truly want to get to know them. I want to let the families know that I'm with them. I'm thinking about them, caring about them. And it's so fun to go with my wife and just to be able to have that experience.
"Whenever we can, I love to get over to the hospital. They do so many great things for the kids, whether it's the Dream Studio that they have there, or when we picked Halloween costumes with the kids. There are fun Thanksgiving and Christmas activities they do, and other things to help keep the kids minds off of the extreme procedures that they go through that make them heroes."
Payton Wilson Cause: Convoy of Hope
When Payton Wilson saw what was happening in Western North Carolina during Hurricane Helene, it truly bothered the Steelers rookie linebacker.
Wilson, who is from Hillsborough, North Carolina and played at North Carolina State, knows people who live in the area and was devastated to see the damage that took place.
He wants to help the people in the area, wants to bring attention to the suffering they are still going through, the damage that is still there even if it's out of the headlines.
Wilson is teaming up with Convoy of Hope for his cleats, an organization that during natural and humanitarian disaster, responds with tangible aid and compassion. Convoy of Hope provides disaster relief, aiding those who are struggling with the bare necessities such as food, clean water, hygiene items, and more. They also provide long-term assistance, when possible, to help people rebuild and recover.
"I want to do something to help Western North Carolina," said Wilson. "Obviously, it's not on the news anymore as much, but it's still tough out in Western North Carolina. So just trying to bring as much as much notoriety and publicity to the area as I possibly can.
"The work that they do. It's an amazing organization and I'm just excited to help in some way."
Wilson said it's tough to know some people still don't have all the basics yet, but he also understands it takes time to rebuild. He has faith, though, that they will.
"I don't think that people truly understand what Western North Carolina is like," said Wilson. "It's similar to here in Pittsburgh almost. It's in the mountains, but it's a little smaller. The hurricane wiped out some of those small towns. People are still struggling. It's still tough out there. So, I'm just trying to bring as much publicity as I can because it feels like the news just kind of forgot about it."
Russell Wilson Cause: Why Not You Foundation and V Foundation
Quarterback Russell Wilson is wearing his cleats this week to support his Why Not You Foundation as well as the V Foundation for Cancer Research.
Wilson started the Why Not You Foundation in 2014 to support education, children's health, fighting poverty, and empowering today's youth to lead with a why not you attitude. The mission is to empower change in the world, one individual at a time, and one child at a time.
"What I have learned is that to whom much is given, much is required," said Wilson. "I believe that.
"The NFL does a great job of allowing us players to really focus on the things that matter to us. For me and Ciara and our foundation, the Why Not You Foundation, we built it so we can focus on the youth.
"My dad and mom, and her parents too, instilled a why don't you attitude in us. We didn't come from much. We were young kids that had big dreams, and they worked their tails off to give us a chance and opportunity.
"That's the why not you attitude that's been instilled.
"We've been fortunate to be able help with childhood cancer, homelessness, food insecurities and education as well. We're really excited about the opportunity to obviously have an impact here in Pittsburgh and continue across the country."
Wilson has already made an impact in the Pittsburgh community with his work through the foundation, including donating $50,000 to the Boys & Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania.
The foundation has raised over $15 million for youth education and health organizations, helping countless individuals and making a difference in so many lives.
The Why Not You Foundation has also partnered with the V Foundation for Cancer Research, started by late North Carolina State basketball coach, Jim Valvano. Wilson is planning a future event with the foundation, and his cleats will represent both foundations.
"I'm excited because our Why Not You Foundation is also partnering up with the V Foundation," said Wilson. "We're on the board for the V Foundation, me and Ciara, and we've done some really cool things together and we're going to have an event in the spring to help raise funds for Why Not You Foundation and also the V Foundation.
"We're really excited about that and our continued partnership and relationship with the V Foundation. So the Why Not You Foundation and the V Foundation are partnering together and that's what I'm doing my cleats for."

5 for Friday: Boswell has had remarkable season
T.J. Watt was voted the Steelers' MVP earlier this week by his teammates. And for good reason.
But nobody would have batted an eye had the team voted for placekicker Chris Boswell to win the award.
Boswell has posted a league-best 153 points through the first 16 games, breaking his own team record of 142 set in 2017 when he led the NFL. His point total is the 12th-most in NFL history behind David Akers' NFL record of 166 set in 2011.
His 40 made field goals this season also broke his own team record of 36 set in 2021 and are second-most in NFL history behind Akers' 44 in that 2011 season.
"I'm more aware of it because everyone else is talking about it," Boswell said of those records. "That has nothing to do with us getting a win this weekend or not. If we need four, cool. If we need zero and still win, I'm perfectly fine with that, too."
Boswell also set team records for most field goals over 50 yards in team history with 12 and twice kicked six field goals in a single game to account for all of the Steelers' points in wins over the Falcons and Ravens. Boswell is the only kicker in NFL history to have six field goals in a game twice and has a record three-such games in his career.
Overall, he's missed just three attempts this season, those coming from 62 and 58 yards, while a third attempt was blocked because of a missed block.
Boswell and Steelers special teams coordinator Danny Smith developed a plan this season where Boswell does not kick at all when the Steelers hold their final practice of the week.
"I wouldn't say saved my leg," Boswell said. "Obviously, we changed it this year and I'm having a good year, so it's easy to correlate the two. I don't know if that plays a part in it or takes away from it. It's just a new schedule that we talked about around the league with guys and what they do. It was different from what I've done. I feel good."
The new schedule has paid off with Boswell having his best season, and arguably, the best season for a kicker in NFL history. While Boswell has missed just three kicks this season, Akers missed eight field goal attempts in his record-breaking season.
Anderson made all 35 of his field goal attempts for the Vikings in 1998 when he set the then-NFL record with 164 points, but just two of his attempts were from 50 yards or longer.
Boswell, meanwhile, has made 12 of 14 kicks from beyond 50 yards this season and is 33 of 39 from 50 yards and beyond over the past four seasons.
Boswell is the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage from 50 or more yards among players with at least 50 or more attempts, having made 42 of his 51 long-distance attempts.
"I love the trust. I've got to do my job and keep making them to build that trust," Boswell said of Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin's propensity to have him attempt more long field gals. "I've done a decent job of that this year. But it's on to the next one and we'll figure that out next week.
"We don't talk about distance. We don't talk about anything. If he calls field goal, I go out and kick it. If he doesn't and we punt or we go for it, that's good too. That's kind of been our relationship. We don't talk about anything other than what we need to talk about on game day. If it's field goal, I kick it. That's literally the extent that I think about it."
Boswell, 33, has been with the Steelers since 2015 when he won a tryout to replace injured Shaun Suisham and has been the Steelers' placekicker since.
He's made 87.987 percent of his career field goals, including 93 percent this season. His percentage is fourth-best in NFL history, slightly behind all-time leader Justin Tucker of the Ravens (89.103 percent).
He also excels in shorter kicks. Over the past two seasons, Boswell has made all 18 of his attempts between 20 and 29 yards – where he's never missed in 79 career attempts – and is 19 of 19 between 30 and 39 yards.
"He's a unique weapon, for sure," said Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith.
Boswell is currently second in team history with 1,122 points, second only to Anderson's 1,343, a total he could surpass in the next two seasons.
But he doesn't look past his next kick, let alone his next season.
"I do pay too much mind. Just because I've been decent this year doesn't mean anything going into next year," Boswell said. "I've just got to do my best on the next kick and then we go after that. I don't really focus too much on future or past, get too high or too low. I just kind of swing away."
• Mark Twain is credited with the saying that there are "lies, damn lies and statistics." And Twain didn't live in today's age where sports are broken down into statistics on a constant basis.
Every NFL team employs an analytics department. And while some lean on that information more than others, they all utilize the information available to make decisions.
However, to Twain's point, sometimes the statistics don't give a true sense of what happened or has been happening.
For example, NFL NextGen Stats show that Watt did not record a single "pressure" in the Steelers' 29-10 loss to the Chiefs last week, while Alex Highsmith had two.

As a team, the Steelers had a "pressure rate" of just 17.9 percent and failed to sack Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes once.
Those are the statistics.
But a closer look at things shows that Mahomes' average time to pass in the game was 2.34 seconds, his fastest of the season. And that included some throws on which the Chiefs went to maximum protection and he held the ball a little longer. Most of his throws were coming out in well under 2.34 seconds.
Usain Bolt wouldn't have gotten to Mahomes unblocked, let alone getting through one or two blockers to do so.
This is nothing new for the Steelers this season, however. Countless opponents have gone to shorter, quicker passes against the Steelers during this season, knowing that they can't or don't want to risk holding up against Pittsburgh's pass rush.
As a result, the Steelers have allowed the most yards in the NFL on passing plays that come out in 2.5 seconds or less at 1,810.
That will be tested this week against the Bengals. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow leads the NFL in completions (248) and yards (2,234) on passes that come out in under 2.5 seconds this season. He's also thrown 20 touchdown passes in those situations.
In their first meeting, a 44-38 win by the Steelers, Burrow averaged 2.61 seconds per pass attempt. But he was 18 of 24 for 138 yards and an interception on passes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage – ones that came out quickly – and 10 of 13 for 171 and all three of his touchdowns on passes of 10 or more yards downfield – those that did not necessarily come out fast.
How does that compare to what Mahomes did last week?
Mahomes was 24 of 28 for 220 yards and one touchdown on passes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage last week, while he attempted just 10 passes beyond 10 yards, completing six of them for 110 yards and two touchdowns.
The key for the Steelers is not just tackling the catch, which they did better in that win over the Bengals, allowing just 5.8 yards per attempt on short completions, compared to 7.9 per attempt against Kansas City, it's winning on first and second downs to force the Bengals into third-and-long.
Quite simply, they can't allow Burrow – or future opponents, in general – to make short, easy rhythm throws. They have to force them into third-and-7 or longer to allow their pass rush to work.
"As a defensive lineman and as a front, we've got to get our hands ready," said Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward. "We've got to get some batted balls up in the air. We've got to win the early downs so it's not just rhythm passing. It's a collective effort. I know DBs got a job to do. They have to play press. They have to play zone. They've got to do different things, disguise things, as well.
"But as a front, we can mitigate some of that with stopping the run early so it's not just second-and-5 or third-and-5. Then, we've got to bat the ball up in the air and cause some turnovers."
• The Steelers' current three-game losing streak is obviously concerning.
But if you look at who the losses came to – at Philadelphia and Baltimore and at home against the Chiefs – it's not all that shocking.
After all, those are three of the best teams in the NFL and have a combined record of 39-9 going into the final week of the regular season.
The Steelers also own wins over the Ravens, as well as beating the Chargers, Broncos and Commanders, four teams currently in the playoffs.
But the perception is currently that they're a struggling football team because they happened to lose to three of the top teams in the league in their past three games, two of which were on the road.
Meanwhile, the Bengals are considered a team "nobody wants to play" because they've won their past four games since losing to the Steelers. But in addition to the Steelers they also have lost to the Ravens (twice), Eagles, Chiefs, Commanders and Chargers.
They just haven't lost any of those games in the past four weeks, though the Bengals have had two separate three-game losing streaks this season, including one in which they lost four out of five games to the Eagles, Ravens, Chargers and Steelers, with only a win over the hapless Raiders to show for more than a month of play.
The Bengals are 1-7 against teams currently in the postseason. The Steelers are 4-3 in such games.
The difference is that Cincinnati's games against playoff opponents were scattered throughout the season, while the Steelers have played three consecutive games against playoff-bound teams.
That doesn't mean the Bengals can't beat the Steelers on Saturday. But the perception that the Steelers are a stumbling team and the Bengals are red-hot is, shall we say, showing some recency bias.
The NFL doesn't track records only in the final month of the season. It tracks what you've done the entire season.
The Steelers earned a playoff bid a month ago based on how they have performed over the course of the season.
Losing three games in an 11-day span when they were beset by injuries doesn't change the fact that they've been a good team over the course of the season.

• The Steelers wound up with four players selected to the Pro Bowl earlier this week, as Heyward, Watt, safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and Boswell all were named starters on the AFC team.
The fact that Fitzpatrick earned the nod as the starting free safety for the AFC team should answer some questions regarding his overall play to those who have been questioning his effectiveness.
After all, Fitzpatrick did not win the fan vote at free safety in the Pro Bowl voting. That was Amani Hooker of the Tennessee Titans.
That Fitzpatrick still earned the only spot given to a free safety on the team shows that he was an overwhelming winner among voting of coaches and players. And, no offense to the fan voting, they might know a little bit more about who is playing well and who is not since they're the ones that have to game plan and play against a certain player.
Fitzpatrick goes into the Steelers' regular season finale with 93 tackles, an interception, a forced fumble and four pass defenses.
Could his overall numbers be better? Sure. Fitzpatrick, who led the NFL in 2022 with six interceptions, would love to have more turnovers.
"It's a huge honor. It means players, coaches and fans have decided who they want to represent their league. Even though this hasn't been my splashiest year, my best year, I think I still played a lot of good football, and they thought I was good enough to represent the AFC," said Fitzpatrick.
"I've been back in the post and doing my job for the most part. I was surprised (to be picked), but I'm honored."
Fitzpatrick might not have won the fan vote due to his lack of "big-time" turnover numbers. But the fact he obviously won the coach and player vote shows that those who study the game and have to play against him value what he's done.
• In their history, the Steelers are 8-1 at home playing on Saturday since the 1970 NFL merger. Their point differential in those games is plus-149.
That includes a five-game winning streak at home on Saturday games.
The Steelers' last loss in a home game played on a Saturday came in 1987, when they were beaten 19-13 by the Cleveland Browns.
The Steelers also own a 10-1 record in regular season games played in January under Tomlin, the best in the league since the 1970 NFL merger.

How he fits: Cameron Johnston
Contributing Writer/Editor
The Steelers have signed punter Cameron Johnston to a free agent contract. His addition should bring a level of consistency to the team's punting game.
A six-year NFL veteran, Johnston spent the first three seasons of his career in Philadelphia before signing as a free agent with the Houston Texans.
Johnston, 32, came to the NFL as an undrafted rookie after playing collegiately at Ohio State. Prior to signing at Ohio State, Johnston played Australian rules football as a midfielder.
"To be able to play in the AFC North, going to Ohio State and watching all of the games on TV, to be able to play in this division is massive," Johnston said. "My wife is from Columbus, Ohio, so to be able to get back up north, too, we love to be here."
The native of Australia has a big leg, as evidenced by his career 47.3-yard net average. But he's also been good kicking directionally throughout his career. In 2023, he averaged 4.25 seconds of hang time on his punts, which ranked 28th in the NFL, but his net average of 44.0 yards last season was fourth-highest in the NFL.
Johnston also placed 30 of his 66 punts a year ago inside the opposing 20, which tied for seventh-most in the NFL. Former Steelers punter Pressley Harvin, who was released at the end of the 2023 season, also placed 30 punts inside the opposing 20, but did so on 78 attempts.

In fact, Johnston was the only punter in the league who had at least 30 kicks downed inside the opposing 20 while attempting fewer than 73 attempts.
Johnston will replace the aforementioned Harvin as the Steelers' punter – and holder on kicks – and should be a clear upgrade.
In addition to placing 30 kicks inside the opposing 20, Johnston also forced 25 fair catches on his kicks last season. Harvin had 26 forced fair catches, but did so on 78 attempts.
And despite kicking indoors in Houston the past three seasons, Johnston cut his teeth kicking at Ohio State and then Philadelphia.
While Johnston has seen a dropoff in his punting average as the season advances, it's not quite as dramatic as that of Harvin.

Johnston has averaged 49.3 yards per punt in the month of September. His January punting average is 45.7 yards.
His background in Australian rules football lends itself to punting in the NFL.
"The way you pass the ball in the sport is by punting it," Johnston said. "I think the transition is easy, especially in the college game with rollout punts. It's just a skill set you learn from a very young age that you can transfer to playing over here."
Harvin averaged 46.1 yards per punt in his September games for the Steelers, but saw that average fall over the course of the season to 41.6 yards per punt in January games.
He's also been a holder for two of the league's more consistent placekickers, Jake Elliott with the Eagles and Kai Fairbairn with the Texans. Now he'll get to work with another great one in Steelers' placekicker Chris Boswell.

The Terrible Towel was the brainchild of former Steelers radio announcer Myron Cope during the playoffs in 1975 and helped provide the magic touch as the Steelers went on to win Super Bowl X over the Dallas Cowboys. Since then the Terrible Towel has been a staple in the homes of all Steelers fans, and players as well.
