    "context": [
      "The Winter Break period is not included. Meal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed based upon actual use. There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee. Financial Aid Adjustment Federal and institutional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student earns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is completed. Student grants and non-federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the withdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds. Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy Policy Statement No undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure This policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co- curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students. In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. 113",
      "should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop",

      "Final Examinations 1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self- scheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. 2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day of classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned. 44",
      "However, renewal contracts must conform with this policy. Retention of Student Work Policy The university reserves the right in all colleges to retain indefinitely any student work the faculty may select. All work not retained by the university must be claimed at the time specified on the bulletin boards (or other forms of communication) of the department concerned; otherwise, the work will be destroyed. Statute of Limitations \u2013 Master\u2019s Studies Students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a college/school may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing the master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 86"

      "There should be no expectation that the following points will cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the exam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course syllabus. In order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this document lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. Instructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the course syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the responsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with the instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed. Definitions \u2022 Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). \u2022 Scheduled final examinations.

An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self-scheduled examinations. \u2022 Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. \u2022 In-term examinations.

But the purposeful and intentional steps taken through programming \u2014 with events, their bar program and menu selections, plus hiring practices \u2014 is all geared toward touching diverse communities with the goal of everyone feeling comfortable in their space. Trace first evolved during COVID when the owners were simply brainstorming about where they envisioned things going once it was safe to gather and host events again. \u201cBut the density of Bloomfield and walkability/bikeability/public transit access was something we thought about,\u201d Soorma says, \u201cand the way that our space could sort of gel with the neighborhood as a part of folks' day to day.\u201d He adds, \u201cAlso, our General Manager (Katie Rado) has underrepresented communities in breweries literally at the top of her mind so there was no doubt our events would showcase, celebrate and pay Black, Queer artists and lead the way for other breweries to start thinking about their events strategies.\u201d",

      "The scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant \u201cTe lucis ante terminum.\u201d The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God\u2019s grace was given. The monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick. The Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman\u2019s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted. As the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby. The ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy\u2019s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost.

      "There is, as Tylor argued long ago, a \u201cmental gulf that divides the lowest savage from the highest ape\u201d (Anthropology). In line with the foregoing distinction, human behaviour is to be defined as behaviour consisting of, or dependent upon, symboling rather than upon anything else that Homo sapiens does; coughing, yawning, stretching, and the like are not human. Next to nothing is yet known about the neuroanatomy of symboling. Man is characterized by a very large brain, considered both absolutely and relatively, and it is reasonable\u2014and even obligatory\u2014to believe that the central nervous system, especially the forebrain, is the locus of the ability to symbol. But how it does this and with what specific mechanisms remain to be discovered. One is thus led to the conclusion that at some point in the evolution of primates a threshold was reached in some line, or lines, when the ability to symbol was realized and made explicit in overt behaviour. There is no intermediate stage, logical or neurological, between symboling and nonsymboling; an individual or a species is capable of symboling, or he or it is not. The life of Helen Keller makes this clear: when, through the aid of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, Keller was enabled to escape from the isolation to which her blindness and deafness had consigned her and to effect contact with the world of human meanings and values, the transformation was instantaneous. But even if almost nothing is known about the neuroanatomy of symboling, a great deal is known about the evolution of mind (or \u201cminding,\u201d if mind is considered as a process rather than a thing), in which one finds symboling as the characteristic of a particular stage of development. The evolution of minding can be traced in the following sequence of stages. First is the simple reflexive stage, in which behaviour is determined by the intrinsic properties of both the organism and the thing reacted to\u2014for example, the contraction of the pupil of the eye under increased",

      "Holy Cats by Andy Warhol\u2019s Mother\n\nHaving artistic talent herself, Julia Warhola recognized her youngest son Andy\u2019s abilities from a young age and encouraged him to pursue his passion, including sending him to Saturday art classes at Carnegie Museum of Art. When Warhol moved to New York City in 1949, it wasn\u2019t long before Julia joined him, and he began enlisting her to add her unique handwriting to hundreds of his drawings, advertisements, and book illustrations. Julia also loved to draw, with cats and angels as her favorite subjects. In 1956, the pair made a book about their cats, 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy , featuring illustrations combining Andy\u2019s blotted line drawings and calligraphy by Julia. When she left out the \u201cd\u201d in the book\u2019s title, her son loved it and opted to keep it anyway. Four years later, Julia wrote and illustrated Holy Cats by Andy Warhol\u2019s Mother .

Some 20 years later, a smaller yet still powerful framed print of the work hung in the Braddock municipal building. Thanks to the Art Lending Collection, Women Do Get Weary is one of more than 160 artworks available to anyone with an Allegheny County library card to borrow, display, and enjoy for up to three weeks at a time\u2014changing the dynamic of who gets to interpret and experience art.

That moment for me, and of course my emotional self, I'm sitting there boo-hooing because he was so proud of his mom. In those moments, when kids are able to be fulfilled, when they're able to have that look on their face of just being a kid, those are the things that I live for. \"It's seeing kids accomplish things they didn't think they could accomplish, things they have never done, and they take it on.

Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert\u2019s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts. Before long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator\u2014the \u201cworld\u2019s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot\u201d\u2014was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world\u2019s first university-wide computer network and file system. This growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country.

This isn\u2019t just a warm hand off. The office is dedicated to the victim and their family and will be by their side throughout the process. When Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich created this office and asked me to manage it, we were clear that we didn\u2019t just want to be another resource. We will serve as a partner to the community and we are committed to that partnership.\u201d\n\nMayor William Peduto said the effort is part of the City\u2019s goal of helping all residents. \"Public Safety provides many services but at the department's heart is one main goal, and that is to be there for people in need of help. Having a coordinator in place whose sole job is providing assistance to victims is a major part of the City's efforts to give help to all, and especially those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Mayor Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he is proud of the work of the Victims Assistance Office, as it speaks to the City- and Department-wide desire to put others first. \u201cPublic Safety is a dynamic department that doesn\u2019t only include First Responders who save lives daily in times of urgency and emergency,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cIt also includes compassionate people who methodically consider the long-term needs of those who need help, and then take steps to provide it.\u201d\n\nAbboud, who started in her position on Aug. 3, 2020, said her goal is to help victims throughout the process, which often means multiple follow-up contacts. \u201cThey need somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to them and say, \u2018I\u2019m here for you.",

The Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX can assist individuals in accessing these resources or individuals may contact the departments or organizations directly. Some of these resources are designated as confidential. Other resources provide support, but may need to involve the Title IX Coordinator and/or the University Police Department. Regardless of whether the university determines that Prohibited Conduct occurred, the university will offer resources or assistance to Complainants, Respondents, witnesses, and other impacted community members after receiving notice of alleged Prohibited Conduct. The university will also assist those individuals in identifying and contacting external law enforcement agencies and community resources, when desired by the individual. 1. Confidential Resources Carnegie Mellon understands that some individuals impacted by Prohibited Conduct, particularly conduct involving sexual violence, may not be ready or may not be willing to report through a channel that may lead to an investigation or other university action, no matter how discreet. For such individuals, Carnegie Mellon maintains several confidential reporting options. These resources can provide individuals with assistance, support, and additional information. Confidential Resources are prohibited from disclosing confidential information unless (1) given permission by the person who disclosed the information; (2) there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others; (3) the conduct involves suspected abuse of a minor under the age of 18; or (4) as otherwise required or permitted by law or court order.

To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful\u00a0\u2014 and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject:Women Don't AskandAsk for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want.

      "\u201cVictims\u00a0of crime experience trauma from the incident itself and trauma from the barriers encountered when accessing systems that were created to provide support and resources,\u201d said\u00a0Shatara Murphy, Public Safety Assistant Director, Community Affairs. \u201cThe Victim Assistance Office is the support that families need, helping to eliminate some of those barriers and connect them to service providers and support. This isn\u2019t just a warm hand off. The office is dedicated to the victim and their family and will be by their side throughout the process. When Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich created this office and asked me to manage it, we were clear that we didn\u2019t just want to be another resource. We will serve as a partner to the community and we are committed to that partnership.\u201d\n\nMayor William Peduto said the effort is part of the City\u2019s goal of helping all residents. \"Public Safety provides many services but at the department's heart is one main goal, and that is to be there for people in need of help. Having a coordinator in place whose sole job is providing assistance to victims is a major part of the City's efforts to give help to all, and especially those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Mayor Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he is proud of the work of the Victims Assistance Office, as it speaks to the City- and Department-wide desire to put others first. \u201cPublic Safety is a dynamic department that doesn\u2019t only include First Responders who save lives daily in times of urgency and emergency,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cIt also includes compassionate people who methodically consider the long-term needs of those who need help, and then take steps to provide it.\u201d\n\nAbboud, who started in her position on Aug. 3, 2020, said her goal is to help victims throughout the process, which often means multiple follow-up contacts. \u201cThey need somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to them and say, \u2018I\u2019m here for you.",

Conduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs the class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard to tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the responsibility of the individual instructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if major action, such as dropping the student from the course, is being considered. All classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all holidays and recesses. Both faculty and students are expected to be present. Members of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from classes to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of town, provided the following conditions are met: \u2022 All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; \u2022 No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are not scheduled; \u2022 The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization annually; \u2022 Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student affairs staff member.

It is expected that students will respect the wishes of faculty with regard to the use of electronic devices within the academic environment.

This University Libraries\u2019 exhibit is a portal to the past, a snapshot of life on campus more than four decades ago as our world began to transform! Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert\u2019s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts. Before long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator\u2014the \u201cworld\u2019s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot\u201d\u2014was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world\u2019s first university-wide computer network and file system. This growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country. By the decade\u2019s end, the university experience had transformed in ways few could have imagined. Learn more at https://library.cmu.edu/about/exhibits/cmu-1980s Add to my calendar.

      "reprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary probation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. Offenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very informal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal procedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human Resources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the Faculty Review Committee for faculty. Restrictions of Privileges During Investigations During the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may be necessary to temporarily suspend a user\u2019s network or computing privileges, but only after determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a risk to the university or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these cases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will be rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the misuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was \u201cattacked\u201d by a Carnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an attack.

American football fans witnessed a historic event as the Pittsburgh Steelers faced off against the Chicago Bears at Croke Park in Dublin on July 27, 1997. This exhibition game was part of the NFL's American Bowl Series, which aimed to promote the sport internationally and establish a global fan base.

      "They would stay awake until I got home to make sure I was okay, that I came back the same way I left. There were a lot of things back then that were really, really tough for African Americans, especially in the state of Alabama, especially in Mobile where I grew up.\"\n\nBut there was one love Mitchell always had, and race didn't impact it. He loved Alabama football. He would watch games on television with his family, or listen on the radio, and dream about the opportunity to go to Alabama and possibly play football one day for legendary coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant. Then, he witnessed what so many others did. On June 11, 1963, two black students, Vivian Malone and James A. Hood, showed up at to register at Alabama. Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway and blocked them from entering. Despite federal agents trying to intervene, Wallace didn't budge, and President John F. Kennedy ordered the Alabama National Guard to assist. Eventually Wallace gave in and allowed them to register. \"I can remember as a young kid when Governor Wallace stood in the doorway at the University of Alabama, not going to admit Vivian Malone and James Hood to the University,\" recalled Mitchell. \"Growing up as a young kid in Alabama in the 1950s and 60s, I saw a lot of things.\"\n\nDespite what he saw, he never gave up. Many would have just accepted what was in front of them. But Mitchell wasn't one to accept anything less than what others had. \"I just knew that if I wanted what they had, I have to do what they are doing, which was get a good education, find a way to have a job that would be in demand whether I was black, brown or whatever,\" said Mitchell. \"There weren't any big houses, or front yards, or nice cars in my neighborhood. I saw that on the other side of the tracks.",

      "But there were some I was close to and still am. \"When I went to class, most of them I was the only black student in them. When I went to class every day, I had to be prepared. I didn't want to sit in the classroom and be the only black person and the professor call on me and I say I am not prepared. I stayed up late at night to make sure I was prepared for class the next day. I would never let the white students say I wasn't smart or not prepared. I never wanted that to happen to me. I burnt a lot of midnight oil to make sure I was prepared. I would never let a professor call on me and say not prepared.\"\n\nMitchell still has a home in the Mobile area. He goes back every offseason and spends time there, enjoying the place he will forever call home.",
      "\"Tape? Check. Senior Bowl? Check. Forty? Check.\"\n\nMitchell, 6-foot, 195 pounds, made plenty of similar such statements last season and at the Senior Bowl. \"A mixture of Marshon Lattimore and Darius Slay is what one evaluator told me,\" NFL Network analyst Charles Davis reported. Lattimore went 11th overall to the Saints in 2017. Slay was a second-round pick of the Lions (36th overall) in 2013. Jeremiah listed Mitchell as the 15th-best prospect available prior to the Combine. That might no longer apply. \"You start asking yourself, if you're a team that needs a corner and you're picking up there in the top 10, what's to keep you from taking him all the way up there?\" Jeremiah wondered aloud. \"He's literally done everything you can do. The athleticism is elite, the ball skills are elite, the competitiveness. \"He's an impressive dude.\"\n\nMitchell ran a second 40 at 4.38. The NFL Network simulcast his first 40 with Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner's 4.41 from 2022 for perspective. As the numbers would suggest, Mitchell comfortably prevailed in that graphics-generated matchup. NFL Network analyst Peter Schrager mentioned Mitchell had been asked about playing in the Mid-American Conference and replied he considered himself the best player in MAC history. \"So, no shortage of confidence there,\" Schrager noted."

Six or more regular season games on a club's active/inactive, reserve/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists. Q. How do the free agency rules apply to restricted free agents? A. If a player with three accrued seasons has received a \"qualifying offer\" (a salary tender predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his old club, he can negotiate with any club through April 19. If the restricted free agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a \"right of first refusal\" on any offer sheet the player signs. If the old club does not match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the amount of its qualifying offer. If an offer sheet is not executed on or before April 18, the player's negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club. In addition, prior to the start of free agency a player who would otherwise be a restricted free agent may be designated by his old club as its franchise player or transition player. Q. What are the right of first refusal/qualifying offer amounts for players who have completed three accrued seasons? A. For right of first refusal only, a one-year salary of at least $3,263,000. For right of first refusal and compensation at the player's original draft round, a one-year salary of at least $3,406,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5",

MARK RICE FROM LAS VEGAS, NV: If the Steelers are interested in re-signing Russell Wilson, or Justin Fields, what is taking this long to sign one of them? ANSWER: Taking so long? You're talking about contracts that will end up being multi-year, multi-million-dollar deals. Taking so long? Seriously? The Steelers have exclusive negotiating rights with all of its own players until the start of the legal tampering period, which is on March 10. Today is Feb."

      "Arthur Smith, previous head coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three years (2021-23),  is in his \ufb01rst season as the Steelers' o\ufb00ensive coordinator in 2024. This marks his 16th year in the National Football League coaching ranks. Under Smith's guidance, the Falcons led the NFL in fewest penalties (2022), ranked third in successful play rate on rushing attempts, based on EPA, (2022), \ufb01nished third in rushing yards/game (2022), ninth in rushing yards/game (2023), 10th in third-down conversion rate (2022), 13th in third-down conversion rate (2023) and 13th in passing yards/attempt (2023). Atlanta eclipsed 400 total yards of o\ufb00ense on six occasions in 2023, tied for the fourth-most in single-season franchise history. The Falcons and Miami were the only teams in the NFL to \ufb01nish the season with a top-10 rushing attack and a top-\ufb01ve opponent pressure rate. Bijan Robinson \ufb01nished the season second among rookies with 1,463 yards from scrimmage. He recorded the most yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (1,463) and led all NFL rookies with 976 rushing yards, while adding 487 receiving yards and eight TDs (four rushing, four receiving). Robinson set the franchise record for most receptions by a rookie running back (58) and became the \ufb01fth rookie running back in League history to record at least 1,400 yards from scrimmage, 55 receptions and four receiving TDs. He also registered the most games with 100 yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (six). Kyle Pitts (667) and Jonnu Smith (582) are the \ufb01rst pair of tight ends to both have 500+ receiving yards in the same season since Zach Ertz (916) and Dallas Goedert (607) in 2019 with Philadelphia. Atlanta's rushing attack averaged 74.5 more rushing yards per game in 2022 than it did in 2021, resulting in the largest one-season improvement by any team since at least 2001. Additionally, Tyler Allgeier became the sixth rookie in the NFL, selected in the \ufb01fth round-or-later, to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards",

Craig was an outstanding player who brought both toughness and heart to the field during his 10 seasons with the Steelers. As an offensive lineman, his grit and dedication were essential to our success, contributing to the solid foundation of the Steelers' offensive line in the 1980s and 1990s. His work ethic and commitment to excellence were felt both in the locker room and on the field, and his leadership was always evident. Following his retirement from playing, Craig seamlessly transitioned into a broadcaster, providing insightful commentary and analysis as part of the Steelers Radio Network. His passionate voice and deep understanding of the game made him a trusted figure for Steelers fans, and his humor, warmth, and enthusiasm left a lasting impact on our community.

      "KEITH MILLER FROM CANTON, NC: It's never too early for fans to start preparing for the draft. Please explain how compensatory picks are awarded for lost free agents? ANSWER: This is from a story in The New York Times:\n\n\"Under the rules for compensatory draft selections, a team losing more or better compensatory free agents (\"CFA\") than it acquires in the previous year is eligible to receive compensatory draft picks, according to the NFL policy. Compensatory free agents are determined by a formula based on salary, playing time, and postseason honors. The formula was developed by the NFL Management Council. Not every free agent lost or signed by a club is covered by this formula. Clubs that suffer a net loss of CFAs during the prior free agent signing period are eligible to receive a corresponding number of compensatory selections. In addition, the formula factors in the value of the free agents lost.\"\n\nAsk Bob a question\n\nDo you have a question for Bob Labriola?

And that's because it's his son. Huskies' linebacker Carson Bruener is participating in the Combine, running a 4.59 in the 40-yard dash on both of his turns. The young Bruener said he had gotten plenty of advice from his father, who was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft and played nine seasons for the team. \"He's given me a lot of great pointers,\" said Bruener. \"Biggest thing is he's not a helicopter dad. He lets me enjoy this whole journey and just be myself. He'll give me pointers and tips here and there. I don't know what my true scouting report on myself really is. I haven't asked him, nor has he told me. \"He told me, 'You control what you can control, and you've done everything at this point to be where you're at.' I'm here, and this was my goal to be here, and I feel blessed to be here.\"\n\nBruener said he hasn't read any of his dad's scouting reports on himself and when he was interviewed by the Steelers at the Shrine Bowl, dad took a back seat. \"I walked in and there was a second room of interviews,\" shared Bruener. \"There was a certain amount of teams in each one, 15-minute interviews. The Steelers were the first team I met with in that room. My dad was sitting right across the table and he kind of stood up.",
      "\"The timing was right for me. It was quite a blessing.\"\n\nThanks to his time at Bradford High School, Brown was able to earn a scholarship to the University of Kansas. And ultimately the Steelers drafted him in the fifth round of the 1971 NFL Draft, landing him at a place that was an ideal situation. \"When I got here, you could just tell the makeup of the club, the way people were treated, the community aspect of the team itself and the coaching,\" said Brown. \"It was the perfect place for me. I got a chance to play on what arguably was one of the best teams that was ever assembled with all the players. There were a lot of players who didn't necessarily get some of the hype, but also very good players throughout the roster. The Rooneys and Coach (Chuck) Noll had a philosophy that was focused on the best players available. You felt like you were getting a fair shot. That's the way it was the whole time."

      "During Austin's senior year at Memphis, he was part of a group honored at the museum at the annual Black Men Crowned Awards, which honors Black males in the Memphis area for their leadership and accomplishments in different fields. Just knowing the history of the museum, being honored there moved Austin. \"That was very impactful for me,\" said Austin. \"Back then I didn't really see myself as somebody in the community that little kids, specifically young Black kids, could look up to. Being there and having kids talk to me, tell me they watched me at Memphis, and other things, it was very impactful. It made me reflect and know you're an example for people. I need to continue to put myself out there because by nature I'm kind of an introvert. But God blessed me with intelligence, and I know there are things I can do, and that encouraged me to continue to do them.\"\n\nAustin hopes that Dr. King's message, that his legacy, that his battle for all to be treated as one is something that never gets lost on today's youth. He knows how important it is for kids to continue to learn about it, whether it's in the classroom or through an educational and emotional trip to the museum. \"We're supposed to be one and united under God,\" said Austin. \"You don't want to stifle someone's legacy or a memory of them after they sacrificed so much, put their life on the line every day, to not teach the youth and not educate people on what he did. That would be a disservice or dishonor to what he stood for.",
      "The stories, many of which Boykin likes to just keep close to the vest, have been eye-opening for him and given him an even greater appreciation for those who came before him. \"You hear some of the things and it's almost unfathomable, but it seemed so normal to her,\" said Boykin. \"And now, she's just so grateful for everything. I truly think the older people are, the more appreciation they have for a lot of the things they had to go through. That's all we want for anybody. Hopefully when I'm 80-years old, I'll be able to say the same thing to my kids, and my grandkids, that they have been blessed in the world that they live and try to make it better for everybody. \"To me it means everything to hear stories from her because obviously oral history is so much better. The first-hand encounters are better than learning something from a book or watching it on television. Just the little things that my grandma would teach me about how things were when she was growing up. And even when my mom was growing up, how different things kind of were then as opposed to where we are today. \"It's huge to hear the stories because you don't want to forget where we came from.\"\n\nHearing the stories, understanding the struggles his grandmother went through, makes Boykin realize how far the country has come. But he is also aware of how much further we still need to go. \"I think we're always going to be working towards being perfect, because there's no such thing as perfect,\" said Boykin. \"Just seeing how far the needle has moved since then is definitely amazing.\"",

Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field.

      "verbal texts and visual images are appealingly combined with an eye to the adult male sports fans who are the magazines\u2019 principal readers. One consequence of this focus on male readers is that magazines such as Sports Illustrated and The Sporting News provide minimal coverage of women\u2019s sports (and tend to emphasize the erotic appeal of female athletes when they do allot space to women\u2019s sports). Despite the convenience of sports journalism in the print media, the reader\u2019s experience is\u2014by definition\u2014mediated. It still lacks a vibrant sense of immediacy. The diffusion of radio technology throughout Europe and North America in the 1920s allowed fans, absent from the game for whatever reason (distance, scheduling, venue capacity, cost), to listen in to play-by-play descriptions of events. A new market developed around those who tuned in to sports and hearkened to the sponsors\u2019 and advertisers\u2019 messages. Once radio broadcasting had been established, the next technological innovation\u2014television\u2014added the crucial visual to the existing audio dimension of live sports spectatorship. Television provides an unprecedented opportunity for vicarious experience. Initially, in the 1950s, those who staged, organized, and performed at sports events feared that the availability of games on television might keep fans from attending, especially if they could receive these live television sports broadcasts \u201cfree-to-air\u201d\u2014that is, for only the cost of the reception equipment and electrical power. The doubts quickly disappeared when it was discovered that television also had the capacity to generate legions of new sports fans. The enthusiastic response to sports programming provided sports organizations with a powerful new revenue stream: the sale of broadcast rights. By the late 20th century, as the cultural economy became increasingly important and the need to attract consumers to converging broadcast, computer, and telecommunications technologies became ever more urgent,",

But you know, we won't discuss that publicly, and usually those things are addressed at a later date.\"\n\nKhan also said he has had talks with the agent of pending free agent running back Najee Harris about a possible return, while he expects fellow running back Jaylen Warren, who is slated to be a restricted free agent, to return in 2025. That said, one of the deeper positions in the 2025 NFL Draft is running back. \"It's a good running back class, for sure,\" Khan said. \"It's an exciting group. We haven't closed the door on Naj. We have had conversations with Doug Henderson, his representative. So all options are on the table.\"\n\nThe Steelers also have some potential losses coming in free agency, as well. Two of the team's opening day starters on their offensive line, left tackle Dan Moore and right guard James Daniels, are slated to become free agents March 12. But having selected five offensive linemen in the past two drafts, Khan feels they have potential options already on the roster to replace those players. Broderick Jones, a first-round pick in 2023, has started the past two seasons at right tackle, but will be given a shot at left tackle in 2025. \"I'd say it's a safe assumption that going into this you know that he'll be the left tackle,\" Khan said. Meanwhile, 2024 fourth-round draft pick Mason McCormick moved into the starting lineup early in the season when Daniels suffered a torn Achilles' tendon and held down that spot. \"It was awesome,\" Khan said of McCormick's rookie season. \"Mason came in, a small-school guy.

In the past two years, the Steelers have selected offensive linemen Broderick Jones, Spencer Anderson, Troy Fautanu, Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick in the draft. All are 24 or younger, with Jones and Frazier being the youngest at 23. With Dan Moore scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins March 12, there is a good chance that at least four of the offensive linemen the Steelers have selected in the past two drafts will have a chance to start next season, with veteran guard Isaac Seumalo being the fifth starter. With so many young players in that group, it's not surprising that there were some struggles in 2024. In fact, the Steelers had four different players \u2013 Frazier, Fautanu, Anderson and McCormick \u2013 make their first career NFL starts during the first six weeks of the season. \"We absorbed a lot of attrition during the course of the journey,\" Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said at the end of the season. \"We ended up playing a lot of young people. They responded in a real positive way, but maybe they fatigued, mentally and physically.\"",

He finished his college career with 86 tackles, 55 of them solo stops, 13.5 tackles for a loss, eight and a half sacks, five passes defensed, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.

Shampklin was with the team throughout the offseason and through the preseason. Shampklin originally joined the Steelers when he signed a Reserve/Future contract at the end of the 2023 season. Prior to that he spent time with the Los Angeles Chargers in 2023, and also spent part of the 2022 season with the Indianapolis Colts and Dallas Cowboys. He played at Harvard where he was a two-time All-Ivy League selection, leading the league with a 92.8-yard rushing average per game in 2021. He finished his career with 402 carries for 2,251 yards and 23 touchdowns. Defensive tackle Jacob Slade \u2013 Slade spent the 2024 season on the practice squad.

      "The Steelers made multiple roster moves today, including activating offensive tackle Calvin Anderson to the 53-man roster from the Reserve/Injured, Designated for Return List. In addition, the team signed receiver Scotty Miller to the practice squad and elevated him to the Active/Inactive Roster for the game. Miller will revert back to the practice squad after the game. The team also elevated receiver Jamal Agnew from the practice squad to the Active/Inactive Roster for the game. Agnew will revert back to the practice squad after the game. The team also released safety Ayo Oyelola from the practice squad. Anderson, who was signed by the Steelers in September, was placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Dec. 14. He returned to practice earlier this week. Anderson, who was originally signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent following the 2019 NFL Draft, has appeared in 46 career games, starting 14. He spent time with the Patriots and New York Jets, before being signed to the Denver Broncos 53-man roster in 2019. Anderson played in all 16 games in 2020 for the Broncos, starting one at right tackle and one at left tackle. He appeared in 11 games in 2021, starting three, all at left tackle. In 2022, he played in 14 games, starting seven at left tackle for Denver, and allowed just two sacks, with no holding calls. Anderson signed with the New England Patriots as an unrestricted free agent ahead of the 2023 season. He appeared in five games, starting two, in 2023 before being placed on the Reserve/Injured List where he finished out the season. Miller, who was released from the 53-man roster on Thursday, signed a one-year contract with the team during the 2024 offseason. He has appeared in 13 games this season, starting one. He has five receptions for 69 yards. In six NFL seasons he has played in 80 games, pulling in 90 receptions for 1,154 yards and six touchdowns.

      "\"He has a desire to be great here. We have a desire for him to be great and to be great here with respect to the contract. But you know, we won't discuss that publicly, and usually those things are addressed at a later date.\"\n\nKhan also said he has had talks with the agent of pending free agent running back Najee Harris about a possible return, while he expects fellow running back Jaylen Warren, who is slated to be a restricted free agent, to return in 2025. That said, one of the deeper positions in the 2025 NFL Draft is running back. \"It's a good running back class, for sure,\" Khan said. \"It's an exciting group. We haven't closed the door on Naj. We have had conversations with Doug Henderson, his representative. So all options are on the table.\"\n\nThe Steelers also have some potential losses coming in free agency, as well. Two of the team's opening day starters on their offensive line, left tackle Dan Moore and right guard James Daniels, are slated to become free agents March 12. But having selected five offensive linemen in the past two drafts, Khan feels they have potential options already on the roster to replace those players. Broderick Jones, a first-round pick in 2023, has started the past two seasons at right tackle, but will be given a shot at left tackle in 2025. \"I'd say it's a safe assumption that going into this you know that he'll be the left tackle,\" Khan said. Meanwhile, 2024 fourth-round draft pick Mason McCormick moved into the starting lineup early in the season when Daniels suffered a torn Achilles' tendon and held down that spot. \"It was awesome,\" Khan said of McCormick's rookie season. \"Mason came in, a small-school guy. This was not too big for him.",

It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building\u2014which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh\u2014his \u201cmonument,\u201d and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That\u2019s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International , second only to the Venice Biennale as the world\u2019s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum\u2019s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of \u201ccolossal\u201d prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs.

Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966). Central to the city\u2019s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker.

Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin. By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal.[27]\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[76] Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built. In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51\u00a0km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district. In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979. Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans.",

Aside from creating the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's. The first City Hall at Market Square. The second City Hall on Smithfield Street. Mayor David Lawrence strikes the first blow for the demolition of the second City Hall. In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee."

Museum [ edit ] Main article: Point State Park Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources , announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination. Plans for improving the park are well underway. They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs.",

    "question": "When was the first iron furnace in Pittsburgh established?\n",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "With the decline of Roman influence, iron making continued much as before in Europe, and there is little evidence of any change for many centuries in the rest of the world. However, by the beginning of the 15th century, waterpower was used to blow air into bloomery furnaces; as a consequence, the temperature in the furnace increased to above 1,200\u00b0 C (2,200\u00b0 F), so that, instead of forming a solid bloom of iron, a liquid was produced rich in carbon\u2014i.e., cast iron. In order to make this into wrought iron by reducing the carbon content, solidified cast iron was passed through a finery, where it was melted in an oxidizing atmosphere with charcoal as the fuel. This removed the carbon to give a semisolid bloom, which, after cooling, was hammered into shape. In order to convert wrought iron into steel\u2014that is, increase the carbon content\u2014a carburization process was used. Iron billets were heated with charcoal in sealed clay pots that were placed in large bottle-shaped kilns holding about 10 to 14 tons of metal and about 2 tons of charcoal. When the kiln was heated, carbon from the charcoal diffused into the iron.",

      "occurred in 1751, when Benjamin Huntsman established a steelworks at Sheffield, Eng., where the steel was made by melting blister steel in clay crucibles at a temperature of 1,500\u00b0 to 1,600\u00b0 C (2,700\u00b0 to 2,900\u00b0 F), using coke as a fuel. Originally, the charge in the crucible weighed about 6 kilograms, but by 1870 it had increased to 30 kilograms, which, with a crucible weight of 10 kilograms, was the maximum a man could be expected to lift from a hot furnace. The liquid metal was cast to give an ingot about 75 millimetres in square section and 500 millimetres long, but multiple casts were also made. Sheffield became the centre of crucible steel production; in 1873, the peak year, output was 110,000 tons\u2014about half the world\u2019s production. The crucible process spread to Sweden and France following the end of the Napoleonic Wars and then to Germany, where it was associated with Alfred Krupp\u2019s works in Essen. A small crucible steelworks was started in Tokyo in 1895, and crucible steel was produced in Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S., from 1860, using a charge of wrought iron and pig iron. The crucible process allowed alloy steels to be produced for the first time, since alloying elements could be added to the molten metal in the crucible, but it went into decline from the early 20th century, as electric-arc furnaces became more widely used. It is believed that the last crucible furnace in Sheffield was operated until 1968. Bulk steel production was made possible by Henry Bessemer in 1855, when he obtained British patents for a pneumatic steelmaking process. (A similar process is said to have been used in the United States by William Kelly in 1851, but it was not patented until 1857.) Bessemer used a pear-shaped vessel lined with ganister, a refractory material containing silica, into which air was blown from the bottom through a charge of molten pig iron. Bessemer realized that the subsequent oxidation of the silicon and carbon in the iron would release heat and that, if a large"

      "ACT I. While preparing for their wedding, Figaro learns from Susanna that their philandering employer, Count Almaviva, has designs on her. At this news, the servant vows to outwit his master. Before long the scheming Bartolo enters the servants' quarters with his housekeeper, Marcellina, who wants Figaro to marry her to cancel a debt he cannot pay. After Marcellina and Susanna trade insults, the amorous page Cherubino arrives, reveling in his infatuation with all women. He hides when the Count shows up, furious because he caught Cherubino flirting with Barbarina, the gardener's daughter. The Count pursues Susanna but conceals himself when the gossiping music master Don Basilio approaches. The Count steps forward, however, when Basilio suggests that Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Almaviva is enraged further when he discovers Cherubino in the room. Figaro returns with fellow servants, who praise the Count's progressive reform in abolishing the droit de seigneur\u2014the right of a noble to take a manservant's place on his wedding night. Almaviva assigns Cherubino to his regiment in Seville and leaves Figaro to cheer up the unhappy adolescent. ACT II. In her boudoir, the Countess laments her husband's waning love but plots to chasten him, encouraged by Figaro and Susanna. They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a romantic assignation with the Count. Cherubino, smitten with the Countess, appears, and the two women begin to dress the page for his farcical rendezvous. While Susanna goes out to find a ribbon, the Count knocks at the door, furious to find it locked. Cherubino quickly hides in a closet, and the Countess admits her husband, who, when he hears a noise, is skeptical of her story that Susanna is inside the wardrobe. He takes his wife to fetch some tools with which to force the closet door. Meanwhile, Susanna, having observed everything from behind a screen, helps Cherubino out a window, then takes his place in the closet. Both Count and Countess",

Holland with the directive to \u201cbuy this for Pittsburgh.\u201d The reality is that the check came later. First came a tussle between the university and Holland\u2019s team to remove the fossils. After no additional bones were discovered at the site, Carnegie\u2019s bone hunters moved some 20 miles away to Sheep Creek, Wyoming, where, in July 1899, they found a nearly complete skeleton of a gigantic, long-necked sauropod dinosaur. It would take all of 130 crates to transport the bones of the 85-foot-long giant Diplodocus carnegii \u2014named after its financier\u2014to Pittsburgh via boxcar.

Carnegii\n\nIn October 1902, Andrew Carnegie was spending some time at Skibo Castle in northern Scotland, which he had recently purchased and fully renovated. \u201cAnd then one of these really weird coincidences happens,\u201d says Ilja Nieuwland, author of American Dinosaur Abroad: A Cultural History of Carnegie\u2019s Plaster Diplodocus . \u201cTotally unannounced, the English king, Edward, shows up on Andrew Carnegie\u2019s doorstep.\u201d",

      "Lamanna, Fikse, and Church walked along the same area, up a hillside, dispersing in a flat area against clementine-tinted cliffs. They were exploring a group of rocks called the Bajo Barreal Formation, a fossilized ecosystem that preserves dinosaurs and other animals that lived in what\u2019s now central Patagonia about 95 million years ago. As the wind began to pick up, Lamanna noticed something half buried in the dirt. \u201cI think I was at the site for about a minute or less, and I looked down and I saw a small piece of bone sticking partly out of the ground,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI realized right away it was part of a meat-eating dinosaur. Given where this bone was found, and the anatomical appearance of the bone, it\u2019s a virtual certainty it belonged to that same megaraptorid specimen we discovered 25 years ago!\u201d\n\nLamanna soon would identify his find as a foot bone, a piece of evidence that puts the team one step closer to being able to fully envision the dinosaur from the fossils they have and, eventually, name it. \u201cIt was really wild to go back to a site that was so foundational for me, not only in my work in Patagonia but in a lot of my research since then,\u201d he says. \u201cTo come back a quarter century later and find another bone of this thing was absolutely unexpected because we thought we\u2019d gotten it all. We were really fired up.\u201d\n\nHistory-Making Find\n\nBy the final week, the expedition had already been deemed a success. The team had made several key discoveries\u2014including bones of three different dinosaur species\u2014when two of the Argentinian scientists unearthed another history-making fossil. The group had moved to a new area, the R\u00edo Chico headwaters, where the rock formations date back roughly 70 million years. \u201cWe get these two brief windows into dinosaurs that lived about 70 and 95 million years ago, respectively, in this part of Patagonia,\u201d Lamanna says. They camped in a valley in the R\u00edo Chico region just in time for the most challenging weather of the trip."

      "\u201cThe reason I\u2019m painting this way,\u201d Andy Warhol famously told ARTnews in 1962, \u201cis that I want to be a machine.\u201d The machine-like method he was referring to is photographic silkscreen printing, a process that allowed him to quickly reproduce images en masse. For his iconic Flowers series, Warhol set his sights on a photograph of four hibiscus flowers in Modern Photography magazine taken by Patricia Caulfield. Changing its contrast and cropping the image into a square format, Warhol sent it to a commercial silkscreen maker with exacting specifications. Then, with the help of assistants, he copied it across more than 500 canvases, methodically producing paintings in different sizes\u2014mirroring the options of small, medium, large, and extra-large in consumer culture\u2014but with each new reproduction he would apply his own signature style. Caulfield was not amused. She sued Warhol but ultimately settled out of court for a reported $6,000, two paintings, and future royalties. When the canvases were exhibited in Paris and New York in 1964 and 1965, Warhol exploited the serial arrangement and variation in the series by responding to the architecture of each gallery and installing the works in floor-to-ceiling grids, resulting in an immersive environment.

      "\u00a9 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. Andy Warhol\u2019s Amiga Digital Art\n\nIn 1985, the electronics company Commodore introduced the world to the then-revolutionary Amiga 1000 personal computer. Amid great fanfare that featured a full orchestra and tuxedo-clad employees, the PC took center stage at New York City\u2019s Lincoln Center, accompanied by two revolutionaries in their own right\u2014Andy Warhol and Blondie\u2019s Debbie Harry. Never one to miss an opportunity to explore uncharted media, Warhol eagerly took on his new role as a Commodore brand ambassador. His assignment that day: Use the Amiga\u2019s ProPaint software to create a portrait of Harry in real time in front of a live audience. Warhol accomplished that goal, and more. For decades, 28 of his digital works\u2014among them, two self-portraits and the untitled renderings of a banana and Campbell\u2019s soup can\u2014existed only on floppy disks stored within The Warhol\u2019s archives. Then in 2014, the museum, artist Cory Arcangel, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s computer club set out to rescue the paintings from their decadeslong purgatory. After painstakingly reverse-engineering the program, the CMU squad revived Warhol\u2019s digital images.

They left with a dark and foreboding image baked into their brains, painted in 1950 by the museum\u2019s chief artist, Ottmar von Fuehrer. The floor-to-ceiling mural took the Carnegie Tech-trained artist months to complete, and museum visitors got to watch as the depiction of the fierce creature took shape. Part T. rex , part Godzilla, the lumbering dinosaur was based on the science of the day. Later that century, scientists learned that T. rex moved with its back held almost horizontal, with its powerful jaws just a few feet above eye level and its tail raised well off the ground.

Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development.

In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends.

      "Fortunately, one of Carnegie\u2019s hired fossil hunters, Bill Reed, knew his stuff and ultimately guided the expedition to another place in southeastern Wyoming known as Sheep Creek. In early July 1899, the crew stumbled upon a massive, nearly complete sauropod (long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur) skeleton. \u201cAround 150 million years ago, sauropods lived on every continent except possibly Antarctica. They ranged in weight from that of a horse all the way up to a sperm whale,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cThey were the largest plant-eating animals in a lot of the environments that they existed in. \u201cIn other words, [the team] had effectively found exactly what Andrew Carnegie was looking for.\u201d\n\nThe crew then spent the rest of the summer carefully extracting sauropod fossils and sending them back to Pittsburgh, where more experts busily cleaned rock off the bones and prepared them for display. What\u2019s even better is that the following summer, another Carnegie expedition returned to the same site and turned up yet another sauropod right next to the first. This was huge for two reasons. First, it allowed the scientists to compare the overlapping bones of the two skeletons and determine that they were mostly identical, which means the specimens belonged to the same, as-of-yet-undiscovered species. Second, having two partial skeletons allowed them to create a single composite mount that was nearly 100 percent complete\u2014something that is basically unheard of for an animal roughly the size of three African elephants put together. In 1901, the museum\u2019s paleontologist, John Bell Hatcher, made everything official by publishing a monograph that denoted the first skeleton as the \u201cholotype\u201d\u2014or the specimen used to describe a species for the first time. In the same study, it got its official name. \u201cAnd so Diplodocus carnegii came into being,\u201d says Lamanna. For most fossils, this would be the end of the story. But for Diplodocus carnegii , the adventures were just beginning.",
      "In its wonderfully creepy Alcohol House, Carnegie Museum of Natural History boasts about 230,000 reptiles and amphibians from 160 countries\u201495% of them fluid-preserved in jars. Each is a scientific time capsule, which is why researchers across the globe use them to study the ecology and evolution of species and their environments. Jennifer Sheridan, curator of amphibians and reptiles at the museum, recalls sleuthing for specimens from Southeast Asia when she came across a common snake known as Rhabdophis subminiatus (or red-necked keelback), that hailed from an uncommon locality\u2014Java, Indonesia. \u201cThe exact location detail is what caught my eye,\u201d Sheridan notes; \u201cthe island of Ternate, where British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was when he wrote his famous letter to Charles Darwin in 1858, explaining to Darwin his idea of evolution by natural selection.\u201d While traveling across Indonesia, Wallace had noticed a distinct change in the species of plants and animals found in two neighboring island groupings. Darwin would later jointly publish his own work on the topic alongside Wallace\u2019s. While the date of the specimen, 1872, is 10 years shy of being linked to Wallace\u2019s work on the island (he left a decade earlier), it\u2019s among the oldest in the museum\u2019s collection.

More than just toys\u2014although they certainly serve that important purpose\u2014dolls are found in almost every culture and provide insight into family roles, customs, and traditions. The museum displays a large collection of Hopi Katsina dolls, wooden effigies of supernatural beings who visit the Hopi for about half of every year, in its Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians. Traditionally carved from cottonwood root by Hopi men, the dolls are tangible evidence of the katsinam\u2019s power and wisdom. Parents use them to help teach children about Hopi culture and religious beliefs. The Hopi believe that katsinam spirits assist in plant growth, prevent misfortune, and bring rain, provided they are properly respected. Pictured is a Hahay\u2019iwuuti (Grandmother Katsina), made by Manuel Chavarria of First Mesa on the Hopi Reservation, in 1995 or 1996.

    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment",
      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.

      "Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum. Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing centre for the Federal government during the Civil War , under the charge of William Metcalf . Museum [ edit ] Main article: Point State Park Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources , announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart.

Count Almaviva comes in disguise to the house of Doctor Bartolo and serenades Rosina, whom Bartolo keeps confined to the house. Figaro the barber, who knows all the town\u2019s secrets and scandals, explains to Almaviva that Rosina is Bartolo\u2019s ward, not his daughter, and that the doctor intends to marry her. Figaro devises a plan: the count will disguise himself as a drunken soldier with orders to be quartered at Bartolo\u2019s house so that he may gain access to Rosina. Almaviva is excited and Figaro looks forward to a nice cash pay-off. Rosina reflects on the voice that has enchanted her and resolves to use her considerable wiles to meet the man it belongs to\u2014as Almaviva has led her to believe, a poor student named Lindoro. Bartolo appears with Rosina\u2019s music master, Don Basilio. Basilio warns Bartolo that Count Almaviva, who has made known his admiration for Rosina, has been seen in Seville. Bartolo decides to marry Rosina immediately. Basilio suggests slander as the most effective means of getting rid of Almaviva. Figaro, who has overheard the plot, warns Rosina and promises to deliver a note from her to Lindoro. Bartolo suspects that Rosina has indeed written a letter, but she outwits him at every turn. Bartolo warns her not to trifle with him. Almaviva arrives, creating a ruckus in his disguise as a drunken soldier, and secretly passes Rosina his own note. Bartolo is infuriated by the stranger\u2019s behavior and noisily claims that he has an official exemption from billeting soldiers. Figaro announces that a crowd has gathered in the street, curious about the argument they hear coming from inside the house.

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]",
      "New immigrants and migrants\n\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire.",

City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals. After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines. In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting. In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance.

Secured $1 million in federal funding to launch Post Overdose Support Teams (POST) next year which\n\nwill perform secondary response to individuals who refuse medical treatment after experiencing an\n\noverdose. The team will consist of certified peer recovery specialists and case managers. The response\n\nwill foster a connection that places the individual in a deescalated state following the overdose and\n\nprovide social and service supports to prevent future overdoses\n\nThe Community Partnership Specialist ensures that the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and needs\n\nremains at the forefront of each program. To date we have: Distributed over 1,000 Narcan, 500 fentanyl\n\ntest strips, 820 gun safety locks, 300 CPR face shields and attended and tabled 6 harm reduction fairs in\n\nthe City in collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Department.

      "Through the tireless work of our frontline workers, public safety liaisons, and subject matter experts we aim to address the needs of those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness or housing instability, substance use disorder, and mental or behavioral health challenges. It is our goal that our most vulnerable residents can be embraced by their neighbors and welcomed back in their communities. The Office of Community Health & Safety has piloted novel yet best-practice driven programs such as Co-Response, Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, Trauma Survivor\u2019s Assistance, People In Need of Support, Post Overdose Support Team, and Reaching Out On The Streets. From helping family survivors of suicide and gun violence to those experiencing homelessness, each of these programs focuses on centering individual needs and reducing harm. The Office of Community Health and Safety was announced in 2020, and since then we have sought not only to support community members who need assistance but do so in a financially responsible manner. We have successfully applied for numerous state and federal grants, funding our Post Overdose Support Team and Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program through federal funding mechanisms. Our partners in the Pittsburgh Bureaus of Police, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services are also indispensable as we connect community members who utilize 911 with longer term support. Central to our mission is to listen to the voices of all our community members and ensure that our programs serve those in need, especially those who have experienced historical and structural inequities and discrimination. Our programs are all voluntary, person centered, trauma informed and built on the principles of harm reduction. We are a team of Community Social Workers, Police Officers, Firefighters, Paramedics, EMTs, programming staff, and most of all \u2013 all passionate Pittsburgh residents working towards common goals.

This data will also provide the Office of Community Health and Safety and its partners with a more complete picture of the impacted neighborhoods, allowing for direct engagement with community leaders who best understand the needs of their neighbors. \u201cIn response to the worsening crisis, the Office of Community Health and Safety is committed to utilizing insights gained from\u00a0improved data analysis\u00a0to inform progressive opioid overdose prevention strategies that seek to reduce harm associated with drug use, employ a person-first approach, and address social determinants of health,\u201d said Laura\u00a0Drogowski,\u00a0Office of Community Health and Safety Manager.

The City of Pittsburgh is among stakeholders partnering with ACHD through this county-wide program to monitor emerging trends to inform prevention activities that reduce harms\u00a0associated\u00a0with substance use. Mayor Peduto created\u00a0The Office of Community Health and Safety in June with the goal of\u00a0redirecting city resources to better meet community needs by housing social services, public health and social work experts who can assist first responders in situations that require longer-term assistance, harm reduction support and other services.

      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.

In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment"

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]",

    "context": [
      "In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125]\n\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127]\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.[128]",
      "Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226]\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230]\n\nSome people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories \"police budget cost per person,\" \"fines / forefeitures,\" \"Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),\" \"Force Used per Arrest,\" \"Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,\" \"Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,\" \"Discrimination Complaints Upheld,\" \"Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,\" \"Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,\" and \"Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.\" This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231]\n\nEducation\n\nColleges and universities",
      "According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area.[118] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200.[129] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center.[130][131]\n\nEconomy\n\nPittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services.",

      "Anderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is. \"I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger,\" said Anderson. \"So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time.\"\n\nSpencer Anderson Cause: Autism Speaks\n\nSpencer Anderson's heart told him that the cause he chose for his cleats as a part of My Cause My Cleats was the right choice to make.

Interacting with him you know they are real people, they interact normally. They have their moments, but they can do good in society and in the world.

In addition, a penalty of one-half of one\n\npercent (0.5%) of the amount of the unpaid tax or each month or fraction thereof,\n\nduring which the tax remains unpaid, shall be added and collected. 11-\n\nARTICLE III\n\nTAXABILITY\n\nSection 301.\u2014Period Used in Calculating the Tax. (a)\n\nThe tax is measured by the amount of service transacted by the Taxpayer\n\nor Institution during the entire receding calendar year, except for those taxpayers:\n\n(1)\n\nwho were not in service during the whole of the preceding calendar\n\nyear, or\n\n(2)\n\nwho began services during the current calendar year, or\n\n(3)\n\nwhose service is temporary, seasonal or itinerant.

How is the LST deducted from the employee\u2019s pay and remitted to the City? Example,\n\nemployees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more. What is\n\nthe employer\u2019s responsibility? ANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro-rata share of the tax by dividing\n\n$52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. The $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per\n\nmonth for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculating the pro-rata share, employers are\n\nrequired to round down to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. The employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The\n\ntax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The LST forms can be\n\ndownloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\n\n2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City\n\nfor the entire calendar year. Should the employer withhold the LST? ANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that\n\nhe will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to\n\nwithhold the LST. The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available\n\nfor employees to complete. The exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\n\n3.

      "Professional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937\u201345 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947\u201348 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961\u201363), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970\u201372), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004\u201308) and Phantoms (2009\u201310) both of the ABA. Three Pittsburgh universities, the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and Robert Morris University, compete in NCAA Division I basketball. Pitt and Duquesne are the traditional basketball powers in the city, but all three universities have made multiple appearances in the National Invitation Tournament and NCAA tournament. Pitt won two pre-NCAA tournament National Championships in 1928 and 1930[215] while Duquesne won the NIT title in 1955, its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Both Pitt and Duquesne have reached the NCAA tournament Final Four once, Duquesne in 1940 and Pitt in 1941. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. Soccer\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Riverhounds play their home games at Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[citation needed]\n\nGolf",

The School of Medicine, originally chartered in 1886 as the Western Pennsylvania Medical College, joined the university in 1892. The school\u2019s name was changed to the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. The central feature of the main campus is its Cathedral of Learning, a 42-story Gothic skyscraper. Notable alumni include dancer Gene Kelly, filmmaker Werner Herzog, and philanthropist Andrew Mellon. Jonas Salk conducted his polio-vaccine research while on the medical school faculty.",

      "Longtime Owner Occupant: Homeowners must have owned and lived in the same property for at least 10 years (or 5 years if they received housing assistance). Property Assessment Increase: Homeowners must experience an assessment value increase of more than 25% from one year to the next, or a 50% increase over a 5-year period. Income: Household income must be at or below 120% of the Area Median Income. Tax Payments: All real estate taxes must be current, or a payment plan must be in place with the Department of Finance. Pittsburgh\u2019s commitment to preserving affordable housing amidst growing gentrification pressures is stronger than ever. Mayor Gainey\u2019s leadership ensures that LOOP will be implemented efficiently and equitably. The application period for the program would run annually from January 1st to June 30th, with exemptions applied retroactively to the current tax year. Participants would then automatically receive the exemption each year until they sell their home or no longer meet eligibility requirements. Mayor Gainey Announced the submission of LOOP authorizing legislation as part of the Keep Pittsburgh Home campaign, a multi-pronged effort to address the root causes of Pittsburgh\u2019s housing affordability crisis by pursuing funding and legal reforms to increase funding for affordable housing development, change regulations to encourage more housing construction, and combat displacement caused by real estate speculation and gentrification. The event also highlighted the successes of other homeownership programs implemented or supported by the Gainey Administration, including OwnPGH , the Homeowner Assistance Program , and the Whole Home Repair Program .

    "question": "How many homicides were there in Pittsburgh in 2018?\n",
    "context": [
      "As always, all emergencies should be immediately reported to 9-1-1. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2021) --\u00a0The recent surge in violent crime in the City of Pittsburgh is causing concern and even fear among some residents. Pittsburgh Police share that concern, especially as many of the victims of these crimes have been young people. So far this year, there have been 20 homicides in the City and close to 50\u00a0non-fatal shootings, marking 80% and 90% increases respectively from the same time last year. Pittsburgh is not alone in dealing with this, as the escalation of\u00a0violent crime is currently a national phenomenon. \"Although this uptick in violence appears to be a trend across the country, this is not our city. This is not Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will not allow this senseless loss of life to continue. Our officers will work directly with the community to get to the root cause of these crimes and stop them from occurring,\" Police Chief Scott Schubert said.",
      "Next year we hope to see the continued downward trend of these numbers. But that will only be done through the help of the community, technology and most importantly the work of Pittsburgh Police.\u201d\n\nThere were 71 homicides in 2014. The total dropped to 60 in 2015, 59 in 2016, 58 in 2017 and 55 in 2018. There were 174 non-fatal shootings in 2015, when Police began creating the\u00a0Group\u00a0Violence Intervention (GVI) Unit, which targets at-risk members of the community and offers guidance and services to escape a life of violence and crime. The number rose to 188 in 2016, then dropped to 140 in 2017 and 114 in 2018.",
      "Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226]\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230]\n\nSome people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories \"police budget cost per person,\" \"fines / forefeitures,\" \"Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),\" \"Force Used per Arrest,\" \"Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,\" \"Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,\" \"Discrimination Complaints Upheld,\" \"Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,\" \"Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,\" and \"Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.\" This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231]\n\nEducation\n\nColleges and universities",
      "And here you are.\u201d\n\nPITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 30, 2020) -- The City of Pittsburgh saw significant reductions in several key crime categories in 2019, most notably in homicides. Police officials credited the reductions to several factors, including excellent police work, a focus on community outreach and engagement, the lifesaving work of medics, firefighters and hospitals, partner law enforcement agencies, and the communities and residents we serve. \u201cSo many different things go into it,\u201d Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s hard work by our officers. Day in and day out, they amaze me with their work ethic, expertise and professionalism. And day in and day out, they make me proud to be their Chief. Others also deserve credit, including community members, our law enforcement partners at the local, state and federal levels, our amazing medics and hospitals and our community outreach efforts. \u201cBut while these numbers are encouraging, at the end of the day even one homicide is too many, one person being shot is too many,\u201d Chief Schubert said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll keep working. We won\u2019t be happy until the numbers are even lower.\u201d\n\nHomicides in the city dropped 36 percent year-on-year, from 58 in 2018 to 37 in 2019. The drop continues a downward trend over the past five years, and marks the fewest homicides in the city since 1998. In addition, the number of combined non-fatal shooting incidents plus homicides continued to trend downwards for a fourth year in a row:\n\n2016: 253 2017: 187 2018: 163 2019: 146",

    "question": "When did Pittsburgh begin producing steel?\n",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

      "Other major employers include BNY Mellon, GlaxoSmithKline, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Lanxess. The Northeast U.S. regional headquarters for Chevron Corporation, Nova Chemicals, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, FedEx Ground, Ariba, and the RAND Corporation call the area home. 84 Lumber, Giant Eagle, Highmark, Rue 21, General Nutrition Center (GNC), CNX Gas (CXG), and Genco Supply Chain Solutions are major non-public companies headquartered in the region. The global impact of Pittsburgh technology and business was recently demonstrated in several key components of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner being manufactured and supplied by area companies.[144] Area retail is anchored by over 35 shopping malls and a healthy downtown retail sector, as well as boutique shops along Walnut Street, in Squirrel Hill, Lawrenceville and Station Square. The nonprofit arts and cultural industry in Allegheny County generates $341 million in economic activity that supports over 10,000 full-time equivalent jobs with nearly $34\u00a0million in local and state taxes raised.[145]\n\nA leader in environmental design, the city is home to 60 total and 10 of the world's first green buildings while billions have been invested in the area's Marcellus natural gas fields.[146] A renaissance of Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry\u2014that boasts the world's first movie theater\u2014has grown from the long-running Three Rivers Film Festival to an influx of major television and movie productions. including Disney and Paramount offices with the largest sound stage outside Los Angeles and New York City.[147]",
      "The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45]\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\u00a0million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[48]\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development."

Because grant funding allows\n\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the\n\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant. In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects\n\nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding\n\nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield\n\nBridge supported by a State grant award..

YCLA will provide opportunities for youth to access, explore, and experience career fields typically deemed off-limits for youth of color and those without significant monetary and social capital within Pittsburgh including decision-making fields like civics, education, and infrastructure. Through a 3 phased experiential learning and project-based approach, YCLA will equip youth with insights into Pittsburgh\u2019s past, resources of the present, and the vision of Pittsburgh's future with the mayor being a direct mentor committed to imbuing youth with a sense of belonging and relevant regional identity. Beyond a transactional or removed level of engagement merely informing youth that certain career fields exist,\n\nYCLA provides a literal one-of-a-kind immersive and integrative experience made possible through the leadership of the City of Pittsburgh Office of the Mayor and supporting partners-the Community College of Allegheny County, the Heinz History Center, Partner4Work, and Youth Enrichment Services, Inc. (YES) YCLA scholars will not only see themselves as capable of having a career but also as being a part of Pittsburgh\u2019s career ecosystem. Youth will earn college credit through a partnership with CCAC and be enrolled in a course that is specially designed to support their civic competency but also exposure to city departments in hopes to obtain a job given their area of interest. They will be able to participate in a circuit-style internship experience over the 11 weeks in the program.

      "The most common format used for CDAP meetings follows the below outline. City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals. After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines. In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting. In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance.

The new Public Safety Center -- which will serve residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings -- is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them.

Carnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing non-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to support these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and preserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus-wide recycling program is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for Carnegie Mellon.

This University Libraries\u2019 exhibit is a portal to the past, a snapshot of life on campus more than four decades ago as our world began to transform! Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert\u2019s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts. Before long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator\u2014the \u201cworld\u2019s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot\u201d\u2014was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world\u2019s first university-wide computer network and file system. This growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country. By the decade\u2019s end, the university experience had transformed in ways few could have imagined. Learn more at https://library.cmu.edu/about/exhibits/cmu-1980s Add to my calendar.

      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.

During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S.

      "PITTSBURGH, PA (Feb. 27, 2020) \u2013 The City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Public Safety Department continues to prepare for a possible outbreak of Coronavirus in the region. Although no cases have been reported here -- the closest reported U.S. case is in Boston -- Public Safety plans for all possibilities at all times. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich began holding regular meetings to address Coronavirus concerns in early January. Those meetings continue. Public Safety\u2019s readiness plans include updating the city\u2019s 2014 Pandemic operational plan, which has been completed. As part of that update, contingency plans were added to ensure additional EMS personnel and units if necessary. In addition, First Responders have been trained to identify possible cases of Coronavirus, and to take steps to provide medical care or isolate patients if necessary. As part of that training, First Responders were provided with enhanced personal protection kits that contain face masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and protective eyewear to be worn in the event they encounter someone with the virus. To achieve operational readiness, the city is checking all EMS vehicles, including ambulances, to ensure they are working properly. City officials have also reached out to local hospitals and Allegheny County and suburban public safety officials to coordinate preparedness and response plans. Citizens can do their part in simple ways, most importantly by washing their hands often. \u201cThis is about being prepared,\u201d Director Hissrich said.",

    "question": "In which year was the first coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?\n",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

      "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment",
      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers. Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L.",

By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G."
