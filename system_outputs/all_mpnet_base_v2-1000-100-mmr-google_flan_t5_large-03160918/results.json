They left with a dark and foreboding image baked into their brains, painted in 1950 by the museum\u2019s chief artist, Ottmar von Fuehrer. The floor-to-ceiling mural took the Carnegie Tech-trained artist months to complete, and museum visitors got to watch as the depiction of the fierce creature took shape. Part T. rex , part Godzilla, the lumbering dinosaur was based on the science of the day. Later that century, scientists learned that T. rex moved with its back held almost horizontal, with its powerful jaws just a few feet above eye level and its tail raised well off the ground. So, von Fuehrer\u2019s mural had to go. But his work is still on view today\u2014from the painting of Mt.",

      "His 1998 trip to the Estancia Laguna Palacios was Lamanna\u2019s first international dinosaur expedition, and one that was transformative for him, personally and professionally. He developed deep friendships with the Argentinian paleontologists he worked with and began a scientific collaboration that has helped shape his career. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers,\u201d Lamanna said of his Argentinian colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m very much a guest on their project. I think I may add a little in terms of scientific expertise, I guess that\u2019s why they keep inviting me back\u2014though I think they might enjoy my company just a little bit, too. Either way, it\u2019s a privilege to be invited to do these kinds of things.\u201d\n\nTwo other associates from the museum\u2014Kara Fikse and Linsly Church\u2014joined Lamanna to document the journey, search for fossils, and help preserve any discoveries. Every fossil discovered stayed in Argentina so scientists there could continue to study them. Return Engagement",

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]",
      "Early colonization (1747\u20131763)\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]\n\nEuropeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000\u00a0acres (800\u00a0km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130\u00a0km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt.",
      "In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town\", near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town\", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]:\u200a148"

A coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions provided the Pittsburgh region with the opportunity to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come.

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city"
