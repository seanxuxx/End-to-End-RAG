    "context": [
      "The Winter Break period is not included. Meal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed based upon actual use. There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee. Financial Aid Adjustment Federal and institutional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student earns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is completed. Student grants and non-federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the withdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds. Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy Policy Statement No undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure This policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co- curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students. In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. 113",
      "should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop",

      "Final Examinations 1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self- scheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. 2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day of classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned. 44",
      "However, renewal contracts must conform with this policy. Retention of Student Work Policy The university reserves the right in all colleges to retain indefinitely any student work the faculty may select. All work not retained by the university must be claimed at the time specified on the bulletin boards (or other forms of communication) of the department concerned; otherwise, the work will be destroyed. Statute of Limitations \u2013 Master\u2019s Studies Students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a college/school may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing the master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 86"

In particular ensuring: \u2022 appropriate use of resources (e.g. any such work is completed outside of university time and does not utilize shared resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth to a degree that adversely impacts academic or research activities); \u2022 appropriate use of licenses (e.g. do not use software procured with academic use licenses for commercial applications or development, unless the license explicitly permits such use); \u2022 appropriate marketing (e.g. no creation of \u201c.com\u201d domains within Carnegie Mellon\u2019s \u201cedu\u201d domain, no advertising services and products using Carnegie Mellon email accounts, and no advertising using web pages on Carnegie Mellon servers (any server with a .CMU.EDU host name). In cases of questionable personal use of resources, you may contact it- help@andrew.cmu.edu to determine whether a particular activity is permissible.

      "The scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant \u201cTe lucis ante terminum.\u201d The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God\u2019s grace was given. The monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick. The Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman\u2019s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted. As the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby. The ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy\u2019s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost.

      "There is, as Tylor argued long ago, a \u201cmental gulf that divides the lowest savage from the highest ape\u201d (Anthropology). In line with the foregoing distinction, human behaviour is to be defined as behaviour consisting of, or dependent upon, symboling rather than upon anything else that Homo sapiens does; coughing, yawning, stretching, and the like are not human. Next to nothing is yet known about the neuroanatomy of symboling. Man is characterized by a very large brain, considered both absolutely and relatively, and it is reasonable\u2014and even obligatory\u2014to believe that the central nervous system, especially the forebrain, is the locus of the ability to symbol. But how it does this and with what specific mechanisms remain to be discovered. One is thus led to the conclusion that at some point in the evolution of primates a threshold was reached in some line, or lines, when the ability to symbol was realized and made explicit in overt behaviour. There is no intermediate stage, logical or neurological, between symboling and nonsymboling; an individual or a species is capable of symboling, or he or it is not. The life of Helen Keller makes this clear: when, through the aid of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, Keller was enabled to escape from the isolation to which her blindness and deafness had consigned her and to effect contact with the world of human meanings and values, the transformation was instantaneous. But even if almost nothing is known about the neuroanatomy of symboling, a great deal is known about the evolution of mind (or \u201cminding,\u201d if mind is considered as a process rather than a thing), in which one finds symboling as the characteristic of a particular stage of development. The evolution of minding can be traced in the following sequence of stages. First is the simple reflexive stage, in which behaviour is determined by the intrinsic properties of both the organism and the thing reacted to\u2014for example, the contraction of the pupil of the eye under increased",

      "Holy Cats by Andy Warhol\u2019s Mother\n\nHaving artistic talent herself, Julia Warhola recognized her youngest son Andy\u2019s abilities from a young age and encouraged him to pursue his passion, including sending him to Saturday art classes at Carnegie Museum of Art. When Warhol moved to New York City in 1949, it wasn\u2019t long before Julia joined him, and he began enlisting her to add her unique handwriting to hundreds of his drawings, advertisements, and book illustrations. Julia also loved to draw, with cats and angels as her favorite subjects. In 1956, the pair made a book about their cats, 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy , featuring illustrations combining Andy\u2019s blotted line drawings and calligraphy by Julia. When she left out the \u201cd\u201d in the book\u2019s title, her son loved it and opted to keep it anyway. Four years later, Julia wrote and illustrated Holy Cats by Andy Warhol\u2019s Mother .

Some 20 years later, a smaller yet still powerful framed print of the work hung in the Braddock municipal building. Thanks to the Art Lending Collection, Women Do Get Weary is one of more than 160 artworks available to anyone with an Allegheny County library card to borrow, display, and enjoy for up to three weeks at a time\u2014changing the dynamic of who gets to interpret and experience art.

His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named \"Win-Win: How to Get What You Want,\" started with Carnegie\u00a0Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful\u00a0\u2014 and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject:Women Don't AskandAsk for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want. In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William \"Red\" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean\u00a0up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.",

Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City\u2019s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) launched a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system came a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process allowed event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event.

      "reprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary probation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. Offenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very informal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal procedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human Resources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the Faculty Review Committee for faculty. Restrictions of Privileges During Investigations During the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may be necessary to temporarily suspend a user\u2019s network or computing privileges, but only after determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a risk to the university or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these cases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will be rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the misuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was \u201cattacked\u201d by a Carnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an attack.

Disruptive commercial properties threaten the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Pittsburgh and burden its public safety services. When owners repeatedly violate the law by permitting illegal activities onsite or failing to properly maintain their commercial properties, the City may take action against them. Such action is reserved for repeated, unabated offenses. A commercial property may be designated as Disruptive pursuant to Chapter 670 only after a single felony violation or at least three citations for disruptive activity. Neighbors disturbed by properties in disrepair are advised to contact the City\u2019s 3-1-1 Response Center to initiate a complaint. Designation as a Disruptive Property has serious consequences. The Public Safety Director is authorized to charge the property owner for all costs of law enforcement or public services called to a Disruptive Property.

      "\"Tape? Check. Senior Bowl? Check. Forty? Check.\"\n\nMitchell, 6-foot, 195 pounds, made plenty of similar such statements last season and at the Senior Bowl. \"A mixture of Marshon Lattimore and Darius Slay is what one evaluator told me,\" NFL Network analyst Charles Davis reported. Lattimore went 11th overall to the Saints in 2017. Slay was a second-round pick of the Lions (36th overall) in 2013. Jeremiah listed Mitchell as the 15th-best prospect available prior to the Combine. That might no longer apply. \"You start asking yourself, if you're a team that needs a corner and you're picking up there in the top 10, what's to keep you from taking him all the way up there?\" Jeremiah wondered aloud. \"He's literally done everything you can do. The athleticism is elite, the ball skills are elite, the competitiveness. \"He's an impressive dude.\"\n\nMitchell ran a second 40 at 4.38. The NFL Network simulcast his first 40 with Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner's 4.41 from 2022 for perspective. As the numbers would suggest, Mitchell comfortably prevailed in that graphics-generated matchup. NFL Network analyst Peter Schrager mentioned Mitchell had been asked about playing in the Mid-American Conference and replied he considered himself the best player in MAC history. \"So, no shortage of confidence there,\" Schrager noted.",

Today, receiver Miles Boykin shares why Black History Month is important to him and how hearing from those who came before him has inspired and touched him. There are lessons we all learn in life that come from so many sources, but for receiver Miles Boykin, when it comes to Black History Month, there is no greater source than his grandmother, Cornelia Brigmon. \"Black culture is such a part of American culture,\" said Boykin. \"I think we need to relay that to everybody and recognize its importance in the United States today. \"For me, listening to my grandma is one of the best ways to do it. My grandma would always tell me stories. She is turning close to 80-years old now, so she has some crazy stories. She was born during segregation. I can't even remember the whole specifics, but it was her mom or her grandmother who was born a slave and then they were eventually able to leave out of it.

While she is passionate about all of the above and pours her heart and soul into everything she does, there is nothing that touches her the way her role as Executive Director of the Best of the Batch Foundation does, a role she has embraced since 2002. The Best of the Batch Foundation was founded in 1999, fulfilling a promise Charlie Batch made after his younger sister, Danyl Settles, was shot and killed in 1996, in the crossfire between rival gangs in their Homestead neighborhood. Through the Best of the Batch Foundation, they have established themselves as true difference makers, people the community and region can depend on, to be there for the youth in particular to help give them a better future. The foundation has been serving the area now for 25 years and has been built into a force to serve others by the two. The Foundation was originally housed in a 5,300 square foot building in the Homestead area. Earlier this year, they opened a new 'Clubhouse,' a building that was originally planned for 21,000 square feet, but through additional development is now a state-of-the-art educational facility that is 33,000 square feet. The foundation's mission is to provide children in grades K-12 in Western Pennsylvania free programs focused on education, health and wellness, outreach services and more, with the majority of the activities taking place in the 'Clubhouse,' a welcoming, safe place",

Just knowing the history of the museum, being honored there moved Austin. \"That was very impactful for me,\" said Austin. \"Back then I didn't really see myself as somebody in the community that little kids, specifically young Black kids, could look up to. Being there and having kids talk to me, tell me they watched me at Memphis, and other things, it was very impactful. It made me reflect and know you're an example for people. I need to continue to put myself out there because by nature I'm kind of an introvert. But God blessed me with intelligence, and I know there are things I can do, and that encouraged me to continue to do them.\"\n\nAustin hopes that Dr. King's message, that his legacy, that his battle for all to be treated as one is something that never gets lost on today's youth. He knows how important it is for kids to continue to learn about it, whether it's in the classroom or through an educational and emotional trip to the museum. \"We're supposed to be one and united under God,\" said Austin. \"You don't want to stifle someone's legacy or a memory of them after they sacrificed so much, put their life on the line every day, to not teach the youth and not educate people on what he did.

Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince. [ 130 ] Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett , who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015. [ 131 ] Former analysts include Don Hoak , Nelson Briles , and Jim Rooker .

      "5. Luther Burden III, Missouri, 6-0, 206 lbs. - Burden ran a 4.41 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. That isn't \"Golden fast\" but it's fast enough for Burden to excel as a run-after-the-catch wide receiver and as one who is capable of taking the top off of a defense. Sleeper: Savion Williams, TCU, 6-4, 222 lbs. - He won't sleep long and he won't hit snooze. Not with the \"Wildcat QB\" component Williams will bring to his eventual NFL team. Williams caught  60 passes for 611 yards and six touchdowns in 2024. He also carried 51 times for 322 yards and six more scores. His NFL comparison in the eyes of some is Cordarrelle Patterson.

      "CONTENT:\n\nDefensive line takes center stage at NFL Scouting Combine\n\nINDIANAPOLIS - One of the conundrums faced by teams when it comes to drafting defensive tackles is if the player is really good at stopping the run, can he also give a team enough as a pass rusher to now allow himself to be taken out of a game? For example, as good as former Steelers nose tackle Casey Hampton was against the run, opponents could dictate how much he played in a game simply by going to three wide receiver sets and forcing the Steelers to match their wide receivers on the field with a nickel defense. Finding a nose tackle who also has pass rushing ability is key. The Steelers had that in Javon Hargrove, whom they selected in the third round of the 2016 NFL Draft. They feel they could have that in 2023 second-round draft pick Keeanu Benton, who has manned the team's nose tackle position the past two seasons. But adding another player to that equation who might allow Benton to perhaps become a defensive end and not be forced to play nose tackle could be something in which the Steelers are interested in accomplishing in the 2025 NFL Draft. Fortunately, this particular draft has a number of players who might offer that prospect. \"This is a really good draft for the defensive line,\" Steelers general manager Omar Khan said. And topping the list of players who might step in and make an immediate impact for the Steelers is Michigan defensive tackle Kenneth Grant. A 6-foot-3, 342-pound defensive lineman, Grant offers the flexibility to have the size and run-stuffing ability to be a true nose tackle, while also offering enough athleticism to rush the passer situationally. Grant had 6.5 sacks the past two seasons for the Wolverines. \"I'm a 3-down player for sure,\" Grant said here Wednesday at the NFL Scouting Combine. \"I can rush the passer with my strength and a little bit of finesse in there. Most guys think I'm just a run-stopper, but I'm super athletic and can rush the passer.\"",
      "That being said, there could be some surprises, as we'll see good players at the position taken in Rounds 3 and 4. The wildcard will be Colorado's Travis Hunter. I, however, view him as a cornerback prospect who will play wide receiver as a secondary position. Dale's Rankings\n\n1. Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona, 6-4 1/8, 219 lbs. - A big receiver with good ball skills, McMillan was extremely productive, posting over 80 catches and 1,300 yards in each of the past two seasons, winning as a size mismatch. Will that translate to the NFL against bigger, more physically gifted receivers? We'll see. He has good run-after-the-catch ability but isn't necessarily a blazer. There's definitely a tantalizing skillset here.",

      "2. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, * 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton is a big back with great bit play abilities as both a runner and receiver who runs away from defenders in the open field. This is a very physical downhill runner that delivers an awful lot of contact. His pass protection skills could use more work and Hampton isn't the shiftiest guy in this class, but he projects as a feature back at the next level. 3. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Henderson was fantastic in the college playoffs this season and is a big play waiting to happen every time he touches the football. While he probably doesn't project to a high-carry workhorse role in the league, Henderson will give his new team an immediate jolt. Henderson has good size for a back with his dynamism while also excelling in pass protection. 4. Kaleb Johnson, Iowa, 6-1, 224 lbs. - Johnson is coming off a big season for the Hawkeyes. He is extremely well built but can run a little bit high at times. Johnson has very good vision and patience and is best suited for a predominantly zone scheme. He is somewhat of a linear athlete, but Johnson has very good long speed for a back his size. 5. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State, 5-11 5/8, 221 lbs. - Judkins and Henderson made for an outstanding one two punch in the National Champions backfield this season with their complementary styles. Judkins is much more of a banger than Henderson with great aggression but isn't in Henderson's realm in terms of breakaway speed. Sleeper: Jordan James, Oregon, 5-9 1/2, 205 lbs. - Oregon is a major college football program so it isn't like their top running back is a true sleeper that would fall through the cracks. But James backed up Bucky Irving (who went on to have an exceptional rookie season) a year ago, making James just a one-year starter and therefore, doesn't have as many carries at the college level as many of these prospects. James has excellent vision and contact balance but is somewhat limited thus far"

In the 2025 league year, players with three accrued seasons who have received a qualifying offer become restricted free agents when their contracts expire at the conclusion of the 2024 league year on March 12. Unrestricted free agents have completed four or more accrued seasons. Upon expiration of his 2024 contract, an unrestricted free agent is free to sign with any club with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club. Q. What constitutes an \"accrued season\"? A. Six or more regular season games on a club's active/inactive, reserve/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists. Q. How do the free agency rules apply to restricted free agents? A. If a player with three accrued seasons has received a \"qualifying offer\" (a salary tender predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his old club, he can negotiate with any club through April 19. If the restricted free agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a \"right of first refusal\" on any offer sheet the player signs. If the old club does not match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the amount of its qualifying offer. If an offer sheet is not executed on or before April 18, the player's negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club. In addition, prior to the start of free agency a player who would otherwise be a restricted free agent may be designated by his old club as its franchise player or transition player. Q. What are the right of first refusal/qualifying offer amounts for players who have completed three accrued seasons? A. For right of first refusal only, a one-year salary of at least $3,263,000. For right of first refusal and compensation at the player's original draft round, a one-year salary of at least $3,406,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5",

      "Arthur Smith, previous head coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three years (2021-23),  is in his \ufb01rst season as the Steelers' o\ufb00ensive coordinator in 2024. This marks his 16th year in the National Football League coaching ranks. Under Smith's guidance, the Falcons led the NFL in fewest penalties (2022), ranked third in successful play rate on rushing attempts, based on EPA, (2022), \ufb01nished third in rushing yards/game (2022), ninth in rushing yards/game (2023), 10th in third-down conversion rate (2022), 13th in third-down conversion rate (2023) and 13th in passing yards/attempt (2023). Atlanta eclipsed 400 total yards of o\ufb00ense on six occasions in 2023, tied for the fourth-most in single-season franchise history. The Falcons and Miami were the only teams in the NFL to \ufb01nish the season with a top-10 rushing attack and a top-\ufb01ve opponent pressure rate. Bijan Robinson \ufb01nished the season second among rookies with 1,463 yards from scrimmage. He recorded the most yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (1,463) and led all NFL rookies with 976 rushing yards, while adding 487 receiving yards and eight TDs (four rushing, four receiving). Robinson set the franchise record for most receptions by a rookie running back (58) and became the \ufb01fth rookie running back in League history to record at least 1,400 yards from scrimmage, 55 receptions and four receiving TDs. He also registered the most games with 100 yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (six). Kyle Pitts (667) and Jonnu Smith (582) are the \ufb01rst pair of tight ends to both have 500+ receiving yards in the same season since Zach Ertz (916) and Dallas Goedert (607) in 2019 with Philadelphia. Atlanta's rushing attack averaged 74.5 more rushing yards per game in 2022 than it did in 2021, resulting in the largest one-season improvement by any team since at least 2001. Additionally, Tyler Allgeier became the sixth rookie in the NFL, selected in the \ufb01fth round-or-later, to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards",

Craig was an outstanding player who brought both toughness and heart to the field during his 10 seasons with the Steelers. As an offensive lineman, his grit and dedication were essential to our success, contributing to the solid foundation of the Steelers' offensive line in the 1980s and 1990s. His work ethic and commitment to excellence were felt both in the locker room and on the field, and his leadership was always evident. Following his retirement from playing, Craig seamlessly transitioned into a broadcaster, providing insightful commentary and analysis as part of the Steelers Radio Network. His passionate voice and deep understanding of the game made him a trusted figure for Steelers fans, and his humor, warmth, and enthusiasm left a lasting impact on our community. On behalf of the entire Steelers organization, we offer our deepest condolences to Craig's family, friends, and all who had the privilege of knowing him.

      "KEITH MILLER FROM CANTON, NC: It's never too early for fans to start preparing for the draft. Please explain how compensatory picks are awarded for lost free agents? ANSWER: This is from a story in The New York Times:\n\n\"Under the rules for compensatory draft selections, a team losing more or better compensatory free agents (\"CFA\") than it acquires in the previous year is eligible to receive compensatory draft picks, according to the NFL policy. Compensatory free agents are determined by a formula based on salary, playing time, and postseason honors. The formula was developed by the NFL Management Council. Not every free agent lost or signed by a club is covered by this formula. Clubs that suffer a net loss of CFAs during the prior free agent signing period are eligible to receive a corresponding number of compensatory selections. In addition, the formula factors in the value of the free agents lost.\"\n\nAsk Bob a question\n\nDo you have a question for Bob Labriola?

And that's because it's his son. Huskies' linebacker Carson Bruener is participating in the Combine, running a 4.59 in the 40-yard dash on both of his turns. The young Bruener said he had gotten plenty of advice from his father, who was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft and played nine seasons for the team. \"He's given me a lot of great pointers,\" said Bruener. \"Biggest thing is he's not a helicopter dad. He lets me enjoy this whole journey and just be myself. He'll give me pointers and tips here and there. I don't know what my true scouting report on myself really is. I haven't asked him, nor has he told me. \"He told me, 'You control what you can control, and you've done everything at this point to be where you're at.' I'm here, and this was my goal to be here, and I feel blessed to be here.\"\n\nBruener said he hasn't read any of his dad's scouting reports on himself and when he was interviewed by the Steelers at the Shrine Bowl, dad took a back seat. \"I walked in and there was a second room of interviews,\" shared Bruener. \"There was a certain amount of teams in each one, 15-minute interviews. The Steelers were the first team I met with in that room. My dad was sitting right across the table and he kind of stood up.",
      "\"The timing was right for me. It was quite a blessing.\"\n\nThanks to his time at Bradford High School, Brown was able to earn a scholarship to the University of Kansas. And ultimately the Steelers drafted him in the fifth round of the 1971 NFL Draft, landing him at a place that was an ideal situation. \"When I got here, you could just tell the makeup of the club, the way people were treated, the community aspect of the team itself and the coaching,\" said Brown. \"It was the perfect place for me. I got a chance to play on what arguably was one of the best teams that was ever assembled with all the players. There were a lot of players who didn't necessarily get some of the hype, but also very good players throughout the roster. The Rooneys and Coach (Chuck) Noll had a philosophy that was focused on the best players available. You felt like you were getting a fair shot. That's the way it was the whole time."

      "The average offensive lineman 40 time was 5.13, the fastest by an offensive line group at a Combine. IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE MEASURABLES: Campbell is widely regarded as one of the prized offensive line prospects in the draft but there are some who question whether he'll wind up at guard because of his 325/8-inch arms. Campbell isn't among the concerned. \"It's no secret I don't have the stereotypical offensive lineman arms but I've never had them,\" he told Dales. \"There were concerns when I was coming into college, I handled it fine. And, obviously, there's concerns now and I'm gonna handle it fine whenever a team gives me the opportunity.\"\n\nCollege tackles with arms shorter than 33\" often end up at guard in the NFL. But to Campbell that's not necessarily a definitive indicator as to whether a player is better suited for guard or tackle. Dales also reported Campbell told her \"blocking is done with your feet.\"\n\nAIN'T THAT TOUGH ENOUGH: Jackson didn't run 40s and looked to be struggling to a degree in drills. At one point he received attention from the medical staff and had his right thigh wrapped. \"I don't know that he looks super healthy,\" Jeremiah said. \"You can see a strain on his face as well when he's trying to finish a drill. I admire the competitiveness but it's not necessary at this point. You got 55 starts at Ohio State, that's enough. I love you competing if you're healthy but if you're not 100 percent it's not worth that.\"\n\nAdded Davis, who worked on the field as well as upstairs at an anchor desk: \"I said to him, 'Are you OK young man?' He just looked at me and defiantly said, 'I'm doing great,' and just went back to the line. \"He doesn't look right, I think everyone's kind of seeing there may be something a little bit off but he's doing his best to fight his way through it.\"\n\nRelated Content\n\nSkill position players make a big statement\n\nRBs, WRs, QBs have strong days at NFL Scouting Combine Saturday\n\nSpeed on display at the Combine",
      "No record breaker: Friday, Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond said he would break the combine record 40-yard dash of former teammate Xavier Worthy set in 2024. Worthy ran a 4.21-second 40-yard dash at Indianapolis last year. \"I'm going to break the record, for sure,\" Bond said Friday. \"I anticipate running 4.20 or possibly, if I'm feeling great, I might run 4.1.\"\n\nHis confidence didn't match the reality, as Bond was timed at 4.39 seconds in the 40. In fact, he wasn't even the fastest Texas receiver at the combine. Teammate Matthew Golden ran an official 4.29-second 40-yard dash T 5-11 \u215b and 191 pounds running in the same early group of wide receivers. Golden is considered a potential first-round prospect and Jeremiah compared him to former Steelers WR Santonio Holmes. \"He's one of my favorites to watch for a number of reasons,\" Jeremiah said. \"He's just really crisp. He just snaps everything off.\"\n\nGolden's time was the second-fastest for a wide receiver weighing at least 190 pounds since 2003. Tennessee's Donte Thornton Jr. nearly matched him at 6-4 \u00bd and 205 pounds, but was officially timed at 4.30 seconds. Overall, it was one of the fastest groups of wide receivers in combine history, as 10 players posted times of sub-4.40 seconds, the most since the NFL Network began tracking it in 2003. Faulkner runs the drill: Steelers running backs coach Eddie Faulkner is known for incorporating a lot of drill work with his position at practices. Saturday, he ran the running backs group through a drill named after former Steelers running back Duce Staley, getting an up-close look at this group. The drill is a footwork drill combined with a vision approach, as runners go forward, backward and side to side stepping over pads on the field. They then explode toward three big bags held by coaches who lean the pads one way or another to simulate a block."

Through 59 games, the 6-foot-2, 192-pound defenseman has posted seven goals, 48 assists and a career-high 55 points. Harding\u2019s 48 assists are a single-season franchise record among Steelheads defensemen, and his assist and point totals both rank fifth across the entire league among defensemen. Additionally, his plus-43 is currently ninth in the league across all players, and third among blueliners. The Toronto, Ontario native has played 190 games for the Steelheads over the course of three seasons from 2022-25. During that span, he has recorded 19 goals, 80 assists, 99 points and is plus-90. He has one goal and two assists for three points in 11 playoff games with the Steelheads. Harding was originally selected by Pittsburgh in the seventh round (223rd overall) of the 2024 NHL Draft. ================================================================================\n\nURL: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/penguins-simply-weren-t-good-enough-in-philadelphia\n\nTITLE: Penguins \"Simply Weren't Good Enough\" in Philadelphia | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nThe Penguins dropped the first game of a home-and-home with the Flyers on Tuesday at Wells Fargo Center, 6-1. \u201cI don\u2019t think we played particularly good today,\u201d Erik Karlsson said.",

There are lessons we all learn in life that come from so many sources, but for receiver Miles Boykin, when it comes to Black History Month, there is no greater source than his grandmother, Cornelia Brigmon. \"Black culture is such a part of American culture,\" said Boykin. \"I think we need to relay that to everybody and recognize its importance in the United States today. \"For me, listening to my grandma is one of the best ways to do it. My grandma would always tell me stories. She is turning close to 80-years old now, so she has some crazy stories. She was born during segregation. I can't even remember the whole specifics, but it was her mom or her grandmother who was born a slave and then they were eventually able to leave out of it. Just some of the stories that she tells me really makes me grateful for what I have today and grateful for those who came before me.\"",

      "During Austin's senior year at Memphis, he was part of a group honored at the museum at the annual Black Men Crowned Awards, which honors Black males in the Memphis area for their leadership and accomplishments in different fields. Just knowing the history of the museum, being honored there moved Austin. \"That was very impactful for me,\" said Austin. \"Back then I didn't really see myself as somebody in the community that little kids, specifically young Black kids, could look up to. Being there and having kids talk to me, tell me they watched me at Memphis, and other things, it was very impactful. It made me reflect and know you're an example for people. I need to continue to put myself out there because by nature I'm kind of an introvert. But God blessed me with intelligence, and I know there are things I can do, and that encouraged me to continue to do them.\"\n\nAustin hopes that Dr. King's message, that his legacy, that his battle for all to be treated as one is something that never gets lost on today's youth. He knows how important it is for kids to continue to learn about it, whether it's in the classroom or through an educational and emotional trip to the museum. \"We're supposed to be one and united under God,\" said Austin. \"You don't want to stifle someone's legacy or a memory of them after they sacrificed so much, put their life on the line every day, to not teach the youth and not educate people on what he did. That would be a disservice or dishonor to what he stood for.",
      "The stories, many of which Boykin likes to just keep close to the vest, have been eye-opening for him and given him an even greater appreciation for those who came before him. \"You hear some of the things and it's almost unfathomable, but it seemed so normal to her,\" said Boykin. \"And now, she's just so grateful for everything. I truly think the older people are, the more appreciation they have for a lot of the things they had to go through. That's all we want for anybody. Hopefully when I'm 80-years old, I'll be able to say the same thing to my kids, and my grandkids, that they have been blessed in the world that they live and try to make it better for everybody. \"To me it means everything to hear stories from her because obviously oral history is so much better. The first-hand encounters are better than learning something from a book or watching it on television. Just the little things that my grandma would teach me about how things were when she was growing up. And even when my mom was growing up, how different things kind of were then as opposed to where we are today. \"It's huge to hear the stories because you don't want to forget where we came from.\"\n\nHearing the stories, understanding the struggles his grandmother went through, makes Boykin realize how far the country has come. But he is also aware of how much further we still need to go. \"I think we're always going to be working towards being perfect, because there's no such thing as perfect,\" said Boykin. \"Just seeing how far the needle has moved since then is definitely amazing.\"",

Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field.

      "verbal texts and visual images are appealingly combined with an eye to the adult male sports fans who are the magazines\u2019 principal readers. One consequence of this focus on male readers is that magazines such as Sports Illustrated and The Sporting News provide minimal coverage of women\u2019s sports (and tend to emphasize the erotic appeal of female athletes when they do allot space to women\u2019s sports). Despite the convenience of sports journalism in the print media, the reader\u2019s experience is\u2014by definition\u2014mediated. It still lacks a vibrant sense of immediacy. The diffusion of radio technology throughout Europe and North America in the 1920s allowed fans, absent from the game for whatever reason (distance, scheduling, venue capacity, cost), to listen in to play-by-play descriptions of events. A new market developed around those who tuned in to sports and hearkened to the sponsors\u2019 and advertisers\u2019 messages. Once radio broadcasting had been established, the next technological innovation\u2014television\u2014added the crucial visual to the existing audio dimension of live sports spectatorship. Television provides an unprecedented opportunity for vicarious experience. Initially, in the 1950s, those who staged, organized, and performed at sports events feared that the availability of games on television might keep fans from attending, especially if they could receive these live television sports broadcasts \u201cfree-to-air\u201d\u2014that is, for only the cost of the reception equipment and electrical power. The doubts quickly disappeared when it was discovered that television also had the capacity to generate legions of new sports fans.

That said, one of the deeper positions in the 2025 NFL Draft is running back. \"It's a good running back class, for sure,\" Khan said. \"It's an exciting group. We haven't closed the door on Naj. We have had conversations with Doug Henderson, his representative. So all options are on the table.\"\n\nThe Steelers also have some potential losses coming in free agency, as well. Two of the team's opening day starters on their offensive line, left tackle Dan Moore and right guard James Daniels, are slated to become free agents March 12. But having selected five offensive linemen in the past two drafts, Khan feels they have potential options already on the roster to replace those players. Broderick Jones, a first-round pick in 2023, has started the past two seasons at right tackle, but will be given a shot at left tackle in 2025. \"I'd say it's a safe assumption that going into this you know that he'll be the left tackle,\" Khan said. Meanwhile, 2024 fourth-round draft pick Mason McCormick moved into the starting lineup early in the season when Daniels suffered a torn Achilles' tendon and held down that spot. \"It was awesome,\" Khan said of McCormick's rookie season. \"Mason came in, a small-school guy. This was not too big for him.",

In the past two years, the Steelers have selected offensive linemen Broderick Jones, Spencer Anderson, Troy Fautanu, Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick in the draft. All are 24 or younger, with Jones and Frazier being the youngest at 23. With Dan Moore scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins March 12, there is a good chance that at least four of the offensive linemen the Steelers have selected in the past two drafts will have a chance to start next season, with veteran guard Isaac Seumalo being the fifth starter. With so many young players in that group, it's not surprising that there were some struggles in 2024. In fact, the Steelers had four different players \u2013 Frazier, Fautanu, Anderson and McCormick \u2013 make their first career NFL starts during the first six weeks of the season. \"We absorbed a lot of attrition during the course of the journey,\" Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said at the end of the season. \"We ended up playing a lot of young people. They responded in a real positive way, but maybe they fatigued, mentally and physically.\"",

      "In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today we look at the life, legacy and career of Lowell Perry. Inside the library at the Steelers office at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, prominently located behind the six Super Bowl trophies the team has won, is a wall that is home to photos of the best of the best who have ever worn the black and gold. A total of 94 pictures adorn the wall, all of them with meaning. The vast majority of the pictures are the same ones that hung on the wall in Art Rooney Sr.'s office at Three Rivers Stadium, with some added through the years. The photos are a who's who in Steelers' history, names that roll off the tongue of Steelers fans with ease. Joe Greene. Jack Lambert. Terry Bradshaw. Lynn Swann. I could list others, but you get the point. The players were special and had a special place in Art Rooney Sr.'s heart. One of those photos is of a player who Steelers fans not familiar with the early history of the team might not recognize, because his career wasn't a long one. However, his impact on Rooney, the Steelers, the NFL and the business world was. Below a photo of Lambert, and above one of Bradshaw, is a picture of Lowell Perry. Perry was selected by the Steelers in the eighth round of the 1953 NFL Draft. Perry's arrival with the Steelers was delayed for three seasons due to ROTC duties. In 1956 Perry was able to finally join the Steelers for a delayed rookie season. It was time to live out his dream of playing in the NFL, something he waited a long time for. Sadly, though, his career would be cut short before it barely even began. In the sixth game of his rookie campaign, one that was showing amazing signs of promise for a long and heralded career for the receiver and kick returner, it was abruptly cut short due to injury. While it ended his playing career, it was the start of a lifetime of breaking racial barriers. *"

After composing herself, she continued to talk about her son Reid, who passed away in 2018 of leukemia at just 22-years old. \"It's pretty big,\" said Garrant. \"I miss my son. It happened so quickly when the whole leukemia thing happened. It was 16 hours from the time he was diagnosed until he died. It was crazy. \"My son Reid played with Pat and his brother, Timmy. My son was a senior when Pat was a freshman. We are from the same hometown, the same school. It just means so much.\"\n\nFreiermuth said he wanted to bring attention to Garrant and the foundation, hoping to help others battling the same disease, so he is wearing cleats to support them once again. \"It means a lot,\" said Freiermuth. \"Just being able to wear those cleats and put recognition to that foundation. Reid's mom has worked so hard to get her son's name out there. Being able to help in that process on a national stage like that is awesome. \"It is cool. The more eyes on the cleats, the better. That is what really helps the cause.\"\n\nOne of the things that touches Garrant's heart the most is that Reid was a Steelers fan his entire life and would have been overjoyed that Freiermuth was drafted by them. \"Reid's favorite team from the time he was born, he had no choice because of his dad, was the Steelers,\" said Garrant. \"He came out in black and gold. Pat doing this not only for his teammates, friends, family, our community and Reid's organization, it means so much. \"When he was drafted by the Steelers, it was a divine intervention. It means so much to me."

Aside from creating the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's. The first City Hall at Market Square. The second City Hall on Smithfield Street. Mayor David Lawrence strikes the first blow for the demolition of the second City Hall. In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee."

    "question": "When was the first iron furnace in Pittsburgh established?",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "With the decline of Roman influence, iron making continued much as before in Europe, and there is little evidence of any change for many centuries in the rest of the world. However, by the beginning of the 15th century, waterpower was used to blow air into bloomery furnaces; as a consequence, the temperature in the furnace increased to above 1,200\u00b0 C (2,200\u00b0 F), so that, instead of forming a solid bloom of iron, a liquid was produced rich in carbon\u2014i.e., cast iron. In order to make this into wrought iron by reducing the carbon content, solidified cast iron was passed through a finery, where it was melted in an oxidizing atmosphere with charcoal as the fuel. This removed the carbon to give a semisolid bloom, which, after cooling, was hammered into shape. In order to convert wrought iron into steel\u2014that is, increase the carbon content\u2014a carburization process was used. Iron billets were heated with charcoal in sealed clay pots that were placed in large bottle-shaped kilns holding about 10 to 14 tons of metal and about 2 tons of charcoal. When the kiln was heated, carbon from the charcoal diffused into the iron.",

      "occurred in 1751, when Benjamin Huntsman established a steelworks at Sheffield, Eng., where the steel was made by melting blister steel in clay crucibles at a temperature of 1,500\u00b0 to 1,600\u00b0 C (2,700\u00b0 to 2,900\u00b0 F), using coke as a fuel. Originally, the charge in the crucible weighed about 6 kilograms, but by 1870 it had increased to 30 kilograms, which, with a crucible weight of 10 kilograms, was the maximum a man could be expected to lift from a hot furnace. The liquid metal was cast to give an ingot about 75 millimetres in square section and 500 millimetres long, but multiple casts were also made. Sheffield became the centre of crucible steel production; in 1873, the peak year, output was 110,000 tons\u2014about half the world\u2019s production. The crucible process spread to Sweden and France following the end of the Napoleonic Wars and then to Germany, where it was associated with Alfred Krupp\u2019s works in Essen. A small crucible steelworks was started in Tokyo in 1895, and crucible steel was produced in Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S., from 1860, using a charge of wrought iron and pig iron. The crucible process allowed alloy steels to be produced for the first time, since alloying elements could be added to the molten metal in the crucible, but it went into decline from the early 20th century, as electric-arc furnaces became more widely used. It is believed that the last crucible furnace in Sheffield was operated until 1968. Bulk steel production was made possible by Henry Bessemer in 1855, when he obtained British patents for a pneumatic steelmaking process. (A similar process is said to have been used in the United States by William Kelly in 1851, but it was not patented until 1857.) Bessemer used a pear-shaped vessel lined with ganister, a refractory material containing silica, into which air was blown from the bottom through a charge of molten pig iron. Bessemer realized that the subsequent oxidation of the silicon and carbon in the iron would release heat and that, if a large"

The company\u2019s first conductor,Richard Karpof Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company\u2019s move to Heinz Hall in 1971. In 1983,Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera\u2019s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera.

In 1999, Richard E. Rauh created an endowment at the United Jewish Federation Foundation, and the Western Pennsylvania Jewish Archives was renamed the Rauh Jewish Archives (RJA). In 2004, through an agreement between the Jewish Federation Foundation, the RJA Advisory Committee, and the History Center, the RJA has become a program of the History Center, with the income from the RJA Endowment at the Jewish Federation Foundation has been directed to the History Center to support the work of the RJA.

      "ACT I. While preparing for their wedding, Figaro learns from Susanna that their philandering employer, Count Almaviva, has designs on her. At this news, the servant vows to outwit his master. Before long the scheming Bartolo enters the servants' quarters with his housekeeper, Marcellina, who wants Figaro to marry her to cancel a debt he cannot pay. After Marcellina and Susanna trade insults, the amorous page Cherubino arrives, reveling in his infatuation with all women. He hides when the Count shows up, furious because he caught Cherubino flirting with Barbarina, the gardener's daughter. The Count pursues Susanna but conceals himself when the gossiping music master Don Basilio approaches. The Count steps forward, however, when Basilio suggests that Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Almaviva is enraged further when he discovers Cherubino in the room. Figaro returns with fellow servants, who praise the Count's progressive reform in abolishing the droit de seigneur\u2014the right of a noble to take a manservant's place on his wedding night. Almaviva assigns Cherubino to his regiment in Seville and leaves Figaro to cheer up the unhappy adolescent. ACT II. In her boudoir, the Countess laments her husband's waning love but plots to chasten him, encouraged by Figaro and Susanna. They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a romantic assignation with the Count. Cherubino, smitten with the Countess, appears, and the two women begin to dress the page for his farcical rendezvous. While Susanna goes out to find a ribbon, the Count knocks at the door, furious to find it locked. Cherubino quickly hides in a closet, and the Countess admits her husband, who, when he hears a noise, is skeptical of her story that Susanna is inside the wardrobe. He takes his wife to fetch some tools with which to force the closet door. Meanwhile, Susanna, having observed everything from behind a screen, helps Cherubino out a window, then takes his place in the closet. Both Count and Countess",

    "context": [
      "Museum: The_Andy_Warhol_Museum",
      "\u201cThe reason I\u2019m painting this way,\u201d Andy Warhol famously told ARTnews in 1962, \u201cis that I want to be a machine.\u201d The machine-like method he was referring to is photographic silkscreen printing, a process that allowed him to quickly reproduce images en masse. For his iconic Flowers series, Warhol set his sights on a photograph of four hibiscus flowers in Modern Photography magazine taken by Patricia Caulfield. Changing its contrast and cropping the image into a square format, Warhol sent it to a commercial silkscreen maker with exacting specifications. Then, with the help of assistants, he copied it across more than 500 canvases, methodically producing paintings in different sizes\u2014mirroring the options of small, medium, large, and extra-large in consumer culture\u2014but with each new reproduction he would apply his own signature style. Caulfield was not amused. She sued Warhol but ultimately settled out of court for a reported $6,000, two paintings, and future royalties. When the canvases were exhibited in Paris and New York in 1964 and 1965, Warhol exploited the serial arrangement and variation in the series by responding to the architecture of each gallery and installing the works in floor-to-ceiling grids, resulting in an immersive environment. Storyteller by Helen Cordero",
      "\u00a9 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. Andy Warhol\u2019s Amiga Digital Art\n\nIn 1985, the electronics company Commodore introduced the world to the then-revolutionary Amiga 1000 personal computer. Amid great fanfare that featured a full orchestra and tuxedo-clad employees, the PC took center stage at New York City\u2019s Lincoln Center, accompanied by two revolutionaries in their own right\u2014Andy Warhol and Blondie\u2019s Debbie Harry. Never one to miss an opportunity to explore uncharted media, Warhol eagerly took on his new role as a Commodore brand ambassador. His assignment that day: Use the Amiga\u2019s ProPaint software to create a portrait of Harry in real time in front of a live audience. Warhol accomplished that goal, and more. For decades, 28 of his digital works\u2014among them, two self-portraits and the untitled renderings of a banana and Campbell\u2019s soup can\u2014existed only on floppy disks stored within The Warhol\u2019s archives. Then in 2014, the museum, artist Cory Arcangel, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s computer club set out to rescue the paintings from their decadeslong purgatory. After painstakingly reverse-engineering the program, the CMU squad revived Warhol\u2019s digital images. In May 2021, five of them were minted and auctioned as nonfungible tokens by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. and Christie\u2019s.",
      "Statue of Jesus by Andy Warhol\n\nNot long after Andy Warhol\u2019s passing, staff at The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (and, upon its founding in 1994, The Andy Warhol Museum) started sorting through and cataloging the many things Warhol left behind, including his 610 Time Capsules . Most of the Time Capsules are cardboard boxes filled with newspaper clippings, day planners, bills, ticket stubs, handwritten letters\u2014life\u2019s detritus. Stashed inside them is no shortage of material clues of the artist\u2019s Byzantine Catholic influences, including family prayer books and prayer cards, souvenirs from Pope Paul VI\u2019s 1965 visit to New York City, and mementos from Warhol\u2019s 1980 visit to the Vatican, where he met Pope John Paul II in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Many of these deeply personal items were on display for the first time in The Warhol\u2019s 2019 exhibition Andy Warhol: Revelation , which explored the connection between Catholicism and the artist\u2019s body of work. A very special addition, on loan from the John Warhola family, was this chalkware plaster statue of Jesus that Warhol painted when he was between 10 and 13 years old, taking great care to detail the crucifixion wounds on the hands of Christ and color the Sacred Heart a deep red.

      "Andy Warhol\u2019s Movie Star Scrapbook\n\nLike a lot of kids growing up during the Great Depression and World War II, Warhola brothers Paul, John, and Andy would find refuge in the three movie theaters near their South Oakland home. Paying a nickel or two, they knew that as soon as the lights dimmed the screen would be illuminated with the celebrities of the day\u2014Joan Crawford, Henry Fonda, Jane Russell, and Mae West among them. Andy was particularly star-struck. He convinced Paul to write letters requesting signed photos, and Andy would meticulously add every new arrival to his rapidly expanding scrapbook."

They left with a dark and foreboding image baked into their brains, painted in 1950 by the museum\u2019s chief artist, Ottmar von Fuehrer. The floor-to-ceiling mural took the Carnegie Tech-trained artist months to complete, and museum visitors got to watch as the depiction of the fierce creature took shape. Part T. rex , part Godzilla, the lumbering dinosaur was based on the science of the day. Later that century, scientists learned that T. rex moved with its back held almost horizontal, with its powerful jaws just a few feet above eye level and its tail raised well off the ground. So, von Fuehrer\u2019s mural had to go. But his work is still on view today\u2014from the painting of Mt.",

      "His 1998 trip to the Estancia Laguna Palacios was Lamanna\u2019s first international dinosaur expedition, and one that was transformative for him, personally and professionally. He developed deep friendships with the Argentinian paleontologists he worked with and began a scientific collaboration that has helped shape his career. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers,\u201d Lamanna said of his Argentinian colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m very much a guest on their project.

      "Fortunately, one of Carnegie\u2019s hired fossil hunters, Bill Reed, knew his stuff and ultimately guided the expedition to another place in southeastern Wyoming known as Sheep Creek. In early July 1899, the crew stumbled upon a massive, nearly complete sauropod (long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur) skeleton. \u201cAround 150 million years ago, sauropods lived on every continent except possibly Antarctica. They ranged in weight from that of a horse all the way up to a sperm whale,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cThey were the largest plant-eating animals in a lot of the environments that they existed in. \u201cIn other words, [the team] had effectively found exactly what Andrew Carnegie was looking for.\u201d\n\nThe crew then spent the rest of the summer carefully extracting sauropod fossils and sending them back to Pittsburgh, where more experts busily cleaned rock off the bones and prepared them for display. What\u2019s even better is that the following summer, another Carnegie expedition returned to the same site and turned up yet another sauropod right next to the first. This was huge for two reasons. First, it allowed the scientists to compare the overlapping bones of the two skeletons and determine that they were mostly identical, which means the specimens belonged to the same, as-of-yet-undiscovered species. Second, having two partial skeletons allowed them to create a single composite mount that was nearly 100 percent complete\u2014something that is basically unheard of for an animal roughly the size of three African elephants put together. In 1901, the museum\u2019s paleontologist, John Bell Hatcher, made everything official by publishing a monograph that denoted the first skeleton as the \u201cholotype\u201d\u2014or the specimen used to describe a species for the first time. In the same study, it got its official name. \u201cAnd so Diplodocus carnegii came into being,\u201d says Lamanna. For most fossils, this would be the end of the story. But for Diplodocus carnegii , the adventures were just beginning.",
      "In its wonderfully creepy Alcohol House, Carnegie Museum of Natural History boasts about 230,000 reptiles and amphibians from 160 countries\u201495% of them fluid-preserved in jars. Each is a scientific time capsule, which is why researchers across the globe use them to study the ecology and evolution of species and their environments. Jennifer Sheridan, curator of amphibians and reptiles at the museum, recalls sleuthing for specimens from Southeast Asia when she came across a common snake known as Rhabdophis subminiatus (or red-necked keelback), that hailed from an uncommon locality\u2014Java, Indonesia. \u201cThe exact location detail is what caught my eye,\u201d Sheridan notes; \u201cthe island of Ternate, where British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was when he wrote his famous letter to Charles Darwin in 1858, explaining to Darwin his idea of evolution by natural selection.\u201d While traveling across Indonesia, Wallace had noticed a distinct change in the species of plants and animals found in two neighboring island groupings. Darwin would later jointly publish his own work on the topic alongside Wallace\u2019s. While the date of the specimen, 1872, is 10 years shy of being linked to Wallace\u2019s work on the island (he left a decade earlier), it\u2019s among the oldest in the museum\u2019s collection.

      "Statue of Jesus by Andy Warhol\n\nNot long after Andy Warhol\u2019s passing, staff at The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (and, upon its founding in 1994, The Andy Warhol Museum) started sorting through and cataloging the many things Warhol left behind, including his 610 Time Capsules . Most of the Time Capsules are cardboard boxes filled with newspaper clippings, day planners, bills, ticket stubs, handwritten letters\u2014life\u2019s detritus. Stashed inside them is no shortage of material clues of the artist\u2019s Byzantine Catholic influences, including family prayer books and prayer cards, souvenirs from Pope Paul VI\u2019s 1965 visit to New York City, and mementos from Warhol\u2019s 1980 visit to the Vatican, where he met Pope John Paul II in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Many of these deeply personal items were on display for the first time in The Warhol\u2019s 2019 exhibition Andy Warhol: Revelation , which explored the connection between Catholicism and the artist\u2019s body of work. A very special addition, on loan from the John Warhola family, was this chalkware plaster statue of Jesus that Warhol painted when he was between 10 and 13 years old, taking great care to detail the crucifixion wounds on the hands of Christ and color the Sacred Heart a deep red.

    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

      "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment",
      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.

      "Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum. Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing centre for the Federal government during the Civil War , under the charge of William Metcalf . Museum [ edit ] Main article: Point State Park Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources , announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination. Plans for improving the park are well underway. They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs.",

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]",
      "New immigrants and migrants\n\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire.",

      "Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]\n\nEuropeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000\u00a0acres (800\u00a0km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130\u00a0km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt.",

      "Tazewell: \"Blue is an intimate portrayal of a Black family living in Harlem, whose world is ripped apart when they become victims of a gross injustice. The opera exposes the systemic racism that seeps into everyday American life like poison, and reminds audiences that police brutality headlines come with a lot of pain and suffering that doesn\u2019t just end when replaced with the latest breaking news. Blue is a story that needs to be told in the opera world. It is so important for all of us to see operas that don\u2019t necessarily reflect our own personal experiences. In this way, we may surprise ourselves by detecting relatable elements \u2013 or if there are none, we can ask ourselves what we have learned from this story.\u201d\n\nJeanine: Our objective is to challenge audience assumptions by going against the grain. For instance, Blue opens with a very pared-down scene, in which an African American man stands in silence before the audience. It is important to me to challenge a viewer\u2019s expectations, but it is equally imperative that I do so in a manner that lets the audience draw their own conclusions, without being told which direction to head in. This is true of music as well: most people observing a large choir of black singers in a church, will expect to hear gospel \u2013 but this was not Tazewell's experience. I therefore decided to compose hymn-like chorales and choral music, that generally do not rely on counterpoint, but are more about singing together collectively in harmony. We did not want to depict the church as a brick building, but rather as a warm and loving community that \u2013 when united in song \u2013 has a similar effect to a hug in that it gets you through hard times.\u201d",

      "Gathering Information 1. Suspected violations should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within one to two weeks of discovering the alleged violation. 2. Instructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation(s) and provide the student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in person meeting or by phone or videoconference as circumstances warrant. 3. Course instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, faculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation(s) under review.

When discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors should avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in order to determine responsibility. 5. If a student does not respond to notification of an alleged violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity, the matter may be reviewed in their absence by the course instructor after a reasonable period of time. In these circumstances, the course instructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome. Determining Responsibility and Course-Level Action 1.

When questions arise as to whether such decisions distribute benefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such decisions should be conducted. The power that teachers wield in the classroom must be exercised with the greatest possible care for maintaining fairness, which means examining classroom practice for any hidden assumptions which might produce confusion or partiality. It also means that we describe to students what the expected commitment for a learning environment is and how to deal with conflicts of commitment, for example time management problems, as they arise.

      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.

During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment"

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]",

      "We have a really great bunch of people, not only in the office but out in the streets, which makes the job much easier. It\u2019s a great dedication we have in EMS, with everybody doing what\u2019s right for the mission.\u201d\n\nChief Farrow started working with Pittsburgh EMS on June 16, 1975. His institutional knowledge and his patient and nurturing leadership style will be missed, city officials said. \"Bob Farrow personifies public service,\u201d Mayor William Peduto said. \u201cHe was the youngest medic on the job when he started in 1975, worked his way up the ranks, and held every position in the\u00a0bureau. His amazing career mirrors the proud history of Pittsburgh's Emergency Medical Services corps.\u201d\n\nPublic Safety Director Wendell Hissrich once served under the leadership of Chief Farrow. Hissrich worked for EMS, as a Paramedic and Crew Chief, from 1985 to 1990 before starting a 25-year career with the FBI. He said Farrow was always calm in the face of chaos, and served as a mentor to countless first responders. \u201cChief Farrow was my one of my first immediate supervisors in my public safety career of 40 years,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cHe still ranks as one of my most-respected supervisors. His knowledge, fairness and calmness during times of chaos exemplifies leadership qualities that should be replicated by all in public safety. \u201cYou always remember the good ones and Bob was one of the best. That includes the FBI and (Pittsburgh) Public Safety. \u2026 He gets the job done and is well-respected. He will be a big loss.\u201d\n\nMayor Peduto has named Ronald Romano acting EMS Chief. Romano, 61, of Stanton Heights, started working for Pittsburgh EMS on March 27, 1978. The City of Pittsburgh thanks Chief Farrow for his four-plus decades of exemplary service. This is a test.",
      "Officer Hall was in Homewood visiting friends when the shooting occurred. Officer Hall, 36, remains in critical condition. We ask that the media and public respect his family\u2019s privacy while Officer Hall fights for his life. The family has asked that the media not contact them at this time. While the Bureau is deeply affected by Officer Hall\u2019s shooting, it is important to note that the overnight hours of July 13-14 resulted in multiple other victims of senseless gun violence, none of whom should be overlooked or forgotten. In addition to the Monticello Street shooting, one person was shot and critically injured during a music concert at Nova Place, and two people were shot in Northview Heights, leaving one victim in critical condition. Police are actively investigating those shootings as well. Our primary directive as a Bureau is to eliminate violent crime.",

You worked incredibly hard to try to save his life, and for that we will be forever grateful. \u201cWe would like to thank all of officer Hall\u2019s extended family -- the men and women in blue. Your support, love, and kind words will be imprinted on our hearts forever. \u201cTo Mayor William Peduto, thank you for all of your love and support. \u201cTo Police Chief Scott Schubert, the support you and your officers have shown to Officer Hall and our family was above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you. \u201cWe also want to thank Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland and Sgt. Joe Lewis, who was Officer Hall\u2019s supervisor at Northview Heights, for your care and compassion. We will never forget all that you have done. \u201cWe want to thank everyone at the Northview Heights Public Safety Center. Officer Hall was so proud to be a part of a unit that was truly making a difference in the community. He spoke of his fellow officers and the substation often. We will not forget you. \u201cTo Officer Hall\u2019s partner, Officer Reggie Eiland, there are no words that can adequately describe how grateful we are for the love, dedication and loyalty that you showed your fellow officer. You never left his side. You were there day and night, as were as so many other officers. We thank you, Officer Reggie, we thank you, Officer Joe Bucci, and we thank every other officer who showed their support, including the Chief of Police in Braddock, where Officer Hall worked before he came to Pittsburgh, who was there to support him and to offer his prayers. \u201cThere are so many others we want to thank, including those whose names we never learned. If we have forgotten anyone, please forgive us. But know that your kindness and devotion did not go unrecognized. We thank you all for working around the clock to support officer Hall and his family.\u201d"

      "Since its launch in May of this year, Books Bridge Hope has distributed more than 50 boxes of goodness in partnership with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its 25-member-strong team of Community Engagement officers. Officers now have the boxes in their vehicles to hand out to people where needed. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate reality, but Pittsburgh Police encounter our unsheltered community members throughout the City every single day, many of whom our officers know by name and try to assist with their differing and varying needs. But, sometimes receiving a gift; a surprise box full of items that lift a person\u2019s soul and makes them smile, is just as important as helping provide some of the other critical care and assistance people need. That\u2019s why the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office jumped at the chance to partner with Books Bridge Hope \u2013 because that\u2019s exactly what they do; they provide hope to those who need it most,\u201d said Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa of the Community Engagement Office. Leonardi, who has personally funded the initiative since its inception, also works with an impassioned network of volunteers who help source and assemble contents for each box. Each Box of Goodness is filled to the brim with books, magazines, and writing supplies in direct response to countless requests for reading materials that help fill the long, empty hours on the street or in a shelter. Warm socks, toiletries and non-perishable food are also included. \u201cThis initiative not only provides compassionate care to the unsheltered community during these unprecedented times, but also allows law enforcement, the Books Bridge Hope Board of Directors, community collaborators, and volunteers to bring forth their best efforts in service to others,\" said Leonardi. To learn more about Books Bridge Hope and its Box of Goodness initiative, visit passagesandprose.com/pages/books-bridge-hope or\u00a0contact founder, Lillie Leonardi, at authorlillieleonardi@gmail.com",
      "Also receiving grants were: Moon Volunteer Fire Department, which received equipment for its rescue truck valued at $12,803; North Fayette Township Volunteer Fire Department, which received a gear washer valued at $11,519; and West Deer Volunteer Fire Company #2, which received a brush skid unit valued at $11,090. \u201cWe want to thank our\u00a0donors who help us provide these lifesaving tools,\u201d said Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation Executive Director Robin Peters. \u201cOur first responders are our heroes and we want to be sure they have the tools and technology they need to protect their communities.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich attended the grant ceremony today at the Firehouse Subs in Robinson Town Centre with Morello, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert and Assistant Public Safety Director\u00a0Shatara Murphy. Hissrich noted that the grant allows Public Safety to allocate $18,922 to other pressing needs, and called the grant \u201cincredibly valuable and important.\u201d\n\nFirehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was created in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Firehouse Subs founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen, travelled to Mississippi to provide food to first responders and hurricane survivors. Certain they could do more, they started Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation with the mission of providing funding, lifesaving equipment and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety departments. The non-profit has granted more than $35 million to organizations in 47 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, including $581,000 in Pennsylvania, since its inception.

      "In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125]\n\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127]\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation.

      "Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226]\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230]\n\nSome people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories \"police budget cost per person,\" \"fines / forefeitures,\" \"Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),\" \"Force Used per Arrest,\" \"Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,\" \"Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,\" \"Discrimination Complaints Upheld,\" \"Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,\" \"Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,\" and \"Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.\" This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231]\n\nEducation\n\nColleges and universities",

The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services."

Hissrich noted that the grant allows Public Safety to allocate $18,922 to other pressing needs, and called the grant \u201cincredibly valuable and important.\u201d\n\nFirehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was created in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Firehouse Subs founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen, travelled to Mississippi to provide food to first responders and hurricane survivors. Certain they could do more, they started Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation with the mission of providing funding, lifesaving equipment and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety departments. The non-profit has granted more than $35 million to organizations in 47 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, including $581,000 in Pennsylvania, since its inception.

PITTSBURGH, PA (March 5, 2021)\u2014The Office of Mayor William Peduto, Pittsburgh Public Safety and the Office of Community Health and Safety announce the creation of the Opioid Overdose Dashboard , a\u00a0public\u00a0tool that will help form and guide\u00a0policies and programs to more effectively address unsafe opioid use in the City of Pittsburgh. Opioid Overdose Dashboard: https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/overdose-dashboard\n\nThe dashboard compiles Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS data to map monthly opioid overdose calls and Public Safety\u2019s response. Data will include the number of people who overdose, neighborhood-level mapping, demographic information, and other statistics regarding care provided by on-scene\u00a0First Responders. \"While this is a data-driven initiative, it's really about using all the resources at the City's disposal into giving our residents a helping hand. That means cross-department coordination, best practices in care and support, and now a Dashboard to help guide our work as effectively as possible,\" Mayor William Peduto said. First Responders, to include Pittsburgh EMS, Fire and Police, respond to drug overdoses and have saved many lives through their training and the use of Narcan and CPR, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. \u201cAnd they will continue to save lives,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cBut to more effectively address the root of the problem, everyone must join together. Having more data will lead to a better understanding of the issues and, hopefully, actionable solutions.\u201d",

      "world. Sports that originally began elsewhere, such as tennis (which comes from Renaissance France), were modernized and exported as if they too were raw materials imported for British industry to transform and then export as finished goods. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the British expelled the French from Canada and from India and extended British rule over much of Africa. To the ends of the earth, cricket followed the Union Jack, which explains the game\u2019s current popularity in Australia, South Asia, and the West Indies. Rugby football flourishes in other postcolonial cultures, such as New Zealand and South Africa, where the British once ruled. It was, however, association football\u2019s destiny to become the world\u2019s most widely played modern sport. Cricket and rugby seemed to require British rule in order to take root. Football needed only the presence of British economic and cultural influence. In Buenos Aires, for instance, British residents founded clubs for cricket and a dozen other sports, but it was the Buenos Aires Football Club, founded June 20, 1867, that kindled Argentine passions. In almost every instance, the first to adopt football were the cosmopolitan sons of local elites, many of whom had been sent to British schools by their Anglophile parents. Seeking status as well as diversion, middle-class employees of British firms followed the upper-class lead. From the gamut of games played by the upper and middle classes, the industrial workers of Europe and Latin America, like the indigenous population of Africa, appropriated football as their own. By the late 19th century, the United States had begun to rival Great Britain as an industrial power and as an inventor of modern sports. Enthusiasts of baseball denied its origins in British children\u2019s games such as cat and rounders and concocted the myth of Abner Doubleday, who allegedly invented the game in 1839 in Cooperstown, New York.

      "That she did. Much of the construction of the new headquarters took place during the pandemic, causing delays and issues they never could have imagined. But she kept things moving forward and always kept the focus on the kids they serve. \"When I first started, I never thought in a million years that we would have our first building that we were in because I used to do it out of my home,\" said Wilson-Batch. \"Then we found the place in Homestead, a former doctor's office, and turned it into our headquarters. Again, never in a million years did I think we would go from 5,300 square feet to 33,000 square feet. \"Going through construction during the pandemic, when you get shutdown for 62 days and then you get hit with supply chain issues. And then stuff got stuck with the situation in the Suez Canal when a ship was stuck there. And there were price increases from the time we started until we finished on goods that were needed. I kept thinking, is this really going to happen.\"\n\nIt was her diligence, her never taking no for an answer, never letting a setback stop them, that got them to the finish line, while never missing a beat serving the kids in the community. \"A day after the ribbon cutting, when everything was cleaned up and back to normal, I went into the gym at six in the morning when I normally get to work,\" said Wilson-Batch. \"It was still dark, and I went to the gym, and I laid in the middle of the floor on the logo, and I cried. And I still get emotional about it.\"\n\nAfter a brief pause to get her thoughts together again, she continued, showing the passion she has for the foundation. \"I was just thinking, God, we did it,\" said Wilson-Batch. \"I remember when I was standing right there, and it was just dirt. And to be able to take a moment to think about the laughter of the kids, the smiles and a safe place for them to be. \"(Charlie) and I used to say, if we don't do this, who will.",
      "Anderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is. \"I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger,\" said Anderson. \"So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time.\"\n\nSpencer Anderson Cause: Autism Speaks\n\nSpencer Anderson's heart told him that the cause he chose for his cleats as a part of My Cause My Cleats was the right choice to make. While it's nothing that has touched his family directly, it has impacted several people close to him and that is why he selected Autism Speaks to represent with his cleats. \"I feel like it's one of those things that isn't talked about often enough,\" said Anderson. \"One of my close friends is autistic. I have known a lot of people growing up that were autistic. I feel like a lot of people don't understand. It's kind of frowned upon. People will whisper, will say he has autism you have to be easy with him. \"They are normal people. I have interacted with many of them. It's not talked about enough. The cases aren't as common as cancer, mental health, but it's something people should be aware of. \"I have a close family friend, a friend of my mom's, and she has a son who has been autistic his whole life. Interacting with him you know they are real people, they interact normally. They have their moments, but they can do good in society and in the world. It's not something that they should be looked down upon, or shunned, or turn a cold shoulder.\"",

This groundbreaking program would provide significant relief to long-term homeowners in neighborhoods experiencing rapid property value increases, preventing the displacement of those who have invested in and nurtured their communities. If adopted by Council, the LOOP program would ensure that Pittsburgh residents who have contributed to the character and vibrancy of their neighborhoods will be able to continue living in the homes they\u2019ve cherished, despite the pressures of development on property values. \u201cI\u2019m proud to submit this legislation that will help keep people in the houses they made into homes,\u201d said Mayor Ed Gainey. \u201cNo resident should be forced out of their neighborhood due to development, and LOOP is an important step toward ensuring that Pittsburgh\u2019s residents can continue to call their communities home.\u201d\n\nThe LOOP program offers tax relief to homeowners in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods by exempting or deferring property tax increases for those who meet specific eligibility criteria. This includes homeowners who have lived in their property for at least ten continuous years, or five years if they\u2019ve received assistance from a government or nonprofit housing program. Additional eligibility factors include the increase in property assessment value, household income level, and the timeliness of tax payments. Key Eligibility Requirements for LOOP:",

      "Professional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937\u201345 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947\u201348 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961\u201363), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970\u201372), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004\u201308) and Phantoms (2009\u201310) both of the ABA. Three Pittsburgh universities, the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and Robert Morris University, compete in NCAA Division I basketball. Pitt and Duquesne are the traditional basketball powers in the city, but all three universities have made multiple appearances in the National Invitation Tournament and NCAA tournament. Pitt won two pre-NCAA tournament National Championships in 1928 and 1930[215] while Duquesne won the NIT title in 1955, its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Both Pitt and Duquesne have reached the NCAA tournament Final Four once, Duquesne in 1940 and Pitt in 1941. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. Soccer\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Riverhounds play their home games at Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[citation needed]\n\nGolf",

The School of Medicine, originally chartered in 1886 as the Western Pennsylvania Medical College, joined the university in 1892. The school\u2019s name was changed to the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. The central feature of the main campus is its Cathedral of Learning, a 42-story Gothic skyscraper. Notable alumni include dancer Gene Kelly, filmmaker Werner Herzog, and philanthropist Andrew Mellon. Jonas Salk conducted his polio-vaccine research while on the medical school faculty.",

This groundbreaking program would provide significant relief to long-term homeowners in neighborhoods experiencing rapid property value increases, preventing the displacement of those who have invested in and nurtured their communities. If adopted by Council, the LOOP program would ensure that Pittsburgh residents who have contributed to the character and vibrancy of their neighborhoods will be able to continue living in the homes they\u2019ve cherished, despite the pressures of development on property values. \u201cI\u2019m proud to submit this legislation that will help keep people in the houses they made into homes,\u201d said Mayor Ed Gainey. \u201cNo resident should be forced out of their neighborhood due to development, and LOOP is an important step toward ensuring that Pittsburgh\u2019s residents can continue to call their communities home.\u201d\n\nThe LOOP program offers tax relief to homeowners in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods by exempting or deferring property tax increases for those who meet specific eligibility criteria. This includes homeowners who have lived in their property for at least ten continuous years, or five years if they\u2019ve received assistance from a government or nonprofit housing program. Additional eligibility factors include the increase in property assessment value, household income level, and the timeliness of tax payments. Key Eligibility Requirements for LOOP:",

In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230]\n\nSome people do not believe these efforts to be adequate.

One\n\ncomponent of the American Rescue Plan allocated $350 billion to eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal\n\ngovernments to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. The City of Pittsburgh received an allocation totaling\n\n$335,070,222 from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (CSLFRF). The first tranche was\n\nreceived in June 2021; the second and final tranche was received in June 2022. These funds may used in one of the following four statutory categories:\n\n1. To respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative economic impacts;\n\n2. To respond to workers performing essential work during the COVID-19 public health emergency by\n\nproviding premium pay to such eligible workers of the recipient, or by providing grants to eligible\n\nemployers that have eligible workers who performed essential work;\n\n3. For the provision of government services, to the extent of the reduction in revenue of such recipient due\n\nto the COVID\u201319 public health emergency, relative to revenues collected in the most recent full fiscal year\n\nof the recipient prior to the emergency; and\n\n4.

      "The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City\u2019s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate,\n\nand foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through\n\ncloseout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City\u2019s exposure to any grant-related legal liability,\n\nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars. The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to\n\nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City\u2019s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant\n\nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our\n\ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain\n\ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed\n\nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services,\n\nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows\n\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the\n\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant. In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding.

      "## Youth-Civic-Leadership-Academy.txt\n\nIn This Section\n\nThe Youth Civic Leadership Academy (YCLA) helps youth do the heavy lifting emerging adulthood requires by equipping youth with transferable skills, competencies, and experiential learning necessary to thrive as civic leaders, community stewards, and change-makers in the workplace and beyond. YCLA will provide opportunities for youth to access, explore, and experience career fields typically deemed off-limits for youth of color and those without significant monetary and social capital within Pittsburgh including decision-making fields like civics, education, and infrastructure. Through a 3 phased experiential learning and project-based approach, YCLA will equip youth with insights into Pittsburgh\u2019s past, resources of the present, and the vision of Pittsburgh's future with the mayor being a direct mentor committed to imbuing youth with a sense of belonging and relevant regional identity. Beyond a transactional or removed level of engagement merely informing youth that certain career fields exist,\n\nYCLA provides a literal one-of-a-kind immersive and integrative experience made possible through the leadership of the City of Pittsburgh Office of the Mayor and supporting partners-the Community College of Allegheny County, the Heinz History Center, Partner4Work, and Youth Enrichment Services, Inc. (YES) YCLA scholars will not only see themselves as capable of having a career but also as being a part of Pittsburgh\u2019s career ecosystem. Youth will earn college credit through a partnership with CCAC and be enrolled in a course that is specially designed to support their civic competency but also exposure to city departments in hopes to obtain a job given their area of interest. They will be able to participate in a circuit-style internship experience over the 11 weeks in the program.

For me it was amazing and touching because I already had every one of these students in my previous class. So, to watch them develop within a year, a year and a half time and to see the thought process and how they're thinking outside the box, it gave me hope for the future.

The new Public Safety Center -- which will serve residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings -- is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them. Tomorrow\u2019s Open House event will provide the public with a first glimpse inside the facility --\u00a0where residents will have access to job training, arts programs, and shared community space -- plus an opportunity to hear from City officials, community leaders\u00a0and Northview Heights residents on their hopes for the Safety Center. \u201cThis center is a great model of many different partners coming together for a common good, one that delivers equity and quality of life for all,\u201d Mayor William Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich credited the many partners who came together on this project, including the Housing Authority and Executive Director Caster D. Binion. \u201cWe worked closely on this important project, one which will result in improved police-community relations, more opportunities for residents and a safer environment for all,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cWe have seen great success with the opening of the Downtown substation, and we expect to replicate that success with the Northview Heights Public Safety Center.\u201d",

This isn\u2019t just a warm hand off. The office is dedicated to the victim and their family and will be by their side throughout the process. When Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich created this office and asked me to manage it, we were clear that we didn\u2019t just want to be another resource. We will serve as a partner to the community and we are committed to that partnership.\u201d\n\nMayor William Peduto said the effort is part of the City\u2019s goal of helping all residents. \"Public Safety provides many services but at the department's heart is one main goal, and that is to be there for people in need of help. Having a coordinator in place whose sole job is providing assistance to victims is a major part of the City's efforts to give help to all, and especially those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Mayor Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he is proud of the work of the Victims Assistance Office, as it speaks to the City- and Department-wide desire to put others first. \u201cPublic Safety is a dynamic department that doesn\u2019t only include First Responders who save lives daily in times of urgency and emergency,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cIt also includes compassionate people who methodically consider the long-term needs of those who need help, and then take steps to provide it.\u201d\n\nAbboud, who started in her position on Aug. 3, 2020, said her goal is to help victims throughout the process, which often means multiple follow-up contacts. \u201cThey need somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to them and say, \u2018I\u2019m here for you."

Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus.

Equity (Show info): https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Glossary/Equity\n\nPDEC has identified four areas of greatest need for digital equity programming and defined equity outcomes for each goal. In their final report, due this summer, PDEC will provide specific recommendations to address each of the four areas. According to the latest available release of American Community Survey data:\n\nLocal surveys, national surveys, and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that affordability is the biggest reason households do not subscribe to broadband, and a lack of understanding for how to use a computer is a major contributing factor. Additionally, a 2022 Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission report on Equitable Broadband Access indicates that Seniors, Families with K-12 students, and Black citizens are disproportionately disconnected, and efforts should be taken to help these key populations. A coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions provided the Pittsburgh region with the opportunity to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come. This plan comprehensively addresses the gaps in digital skills, low-cost high-speed internet services, as well as access to devices and technical assistance.

      "1940s\n\nPittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]\n\nPostwar\n\nDavid Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]\n\nRenaissance I (1946\u20131973)\n\nRich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.

During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S.

      "During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop. In 1985, the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.[27] In the 1980s, the \"Renaissance II\" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.[27] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened.[27] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.[93]\n\nAlso in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.[94]\n\nPittsburgh today",

      "Located just a few blocks from PPG Paints Arena, the Ammon Recreation Center has long been a cornerstone of the Hill District, offering sports, educational programs, and a space for community events. Built in the 1940\u2019s on the site of the historic Ammon Field, the facility has provided generations of residents with opportunities to grow, connect, and take pride in their neighborhood. This latest investment builds on the Penguins\u2019 previous $100,000 contribution in 2020, which helped establish a Rec2Tech computer lab to bridge the digital divide for local students and families. The Penguins\u2019 commitment to Ammon is part of a broader strategy to support economic and community development in the region. Over the years, the team has worked with partners to help secure funding for Frankie Pace Park, contribute millions to the Greater Hill District Reinvestment Fund, and allocate significant contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses through major projects like the recently-opened FNB Financial Center and the forthcoming Music Venue development. ================================================================================\n\nURL: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/pittsburgh-pennies-legacy-lives-on\n\nTITLE: Pittsburgh Pennies Legacy Lives On | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nMembers of the original Pittsburgh Pennies, established in 1972 as the city\u2019s first women\u2019s hockey team, were in the building on Sunday for the seventh annual Her Hockey Game presented by 84 Lumber \u2013 which recognized the incredible passion of women fans during the NHL\u2019s Celebrating Women\u2019s History Month.

    "question": "What measures have been implemented in Public Safety to prevent the spread of COVID-19?",
    "context": [
      "Multiple others have been placed in quarantine out of an abundance of caution in order to stop the spread, including about 100 Police officers. \u201cThe number fluctuates daily, but understand that those who are in quarantine are not positive. They are off as a precaution,\u201d Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said Tuesday. \u201cAll but one of the (positive) employees are recuperating at home. One was hospitalized, but has been improving daily. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected.\u201d\n\nPublic Safety\u2019s positive test rates remain significantly lower that what other major city First Responders are experiencing. The low infection rates\u00a0have\u00a0allowed Public Safety to proactively quarantine everyone who was possibly exposed, and to maintain normal staffing levels. \u201cWhen you call 911, rest assured you\u2019re going to get the assistance you need,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going a step above what is required. Our numbers have been so low that we can take these precautions. \u2026 We have to be cautious and we have to make sure our First Responders have the equipment and the training they need to respond to every call.\u201d\n\nSeveral preventative steps are in place across all Public Safety bureaus, and have been since March, including: Mandatory masks and social distancing, daily screenings upon entry to any Public Safety facility, and strict quarantine/isolation procedures. EMS, Fire and Police officials meet daily via Teams Meetings with Director Hissrich and the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth, to discuss the pandemic. EMS has reactivated a second specialized EMS unit with enhanced decontamination capabilities and advanced PPE to respond to suspected Covid cases. \u201cWe\u2019re taking all the precautions we can,\u201d Hissrich said.",
      "\u201cWhile we are pleased that no cases have appeared in this area yet, we will be ready if any cases do appear here. We prepare for any and all types of threats, whether it be flooding concerns, large snowfalls, extreme heat, large gatherings in the city or Presidential and dignitary visits. We always prepare, and we\u2019ll be prepared for this as well.\u201d\n\nFor more information on national efforts to address the Coronavirus, go to www.cdc.gov. www.cdc.gov.: http://www.cdc.gov/\n\n(First Responder Personal Protection Kits)",
      "Please remember to look before you lock,\u201d Hissrich said. And finally, although the situation has vastly improved, the pandemic is not over. Those who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a mask. Even though the activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines. \u201cThis will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That\u2019s what people do during holidays.",

      "Such ceremonies typically occur in Council Chambers at the City-County Building. They were moved to the Convention Center to accommodate Covid-19 safety measures. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 5, 2021)\u2014The Office of Mayor William Peduto, Pittsburgh Public Safety and the Office of Community Health and Safety announce the creation of the Opioid Overdose Dashboard , a\u00a0public\u00a0tool that will help form and guide\u00a0policies and programs to more effectively address unsafe opioid use in the City of Pittsburgh. Opioid Overdose Dashboard: https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/overdose-dashboard\n\nThe dashboard compiles Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS data to map monthly opioid overdose calls and Public Safety\u2019s response. Data will include the number of people who overdose, neighborhood-level mapping, demographic information, and other statistics regarding care provided by on-scene\u00a0First Responders. \"While this is a data-driven initiative, it's really about using all the resources at the City's disposal into giving our residents a helping hand. That means cross-department coordination, best practices in care and support, and now a Dashboard to help guide our work as effectively as possible,\" Mayor William Peduto said. First Responders, to include Pittsburgh EMS, Fire and Police, respond to drug overdoses and have saved many lives through their training and the use of Narcan and CPR, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. \u201cAnd they will continue to save lives,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cBut to more effectively address the root of the problem, everyone must join together. Having more data will lead to a better understanding of the issues and, hopefully, actionable solutions.\u201d",
      "\"This event is so fun. Just to have an event this fun and offer it as a night of enjoyment for our region to come together and celebrate all that people in our community have accomplished establishing resiliency, it's just incredible.\"\n\nThe vision of the Neighborhood Resilience Project is to inspire a movement in which suffering people are raised up from the ashes of trauma in unconditional love to become empowered healers, community builders, and positive change makers. The project is rooted in the Gospel and teachings of the Orthodox Church, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. \"This has been a tremendous blessing to us,\" said Rev.",
      "The early church began around the dinner table. We have discovered that this form of worship appeals to some who would like a more casual form of worship, where they can participate in discussion, ask questions and enjoy fellowship in a non-threatening environment. Dinner is delicious and free, but an offering is accepted to continue and support this excellent ministry outside the walls of a church building. 412-384-3630. Food & Drink Event. FREE.
