    "question": "When can students add or drop courses in the summer term according to the academic calendar?",
    "context": [
      "The Winter Break period is not included. Meal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed based upon actual use. There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee. Financial Aid Adjustment Federal and institutional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student earns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is completed. Student grants and non-federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the withdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds. Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy Policy Statement No undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure This policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co- curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students. In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. 113\n\nAs with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions. Any academic or artistic activities which you feel must be scheduled between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m.",
      "Tuition and Fees Adjustment Policy Application This policy applies to withdrawals and leaves of absence by all students (graduate, undergraduate, non-degree) for all semesters (Fall, Spring, Summer 1, Summer 2, Summer All). Official Date of Withdrawal/Leave of Absence For students who notify the University of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of absence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is the earliest of: \u2022 the date the student began the withdrawal or leave of absence process; \u2022 the date the student notified his or her home department; \u2022 the date the student notified the associate dean of his or her college; or \u2022 the date the student notified the dean of students. For students who do not notify the University of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of absence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is: \u2022 the midpoint of the semester; or \u2022 the last date the student attended an academically-related activity such as an exam, tutorial or study group, or the last day a student turned in a class assignment. Tuition Adjustment Students who withdraw or take a leave of absence before completing 60% of the semester will be charged tuition based on the number of days completed within the semester. This includes calendar days, class and non-class days, from the first day of classes to the last day of final exams. Breaks which last five days or longer, including the preceding and subsequent weekends, are not counted. Thanksgiving and Spring Break are not counted. There is no tuition adjustment after 60% of the semester is completed. The tuition adjustment schedule is available on The HUB website. No tuition is charged to a student who is administratively withdrawn. No tuition is charged to a student who is administratively withdrawn. 112\n\nHousing, Meal Plan & Fee Adjustments Housing charges are adjusted daily, beginning on check-in day and ending on the last day of final exams for the semester. Holiday breaks are included.",
      "There should be no expectation that the following points will cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the exam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course syllabus. In order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this document lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. Instructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the course syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the responsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with the instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed. Definitions \u2022 Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). \u2022 Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by the University Registrar's Office. \u2022 Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self-scheduled examinations. \u2022 Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. \u2022 In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as in-term examinations. 43",

      "9\n\nEducational Goals Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Academic and Individual Freedom Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 10",

The histories of their conception, design, and construction are contained in the drawings and other documents shared between clients, architects, and contractors.

      "Online. This is the third workshop in the Neuroinclusive Teaching Series, a joint collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Some, though certainly not all, individuals who identify as neurodivergent experience disability. In this session, Leigh Culley from Pitt\u2019s Disability Resources and Services and Catherine Getchell from CMU\u2019s Office of Disability Resources discuss the reasons why someone who is neurodivergent might experience disability as a result. We will share some common and not-so-common accommodations that may support a neurodivergent student in fully accessing their education, and how instructors and advisors can best support students in connecting students with our offices and implementing approved accommodations.

      "URL: https://www.steelers.com/news/boykin-wants-to-carry-on-the-tradition\n\nCONTENT:\n\nBoykin wants to carry on the tradition\n\nSteelers.com\n\nIn celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today, receiver Miles Boykin shares why Black History Month is important to him and how hearing from those who came before him has inspired and touched him. There are lessons we all learn in life that come from so many sources, but for receiver Miles Boykin, when it comes to Black History Month, there is no greater source than his grandmother, Cornelia Brigmon. \"Black culture is such a part of American culture,\" said Boykin. \"I think we need to relay that to everybody and recognize its importance in the United States today. \"For me, listening to my grandma is one of the best ways to do it. My grandma would always tell me stories. She is turning close to 80-years old now, so she has some crazy stories. She was born during segregation. I can't even remember the whole specifics, but it was her mom or her grandmother who was born a slave and then they were eventually able to leave out of it. Just some of the stories that she tells me really makes me grateful for what I have today and grateful for those who came before me.\"\n\nThe stories, many of which Boykin likes to just keep close to the vest, have been eye-opening for him and given him an even greater appreciation for those who came before him. \"You hear some of the things and it's almost unfathomable, but it seemed so normal to her,\" said Boykin. \"And now, she's just so grateful for everything. I truly think the older people are, the more appreciation they have for a lot of the things they had to go through. That's all we want for anybody. Hopefully when I'm 80-years old, I'll be able to say the same thing to my kids, and my grandkids, that they have been blessed in the world that they live and try to make it better for everybody. \"To me it means everything to hear stories from her because obviously oral history is so much better. The first-hand encounters are better than learning something from a book or watching it on television. Just the little things that my grandma would teach me about how things were when she was growing up. And even when my mom was growing up, how different things kind of were then as opposed to where we are today. \"It's huge to hear the stories because you don't want to forget where we came from.\"\n\nHearing the stories, understanding the struggles his grandmother went through, makes Boykin realize how far the country has come. But he is also aware of how much further we still need to go. \"I think we're always going to be working towards being perfect, because there's no such thing as perfect,\" said Boykin. \"Just seeing how far the needle has moved since then is definitely amazing.\"",

      "They continued the holiday spirit by hosting a toy distribution at Pittsburgh Grandview PreK-5, bringing joy to kids at a time of year when joy should be widespread through a partnership with Toys for Tykes. \"Being able to give a kid a toy that may not have the opportunity to get toys on Christmas, and being able to provide that for them, it's special,\" said Kuntz. \"I know we want to focus on essential needs and things that people need. But just seeing kids smiling, getting toys, it's really exciting. \"The best part of it all is just the kids face and how happy they are when you give them a toy or something. That's the best part about giving back. Just seeing their reaction, the pure joy and the fact that they really need what we are giving them.\"\n\nThey wrapped up their holiday good will by hosting teens from the Foster Love Project to dinner and a night of fun and games at Dave & Busters. The couple also provided gift cards for the kids so they can do some of their own holiday shopping. \"This was fun, and I did my best to not let them win against me,\" said Kuntz. \"I am competitive for sure. But it was fun, being able to enjoy a meal together and then let the kids have fun and play games. \"My foundation, when we started it, our hope was to help the youth.

      "These types of fellowships and internships that are available for everybody to get on the same page, just understand that if you can do the job, then we want you here. We want the best person for the job because that's what we're looking for.\"\n\nKnowing that they are helping to break down some of the barriers in sports is something they don't think about regularly, as they just consider themselves scouts and coaches, not female scouts and coaches. But there is the understanding they are opening doors for others, giving those after them the opportunity to reach their goals because the standard is now set. \"Representation matters,\" said Brown. \"Whenever you see somebody who looks like you, regardless of it's race or gender, background, then you feel hopeful.

      "To that end, we are\n\nuseums chose to feature the contributions of white committed to doing the following:\n\n6. The Frick Pittsburgh will\n\nconsult with Black\n\nstakeholders and people\n\nof color to learn about and\n\nrepresent the interests of\n\ndiverse audiences in our\n\nexhibitions, educational\n\nprograms, communications,\n\nmuseum store, and food\n\nservices. 7. The Frick Pittsburgh will expand our\n\nprofessional networks to include diverse\n\norganizations, such as the African American\n\nChamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania,\n\nwhich can help us expand our partnerships,\n\naudiences, and applicant pools. 8. We pledge to develop strategies to diversify\n\nour leadership and board within the period\n\ncovered by our Strategic Plan (2020-2027). ten weeks after making these\n\ncommitments, the Frick has embarked\n\non the journey to honor them. We began with an informal  listening session with\n\nour staff, at which we were joined by Cecile Shellman,\n\nour DEAI consultant, and Jane Zwier, a licensed\n\nprofessional counselor with  our Employee\n\nAssistance Program. Next, our entire staff completed virtual seminars on\n\nthe subject of empathy, followed by online classes in\n\nverbal conflict de-escalation techniques\u2014\n\nopportunities that have empowered us to approach all\n\ninteractions with compassion and clear\n\ncommunication. Our DEAI committee, formed in 2019 under the\n\nleadership of interim director Judith Hansen O\u2019Toole,\n\nis finalizing a charter structuring its ongoing work\n\nand its members\u2019 terms of service. The committee\n\nhas laid out a robust schedule of projects, including an\n\nall-employee virtual anti-racism workshop in September. Our Board of Trustees has met twice with the Frick\u2019s\n\nDEAI consultant, first to review plans and progress and\n\nthen to participate in an anti-racism workshop. Our Learning & Visitor Experience department is\n\ncontinuing to expand our educational community\n\npartnerships. In August, we welcomed to our campus\n\na group of socially distanced summer campers from\n\nSouth Pittsburgh\u2019s youth anti-violence organization\n\nVoices Against Violence to create an anti-racist art\n\ninstallation on the Frick grounds. We have begun asking our vendors to share informa-\n\ntion about their diversity and racial equity plans, and\n\nare ensuring that all searches for positions, services,\n\nand suppliers include Black and minority finalists. Our curatorial department is in the throes of developing\n\nThe Frick Reflects exhibition, examining both the social\n\nand art history of our collections and our institution\u2019s\n\nfounding.

Anchoring the program are authors Connie Porter (the ADDY WALKER\u00ae series), Jackie Greene (the REBECCA RUBIN \u2122 series), and Wendy Wan-Long Shang (CORINNE \u00ae series) who will share their experiences writing the powerful narratives of these beloved characters. The trio will discuss how they framed important historical events and issues for younger audiences while also imparting lessons of resilience, friendship, and empowerment throughout. Ahead of the book talk, kids and kids-at-heart are invited (with their dolls!) to an enchanting tea party that Samantha, Molly, and Felicity would be proud of! Enjoy light refreshments and imaginative play while you sip, savor, and socialize. Throughout the day, you can also dip into your own childhood nostalgia and design a paper doll with the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Book Making Club, view girlhood-inspired artifacts in the Detre Library & Archives, learn about the American Girl Doll Lending Program at local libraries, participate in a themed scavenger hunt, and browse the Riverstone Books pop-up shop.

That moment for me, and of course my emotional self, I'm sitting there boo-hooing because he was so proud of his mom. In those moments, when kids are able to be fulfilled, when they're able to have that look on their face of just being a kid, those are the things that I live for. \"It's seeing kids accomplish things they didn't think they could accomplish, things they have never done, and they take it on.

      "166\n\nEqual employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical component of university operations. Responsibility The broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and affirmative action are everyone's responsibility. In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity commitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA). Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include: Farnam Jahanian, president, 412-268-2200 Involved in all queries concerning the application of our non-discrimination policy as it applies to educational programming, and works with the university's Faculty Review Committee to resolve complaints regarding the application of Carnegie Mellon's policies as they apply to faculty.

The university bases its employment decisions on the principle of equal employment opportunity. All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education tuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance with the university's commitment to non\n\ndiscrimination. 165\n\nFurther, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for employment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements are used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and complies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related disability. Reason for the Policy This EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an update on current responsibilities.

      "Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories \"police budget cost per person,\" \"fines / forefeitures,\" \"Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),\" \"Force Used per Arrest,\" \"Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,\" \"Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,\" \"Discrimination Complaints Upheld,\" \"Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,\" \"Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,\" and \"Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.\" This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231]\n\nEducation\n\nColleges and universities\n\nPittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University.

      "9\n\nEducational Goals Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Academic and Individual Freedom Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 10"

The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named \"Win-Win: How to Get What You Want,\" started with Carnegie\u00a0Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful\u00a0\u2014 and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject:Women Don't AskandAsk for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want. In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William \"Red\" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean\u00a0up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.",

The university's official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). \u2022 Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by the University Registrar's Office. \u2022 Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self-scheduled examinations. \u2022 Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. \u2022 In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as in-term examinations. 43",
      "Policies I. In-term Examinations 1. All in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. However, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may be administered outside of regularly scheduled class time. 2. No examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled examinations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time Saturday or Sunday. 3. The instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls outside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an alternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, including those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that the instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner). 4. No student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class examinations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor in a timely manner of his/her circumstance so that appropriate accommodations can be made.",
      "Final Examinations 1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self- scheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. 2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day of classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned. 44\n\n3. No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final examination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final examination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no classes other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. Review sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort should be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio reviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a final examination. 4. Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examinations. 5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 25-hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled within a 25-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should first contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the problem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate dean of his or her home college.",

Upon receipt of a report, the university will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss appropriate Supportive Measures (see Section V.A) and to explain the process for filing a Formal Complaint (see Section VI.A).

Registering can greatly help in retrieving a bicycle or other vehicle in case of theft. It also allows the university to contact the owner for retrieval if the vehicle is parked improperly or abandoned. Parking A personal wheeled vehicle is parked/stored on campus at the risk of its owner. For operators' convenience, bicycle racks are provided at various campus locations. These racks are appropriate for bicycles and other two-wheeled vehicles. Information about using bicycles and wheeled vehicles on campus, including a list of rack locations, can be found on the Transportation Services website. In order to maintain campus accessibility for all users, no wheeled vehicle shall be parked, stored, or left standing in such a manner as to: \u2022 Block entrance to or exit from any building or structure on campus; \u2022 Block outdoor walkways or stairs; \u2022 Impede the movement of persons with disabilities; \u2022 Inhibit the full use of campus infrastructure, such as benches, handrails, ramps, railings, and other such furniture; \u2022 Damage or potentially damage trees, artworks or landscaping; \u2022 Impact any other location in a way that violates federal, state or local fire and safety regulations. Personal wheeled vehicles left in such areas will be removed immediately and impounded. Finally, the use of any indoor area for wheeled vehicle parking is restricted when, in the best judgment of the person(s) responsible for that area, storage therein interferes with the routine activities normally conducted in that area. When accessing an indoor parking area (i.e. designated indoor parking rooms, personal offices, etc.), vehicle owners should use the most direct path to avoid impedance of indoor pedestrian traffic. Removal and Impoundment of Wheeled Vehicles Any University Police Officer, Transportation officer, or official authorized by the university may remove and impound any wheeled vehicle which: \u2022 Is parked in violation of any of the sections of this policy; \u2022 Appears to have been abandoned as evidenced by signs of disuse or neglect.

Conduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs the class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard to tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the responsibility of the individual instructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if major action, such as dropping the student from the course, is being considered. All classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all holidays and recesses. Both faculty and students are expected to be present. Members of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from classes to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of town, provided the following conditions are met: \u2022 All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; \u2022 No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are not scheduled; \u2022 The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization annually; \u2022 Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student affairs staff member.

Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy Policy Statement No undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure This policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co- curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students. In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. 113\n\nAs with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions.

      "Drop from Academic Program: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the academic program in which they are currently enrolled. Students who have been dropped from an academic program may apply for admission to other academic programs at the university. Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the university. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off of the campus permanently, unless otherwise specified. Students who have been expelled from the university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the university. Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to facilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. Restorative Outcomes These outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional academic disciplinary action. Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The university may require a student to meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is also expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this outcome.

    "question": "Under what conditions will amnesty from university disciplinary action be granted to students seeking medical assistance?",
    "context": [
      "B. Time Frame for Reporting an Incident to the University The university strongly encourages individuals to report possible Prohibited Conduct promptly. Although the university does not limit the time frame for reporting Prohibited Conduct, it may be more difficult for the university to gather relevant and reliable evidence or to take corrective action regarding conduct that is reported to have occurred relatively long ago. If the Respondent is no longer a Student, Staff member, Faculty member, or participant in any university program or activity at the time of the report, or if the conduct does not fall within the scope of the Policy, the university\u2019s ability to take action against the Respondent under the Policy may be limited. The university will, however, also help a Complainant identify other options outside the university, such as local law enforcement, and provide support and resources. C. Information on Amnesty to Students When Reporting Prohibited Conduct to the University The university will not pursue university Prohibited Conduct charges against any Student in an investigation under this Policy for potential violations of university policy for personal consumption of alcohol or other drugs identified during an investigation, as long as any such violations did not and do not place the health or safety of any other person at risk. The university may, however, initiate an assessment, educational discussion, or pursue other developmental interventions (non-disciplinary options) to address the alcohol or other drug use.",
      "The university will provide a legal defense and/or indemnity to any individual who serves as a Social Host of a University Event with Alcohol, pursuant to the Social Host & Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf], and subject to the attached Terms and Conditions for Social Host Defense and Indemnity [pdf]. The rights of faculty and Trustees and Officers of the University who serve as Social Hosts are not governed by the Terms and Conditions for Social Host Defense and Indemnity [pdf]. Rather, faculty defense and indemnity rights continue to be governed by Article VIII of the University By-Laws concerning Professional Protection Regarding Faculty Members. Defense and indemnity rights of Trustees and Officers of the University continue to be governed by Article IX of the University By-Laws concerning Liability and Indemnification of Trustees and Officers. V. Sanctions & Medical Amnesty Faculty, staff, and students who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Visitors to the university who violate this policy may be removed from university property and university events. Individuals who violate this policy may also be referred for criminal prosecution, though criminal charges are not a prerequisite for sanctions under this policy. Information regarding the state and federal criminal penalties for violations of drug and alcohol laws, as well as information regarding the health risks associated with the use of drugs and alcohol, is available in the University\u2019s annual Alcohol and Drug Brochure [pdf]. The university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an environment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another. As specified in the Active Medical Assistance Protocol students will be granted amnesty from university disciplinary action and University Police action when assistance from emergency services personnel is appropriately sought for individuals in need of immediate medical attention due to alcohol or drug use. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, similar amnesty from criminal prosecution is also available to individuals pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.",
      "The individual seeking assistance provided their own name to the emergency services personnel; and 3. The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in need of medical assistance until emergency services personnel arrived and the need for the concerned individual's presence had ended. Those seeking assistance will be assured that the university will likewise not pursue further university action against any individual or organization involved in such an incident when appropriate medical attention is sought. Students who are directly involved in attending to the compromised student until help arrives will also be granted amnesty from university action. Students involved in an incident for which amnesty is granted will be provided appropriate educational or developmental interventions. In cases where help is indicated but not sought, the most severe disciplinary action will be taken against all students involved. This protocol extends the university\u2019s previously established Alcohol Medical Assistance Protocol (1999) and is consistent with the spirit of several Pennsylvania laws that include safe harbor provisions granting immunity from criminal prosecution for seeking medical assistance. Related Pennsylvania Laws: Pennsylvania Alcohol Medical Safe Harbor \u2013 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308.1 (a) Immunity for the individual seeking medical attention for another. \u2014  An individual shall not be prosecuted for an offense under section 6308(a) (relating to purchase,\n\n18 Emergency services personnel include Carnegie Mellon University Police, CMU Student Emergency Medical Services, and other university staff (i.e. Resident Assistants, Community Advisors and Housefellows) who serve in an emergency response capacity. Amnesty may similarly be granted, per the laws cited in this protocol, when non-university law enforcement agencies and/or emergency medical services are contacted though the university will generally have no authority in those determinations. 137",

Restorative Outcomes These outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional community standards action. \u2022 Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The University may require a student to meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this outcome. \u2022 Community Service: The University may require uncompensated service (a specified number of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an outcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre- approved through the appropriate university adjudicator. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed community service. Failure to complete the service satisfactorily within the specified period of time may result in further action through the community standards process. \u2022 Educational/Developmental Assignment: The University may require a student to complete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student\u2019s education and development. These assignments are at the discretion of the university adjudicator or University Disciplinary Committee. Assignments may include but are not limited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an individual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. \u2022 Restitution: In cases where a student is found responsible for damaging or misappropriating physical property, the student may be responsible for reimbursing the property owner for all or some of the cost. In limited circumstances when a complaint was filed prior to the respondent\u2019s degree conferral, the dean of students or designee may consider the following outcomes:\n\n292",
      "The appeal officer will require that the dean of the student\u2019s college review the case and provide input on the final disposition. The appeal officer has the authority to accept, vacate or modify the decision as they deem appropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed. The appeal officer may reconvene the initial Academic Review Board or remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review. Outcomes The academic disciplinary action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions that may be imposed during second-level review. One or more of these actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be imposed as appropriate. Non-compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Review Board process. The determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of the community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Outcomes related to student standing These outcomes clarify the student's standing with the University. Additional violations of the Academic Integrity policy may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the University. \u2022 Disciplinary Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a designated period of time. Probation may entail specific requirements to be met. When a student is on disciplinary probation, they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in the event of further academic disciplinary action. \u2022 Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated period of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves from the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on academic disciplinary suspension is not eligible for student employment by the university during the period of suspension. 130"

Deadly Weapons Policy Objectives This Policy is part of a broad initiative aimed at maintaining the university as a safe place for students, faculty, staff and visitors. The prohibition of deadly weapons on campus is a proactive step toward reducing the risk of injury or death due to the intentional, accidental, inexpert or improper use of firearms. Statement Deadly weapons are not permitted on any property owned or controlled by the university. For the purposes of this policy, a deadly weapon is any device designed to produce death or serious bodily injury. Deadly weapons include, but are not limited to: \u2022 Firearms, whether loaded or unloaded \u2022 Pellet, flare, tranquilizer, stun, spear and dart guns \u2022 Knives with blades larger than that of a folding pocket knife. \u2022 Switchblades \u2022 Daggers \u2022 Striking instruments, including clubs, truncheons, blackjacks, metal knuckles and sap gloves \u2022 Martial arts weapons, including nunchakus, tonfas, staffs and throwing stars \u2022 Bow and arrow combinations \u2022 Explosive devices, including hand grenades, bombs, black powder, smokeless powder, percussion caps, friction primers and pyrotechnic fuses. 157",
      "OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City\u2019s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) launched a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system came a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process allowed event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants had to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants could secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they had a secure venue and dates. Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the 'Getting Started: Event Permits' document under the 'Important Documents' tab on the left for information on the entire permitting process!

No event shall infringe upon the rights or privileges of anyone not in sympathy with it, and no one will be permitted to harm others, damage or deface property, block access to university buildings or disrupt classes. The enforcement of these conditions will not depend in any way on the message or sponsorship of the act or event. When guests are invited by a recognized campus organization, they may express their ideas not because they have a right to do so, but because members of the campus community have a right to hear, see, and experience diverse intellectual and creative inquiry. Defending that right is a fundamental obligation of the university. Controversy cannot be permitted to abridge the freedoms of speech, thought, expression or assembly. They are not matters of convenience, but of necessity. Responsibilities Freedom of expression must be at once fiercely guarded and genuinely embraced. Those who exercise it serve the Carnegie Mellon community by accepting the responsibilities attendant to free expression. University organizations that sponsor invited guests to campus are expected to uphold Carnegie Mellon's educational mission by planning carefully to create safe and thoughtful experiences for those involved. Hosts are responsible for the behavior of their guests and should exercise due care to ensure that all participants abide by relevant university policies. Considerations for Planning Campus Events Consistent with the rights and responsibilities outlined in the university's policy on Freedom of Expression, university hosts must follow all applicable policies related to space reservation, use, safety and security, keeping in mind the responsibility to have campus police present for any event with 100 or more persons in attendance. Hosts should consider the items below as guidance in planning campus events, recognizing that not all of the items below will apply to all events: 1. A public declaration of the event, its purpose, the identification of sponsors and co- sponsors, and contact information for those seeking further information. 2. A plan for advertising the event, including advance notice to relevant members of the community who may wish to co-sponsor, protest, or host other events in response to the planned activity. 3. Where appropriate, a clear and detailed contract with outside speakers, artists, or suppliers of services to ensure continuity of purpose and the ability of the host to reasonably control the event, consistent with the host's intent. 169",

Safety Hazards The occupation, alteration, or use of university facilities that creates a fire or safety hazard (potential or actual), creates danger to individuals or others, or creates a threat to university property is a violation of university regulations and the individual responsible is subject to appropriate disciplinary action. No use of explosive or incendiary materials on university property in connection with programs or activities may take place without the explicit permission of the dean of students and the director of environmental health and safety or their designated representatives.

    "question": "What will be recorded on a student's academic record for work below D?",
    "context": [
      "54\n\ncircumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly advantaged. Mid-Semester Grades Mid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their performance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate are used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in academic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect student performance and are turned in on time. Mid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. Because mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a rule will not be accepted. Incomplete Grades Carnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I (incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has been unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students. In awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the work and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students must complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic semester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the permanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or Enrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade. Pass/Fail Grades Undergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass/fail unless precluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home department/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must submit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they are electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is irreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on to the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be converted to pass/fail. 55",
      "A through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the student's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N on the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N units will not be factored into the student's QPA. In exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or request that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must approve designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will have an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must review the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be made before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. Audit Grades Auditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a letter grade. The extent of a student\u2019s participation must be arranged and approved by the course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the course, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course instructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a course. Any student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. Part-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at the regular per-unit tuition rate. Drop/Withdrawal Grades Students at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or before the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all courses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop\n\n56",
      "131\n\ncompletion is monitored by the process advisor. Assignments may include but are not limited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an individual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. Withholding a Degree Because a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic requirements but also compliance with the university\u2019s standards and good standing as a member of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the resolution of academic disciplinary action proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. Academic Disciplinary Actions Retention and Reporting Records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are confidential and are not released without the consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are retained for three years after final separation of the student from the university. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three continuous years. If a student reenrolls in any student program within three years, the calculation of the final separation date will reset. Consistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of academic disciplinary actions record checks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) provided the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. The file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student separates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a pending Academic Integrity violation. Records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a student from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. Case-specific questions regarding timeframes for academic disciplinary actions records retention and reporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity. 132\n\nCommunity Policies\n\n133\n\nCommunity Policies Activities ...........................................................................................................................................",
      "13. In cases that involve appeals of course-level action, no information about the student's prior violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity will be shared with the Academic Review Board. If the student has prior violations on record and the course-level action is upheld on appeal, the student may be recalled before the board to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the Academic Review Board making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case. 127\n\nHearing Outcome Determination and Notifications 1. A representative of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity will be responsible for notifying the vice provost for education or designee in writing of the recommendation of the hearing group. 2. The vice provost for education or designee makes the decision in the case, informed by the recommendation of the Academic Review Board. The vice provost for education or designee may accept, reject or modify the recommendation, or may remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review. 3. After reviewing the recommendations and rendering a decision, the vice provost for education or designee will notify the student in writing of their decision. 4. The Office of Community Standards and Integrity will send a copy of the final decision letter to the following individuals: \u2022 Course instructor(s) \u2022 Head of the student's home department \u2022 Associate dean of the student's home college \u2022 Academic advisor for the student \u2022 Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student's department) \u2022 Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student's college) 5. Parents of a student will not be notified of any academic disciplinary action, except as permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 6. Academic disciplinary actions will be recorded in the student's disciplinary record in the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in accordance with student conduct records retention practices. When academic disciplinary actions affect eligibility for enrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Academic disciplinary records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the academic record of a student. 128",
      "Policy Provisions Assigning Grades Final grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the semester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie Mellon must be assigned grades. Enrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies of the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the department head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade within one month of Enrollment Service\u2019s query, the department head will be responsible for insuring that a grade is assigned. Changing a Grade A student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade be changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean\u2019s office of the college/school offering the course; for graduate students, department approval is required.

Should a student be non-responsive to notification of an alleged violation of the university's community standards, after a reasonable period of time and having made reasonable attempts to contact the Respondent, the university adjudicator may make a determination regarding responsibility and assign restorative outcomes and/or a period of disciplinary probation based on the information available. Consistent with Administrative Resolution procedures, this determination will be forwarded to the Resolution Review Board for approval. Violations that may result in disciplinary suspension and where the student is non- responsive will be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee for resolution. University Disciplinary Committee The University Disciplinary Committee has jurisdiction in the following cases: 1.

In exercising their own freedoms, they must respect the rights of others. In seeking innovation, they must recognize that constructive change can be affected at a university only through orderly and rational processes. Intentional acts threatening personal safety, malicious destruction of property or willful and substantial disruption of university functions have no place in an academic community and will not be tolerated. It is the responsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an atmosphere in which such violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes which assure the protection of these rights for all persons. Board of Trustees The trustees bear ultimate responsibility for the university, its policies, organization, financing and governance. Two direct responsibilities are the supervision of the university's finances and the appointment of the president as chief executive officer. The operating responsibilities and the authority to act are delegated to the president; and it is primarily through the president that the trustees monitor the university's activities. Administration The administrative officers are formally responsible for supervising the programs and enforcing the policies of the university, for assessing the effects of policy and for recommending improvements or changes where appropriate. The president is the chief executive officer of the university. In the operation of the university, the president delegates responsibility to provost, vice presidents, deans, directors and department heads and to various councils and committees, which may include faculty, students and staff. It is the duty of the administrative officers of the university to maintain a campus climate which enhances the freedom of the faculty to teach, to engage in research and to take part in other scholarly and artistic activities, and the freedom of the students to learn and grow both inside and outside of the classroom. Faculty The faculty has the primary responsibility for carrying out the educational and scholarly programs of the university.

The institute merged with the Mellon Institute (established in 1913 in Pittsburgh by financier Andrew W. Mellon) in 1967.

      "9\n\nEducational Goals Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Academic and Individual Freedom Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 10"

    "question": "What must a student submit to elect a course as pass/fail?",
    "context": [
      "54\n\ncircumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly advantaged. Mid-Semester Grades Mid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their performance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate are used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in academic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect student performance and are turned in on time. Mid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. Because mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a rule will not be accepted. Incomplete Grades Carnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I (incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has been unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students. In awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the work and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students must complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic semester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the permanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or Enrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade. Pass/Fail Grades Undergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass/fail unless precluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home department/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must submit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they are electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is irreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on to the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be converted to pass/fail. 55",
      "These obligations include, but are not limited to, tuition, fees, room and board, student health insurance, library or parking fines, or any other charges due to the university. Grading Policies Policy Statement This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses, whether those students are undergraduates, non-degree students or graduate students. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning and Changing Grades (including Final and Mid-Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options (Audit and Pass/Fail), Drop/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate and graduate Grading Standards. 53\n\nQuestions about grading for a specific course should be addressed to the instructor of the course in question. Graduate students with questions about Pass/Fail and Drop/Withdrawal should contact their individual programs. Appeals for an exception to any grading policy may be made by the dean's office of the student\u2019s home college. 1.",
      "Policy Provisions Assigning Grades Final grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the semester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie Mellon must be assigned grades. Enrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies of the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the department head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade within one month of Enrollment Service\u2019s query, the department head will be responsible for insuring that a grade is assigned. Changing a Grade A student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade be changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean\u2019s office of the college/school offering the course; for graduate students, department approval is required.

      "A through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the student's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N on the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N units will not be factored into the student's QPA. In exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or request that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must approve designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will have an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must review the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be made before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. Audit Grades Auditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a letter grade. The extent of a student\u2019s participation must be arranged and approved by the course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the course, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course instructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a course. Any student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. Part-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at the regular per-unit tuition rate. Drop/Withdrawal Grades Students at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or before the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all courses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop\n\n56",

If the student\u2019s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, the student\u2019s department head or designee should document that decision in writing via email to the student. The Academic Review Board will review the departmental recommendation (if advanced) in a hearing in which the involved student will be given the opportunity to participate. The student\u2019s department head or designee and course instructors will also be given the opportunity to participate in the full review. If they opt not to attend the full hearing, they should be available to participate in the hearing as witnesses. The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether additional university action beyond the course-level outcomes is warranted given multiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. In order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the student\u2019s department head or designee and course instructors will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level actions and supporting evidence related to the violations, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to board member review. Requests for Additional Outcomes Second-level review is required in all cases in which a course instructor or a student\u2019s home department requests additional action beyond course failure. In these circumstances, the course instructor/student\u2019s department head or designee should notify the student in writing via email that additional outcomes are being requested given the severity of the policy violation. This notification may occur in the initial course-level action notification or in a subsequent communication. The Academic Review Board will adjudicate the request for additional outcomes in a hearing in which both the party who is requesting the action and the involved student will be given the opportunity to participate. The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether additional university action beyond course failure is warranted given the nature of the policy violation. In order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the course instructor will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level action and supporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. 123"

      "32\n\nreprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary probation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. Offenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very informal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal procedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human Resources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the Faculty Review Committee for faculty. Restrictions of Privileges During Investigations During the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may be necessary to temporarily suspend a user\u2019s network or computing privileges, but only after determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a risk to the university or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these cases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will be rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the misuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was \u201cattacked\u201d by a Carnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an attack. Adverse Impact on Shared Systems The university reserves the right to discontinue communication with external systems that are known to harbor spammers, account crackers, or phishing sites, despite the fact that this may restrict certain acceptable communications. When deemed necessary, this action will be taken to protect the security and safety of our systems. Similarly, there may be cases where a particular service or activity on a given university system will, by the very nature of its legitimate operation, tend to generate attacks from other Internet sites. If these attacks are frequent and severe enough to cause service interruptions for larger parts of the campus community, it may be necessary to temporarily or permanently remove these systems from the campus network. In cases where such an action is deemed necessary, network administrators will work with the maintainers of the system to identify alternative methods of network access.

      "9\n\nEducational Goals Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Academic and Individual Freedom Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 10",

The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.\u201d (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.) Definitions A Carnegie Mellon course is one conducted under Carnegie Mellon University regulations regarding course content and grading and taught by faculty under the supervision of a Carnegie Mellon academic unit. Courses taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty at a Carnegie Mellon campus and/or teaching location qualify. Courses that are part of the regular offerings of other universities do not qualify, unless faculty at the other universities receive appointments at Carnegie Mellon and handle Carnegie Mellon students under Carnegie Mellon academic regulations. Courses offered for cross-registration are those taken under the PCHE (Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education) agreement or under the Qatar Education City agreement. Only official and final college or university transcripts will be accepted for the awarding of transfer credit."

    "question": "Who inspired Charlie and LaTasha Batch to give back and share lessons during Black History Month?",
    "context": [
      "URL: https://www.steelers.com/news/boykin-wants-to-carry-on-the-tradition\n\nCONTENT:\n\nBoykin wants to carry on the tradition\n\nSteelers.com\n\nIn celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today, receiver Miles Boykin shares why Black History Month is important to him and how hearing from those who came before him has inspired and touched him. There are lessons we all learn in life that come from so many sources, but for receiver Miles Boykin, when it comes to Black History Month, there is no greater source than his grandmother, Cornelia Brigmon. \"Black culture is such a part of American culture,\" said Boykin. \"I think we need to relay that to everybody and recognize its importance in the United States today. \"For me, listening to my grandma is one of the best ways to do it. My grandma would always tell me stories. She is turning close to 80-years old now, so she has some crazy stories. She was born during segregation. I can't even remember the whole specifics, but it was her mom or her grandmother who was born a slave and then they were eventually able to leave out of it. Just some of the stories that she tells me really makes me grateful for what I have today and grateful for those who came before me.\"\n\nThe stories, many of which Boykin likes to just keep close to the vest, have been eye-opening for him and given him an even greater appreciation for those who came before him. \"You hear some of the things and it's almost unfathomable, but it seemed so normal to her,\" said Boykin. \"And now, she's just so grateful for everything. I truly think the older people are, the more appreciation they have for a lot of the things they had to go through. That's all we want for anybody. Hopefully when I'm 80-years old, I'll be able to say the same thing to my kids, and my grandkids, that they have been blessed in the world that they live and try to make it better for everybody. \"To me it means everything to hear stories from her because obviously oral history is so much better. The first-hand encounters are better than learning something from a book or watching it on television. Just the little things that my grandma would teach me about how things were when she was growing up. And even when my mom was growing up, how different things kind of were then as opposed to where we are today. \"It's huge to hear the stories because you don't want to forget where we came from.\"\n\nHearing the stories, understanding the struggles his grandmother went through, makes Boykin realize how far the country has come.

She is on the Advisory Council for Robert Morris Sports Management, Advisory Council for the University of Pittsburgh Brain Institute, a Trustee at Carlow, a member of Leadership Pittsburgh, Family Advisor for the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University, Executive Committee for Off The Field Players Wives Association, and Ladies Council Liaison for the NFLPA.

The Best of the Batch Foundation was founded in 1999, fulfilling a promise Charlie Batch made after his younger sister, Danyl Settles, was shot and killed in 1996, in the crossfire between rival gangs in their Homestead neighborhood. Through the Best of the Batch Foundation, they have established themselves as true difference makers, people the community and region can depend on, to be there for the youth in particular to help give them a better future. The foundation has been serving the area now for 25 years and has been built into a force to serve others by the two. The Foundation was originally housed in a 5,300 square foot building in the Homestead area. Earlier this year, they opened a new 'Clubhouse,' a building that was originally planned for 21,000 square feet, but through additional development is now a state-of-the-art educational facility that is 33,000 square feet. The foundation's mission is to provide children in grades K-12 in Western Pennsylvania free programs focused on education, health and wellness, outreach services and more, with the majority of the activities taking place in the 'Clubhouse,' a welcoming, safe place where kids can hang out with their friends and learn at the same time. \"Latasha did a great job steering the course and making sure that everything aligned to where everything needed to be,\" said Charlie Batch when the 'Clubhouse' opened. \"She deserves more credit than I do with this particular project because she stayed on it. She was making sure whatever detail that needed to be handled, she was on it.\"",

      "February is Black History Month, a time to honor those who have made a difference in our country and broke racial barriers. Steelers.com is highlighting stories from those who were touched by individuals who have broken barriers, to sharing the stories of those who broke barriers themselves. Sometimes, timing can be everything. And for Larry Brown, the former Steelers tight end/tackle who is a member of the team's Hall of Honor, that was certainly the case. Brown grew up during a time when segregation was the rule and not the exception in the South. It came with Brown, an African American, not able to enjoy the same things white people in his area did. He couldn't eat at the same restaurants, use the same door to go to the doctor's office, use the same restrooms or go to the same school as the white kids in his hometown of Starke, Florida. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Until things changed in 1964. On July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation in businesses, it banned discriminatory practices in employment and ended segregation in places such as public schools. That ruling changed Brown's life for good. There were two high schools in Brown's hometown, one had a football team, one didn't. In Brown's junior year of high school in 1965, while attending school that didn't offer football, he realized the high school football powerhouse in his area, Bradford High School, was now desegregated. His mind thought about transferring there, but he wasn't quite ready at that time to make the move to the new school. When the spring of 1966 rolled around, Brown joined the team for spring practice. They were coming off the 1965 state championship, and for a young man that had a love for football growing in his heart, it was an opportunity he never could have envisioned. So, he jumped at it. \"During that time, we lived in the deep South, we lived in Florida, in a small town, a rural town and everything was segregated,\" said Brown. \"Everything was that way, restaurants, schools, just the way of life was segregated. Going into the doctor's office, there was what they called a colored entrance. It was a way of life down there. \"Luckily for me in that regard, desegregation happened the year prior to me going to Bradford because I thought about it for a minute. I didn't go over there in my junior year. I waited and went my senior year. \"I was always a fan of football, watching games on television. They won the state championship at Bradford my junior year. I remember following them on the radio. I thought, maybe I would give it a try. \"I played a lot of football for fun, touch football, in gym class and on the street. I thought I would like to try going out for a team. So, I went over that spring before my senior year. They had spring training practice going on. I went over and met the coach. I went with one other student, and we had a chance to do their spring training. I'd walk over to the other place after school and it was",

Steelers.com is highlighting stories from those who were touched by individuals who have broken barriers, to sharing the stories of those who broke barriers themselves. For many, February is a time to celebrate Black History Month, learn more about those who made a difference paving a way for racial equality. For Steelers receiver Calvin Austin III, celebrating those individuals isn't something the calendar dictates, as he has seen that history first-hand, growing up in Memphis, Tennessee, the home of the National Civil Rights Museum. The Museum is the former site of the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. It has been transformed into a tribute to Dr. King and all of the work done by him and many others for the civil rights movement. And it's a location Austin has been to multiple times. From a school trip as a kid, to a visit when Memphis played in the Liberty Bowl, to when he was honored at the Black Men Crowned Awards held at the museum in 2021, Austin has walked through the museum time and time again, learning something new every time and taking in everything that Dr. King did to help with the civil rights movement. \"I've been there a lot and each time you focus on something different, or learn something new, or get moved by something you didn't think about,\" said Austin. \"For anyone who wants to go, I would encourage you to go again, because I feel like you really can't capture everything with just one tour or walk around. \"There is so much there, so much history, and so many lessons learned about Dr. King.\""

But former Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy considered Hawes the best of the bunch in Mobile, Ala. this year when it comes to in-line blocking. Hawes spent his first three collegiate seasons at Yale and showed he's passing-game capable if need be at the Senior Bowl.

      "1. Ashton Jenty, Boise State, 5-8 1/2, 211 lbs. - An elite talent at the college level, Jenty quite literally carried Boise State into the college playoffs. He's an explosive, high-volume runner. Some might be scared away by his heavy workload, but Jenty was injury-free in college. He's tough and physical with breakaway ability. 2. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Teams looking for the next Jamhyr Gibbs might look to Henderson earlier than we might think in this draft. He's a home-run hitter with good hands. While Henderson isn't the biggest back, he's outstanding in pass protection, a key ingredient to early playing time. 3. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton has good speed and runs with an aggressive nature. He runs extremely hard, sometimes to his own detriment. He could slow things down a bit to pick his holes better, but he has enough speed to outrun defenders and barrel over those he doesn't. 4. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State, 5-11 5/8, 221 lbs. - A hard-nosed runner who catches the ball well out of the backfield, Judkins has the power to run inside and the patience to get outside on zone runs. The sub-4.5 40 speed he showed off at the NFL Scouting Combine doesn't hurt, either. 5. Cam Skattebo, Arizona State, 5-9 1/2, 219 lbs. - For a player without home-run speed, Skattebo breaks off a lot of long runs because of his excellent contact balance. He's impossible to get on the ground. But that running style also leads to Skattebo taking a lot of punishment. He's very good in the passing game, as well. Sleeper: Damien Martinez, Miami (Fla.), 5-11 5/8, 217 lbs \u2013 Martinez was the Pac-12 Offensive Rookie of the Year at Oregon State and a 1,000-yard season as a true sophomore before transferring to Miami, where he posted another 1,000-yard season. With his size, he's the bruising runner you'd expect. But he also averaged more than 6 yards per carry in each of his three college seasons, has good contact balance and is a solid pass protector. He looks NFL ready to be the thunder portion of an NFL committee, with the potential to be an every-down back. Matt's Take\n\nThis is a truly exceptional running back class and could be the strongest position group in this entire draft class. This group of running backs has a true superstar at the top of the list, plenty of projectable starters at the next level, great depth all through the entire draft, and a very wide variety of players at this position. The 2025 running back group has someone for everyone, but as the draft goes along, it might also provide excellent value on the third day of the draft. In fact, don't be surprised if several undrafted players at this position go on to have very successful NFL careers. Matt's Rankings",
      "1.Tyler Warren, Penn State, 6-5 \u00bd, 256 lbs. - Big and athletic, Warren caught 104 passes for over 1,200 yards in Penn State's offense last season. He also lined up as a Wildcat quarterback, ran the ball and did everything you might expect a former high school quarterback to do. He was the straw that stirred the drink. He's also a capable blocker. 2. Colston Loveland, Michigan, 6-5 \u00be, 248 lbs. - Loveland had a better season in 2023 during Michigan's national championship run, but that was largely due to Michigan's issues at quarterback in 2024. He's a talented player and good all-around tight end who has been on the NFL radar since his freshman season. He is extremely athletic as a pass catcher and should continue to develop as a blocker as his frame fills out. 3. Mason Taylor, LSU, 6-5 \u215b, 251 lbs. - The son of Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive end and Pittsburgh native Jason Taylor, Mason Taylor is a plus athlete at the position who understands how to get open and uses his big frame to shield off defenders. He'll need to continue to grow as a blocker, but will give a team a valuable receiving chip until that happens.",
      "That being said, there could be some surprises, as we'll see good players at the position taken in Rounds 3 and 4. The wildcard will be Colorado's Travis Hunter. I, however, view him as a cornerback prospect who will play wide receiver as a secondary position. Dale's Rankings\n\n1. Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona, 6-4 1/8, 219 lbs. - A big receiver with good ball skills, McMillan was extremely productive, posting over 80 catches and 1,300 yards in each of the past two seasons, winning as a size mismatch. Will that translate to the NFL against bigger, more physically gifted receivers? We'll see. He has good run-after-the-catch ability but isn't necessarily a blazer. There's definitely a tantalizing skillset here."

    "question": "When is the deadline for clubs to exercise their right of first refusal to restricted free agents who signed offer sheets?",
    "context": [
      "agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a \"right of first refusal\" on any offer sheet the player signs. If the old club does not match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the amount of its qualifying offer. If an offer sheet is not executed on or before April 18, the player's negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club. In addition, prior to the start of free agency a player who would otherwise be a restricted free agent may be designated by his old club as its franchise player or transition player. Q. What are the right of first refusal/qualifying offer amounts for players who have completed three accrued seasons? A. For right of first refusal only, a one-year salary of at least $3,263,000. For right of first refusal and compensation at the player's original draft round, a one-year salary of at least $3,406,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater. For right of first refusal and compensation of one second-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $5,346,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater. For right of first refusal and compensation of one first-round draft selection, a one-year salary of at least $7,458,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater. For right of first refusal and compensation of only one first-round draft selection, but any provision in the new club's offer sheet waiving or limiting the new club's ability to designate the player as a franchise or transition player is not a principal term and need not be matched by the prior club, a one-year salary of at least $7,958,000 or 110 percent of the 2024 Paragraph 5 salary, whichever is greater. Q. What determines an unrestricted free agent? A. A player with four or more accrued seasons whose contract has expired. He is free to sign with any club, with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club, through July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). At that point, his negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club if by April 28 the old club tendered the player a one-year contract for 110 percent of his prior year's salary. His old club then has until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season (November 11) to sign him. If he does not sign by that date, he must sit out the season. If no tender is offered by April 28, the player can be signed by any club at any time throughout the season. Q. What determines a franchise player? A. The salary offer by a player's club determines what type of franchise player he is: exclusive or non-exclusive. An \"exclusive\" franchise player \u2013 not free to sign with another club \u2013 is offered the greater of (i) the average of the top five salaries at the player's position for the current year as of the end of the restricted free agent signing period on April",
      "ET on Monday, March 10 until 3:59:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 12, clubs are permitted to contact and enter into contract negotiations with the certified agents of players who will become unrestricted free agents upon expiration of their 2024 player contracts at 4:00 p.m. ET on March 12. The two-day negotiating period applies only to prospective unrestricted free agents. It does not apply to players who have received, or who may receive, a required tender applicable to the 2025 League Year (e.g., exclusive rights players, restricted free agents, franchise players or transition players). Q. What are the categories of free agency? A. Players are either \"restricted free agents\" or \"unrestricted free agents.\" A restricted free agent may be subject to a \"qualifying offer.\" A restricted or unrestricted free agent may be designated by his prior club as its franchise player or transition player. Q. What is the time period for free agency signings this year? A. For restricted free agents, from March 12 to April 18. For unrestricted free agents who have received a tender from their prior club by the Monday immediately following the final day of the NFL Draft for the 2025 League Year (i.e., April 28), from March 12 to July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). For franchise players, from March 12 until the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 11. For transition players, from March 12 until July 22. After July 22 and until 4 p.m. ET on the Tuesday following Week 10 of the regular season, November 11, the prior club has exclusive negotiating rights to unrestricted free agents and transition players. If the above-listed players do not sign by November 11, they must sit out the season. Q. What is the difference between a restricted free agent and an unrestricted free agent? A. In the 2025 league year, players with three accrued seasons who have received a qualifying offer become restricted free agents when their contracts expire at the conclusion of the 2024 league year on March 12. Unrestricted free agents have completed four or more accrued seasons. Upon expiration of his 2024 contract, an unrestricted free agent is free to sign with any club with no draft-choice compensation owed to his old club. Q. What constitutes an \"accrued season\"? A. Six or more regular season games on a club's active/inactive, reserve/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists. Q. How do the free agency rules apply to restricted free agents? A. If a player with three accrued seasons has received a \"qualifying offer\" (a salary tender predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his old club, he can negotiate with any club through April 19. If the restricted free agent signs an offer sheet with a new club, his old club can match the offer and retain him because the qualifying offer entitles it to a \"right of first refusal\" on any offer sheet the player signs.",
      "June 1 - Deadline for prior club to send \"June 1 Tender\" to its unsigned restricted free agents who received a qualifying offer for a right of first refusal only in order for such player to be subject to the CBA's \"June 15 Tender\" provision. June 15 - Deadline for club to withdraw higher qualifying offer to restricted free agents and still retain exclusive negotiating rights by substituting lower \"June 15 Tender\" of one-year contract at 110 percent of the player's prior-year Paragraph 5 Salary (with all other terms of his prior-year contract carried forward unchanged). Late June - Rookie Readiness Program to be held at individual clubs. July 15 - At 4:00 p.m., New York time, deadline for any club that designated a Franchise Player to sign such player to a multiyear contract or extension. After this date, the player may sign only a one-year contract with his prior club for the 2025 season, and such contract cannot be extended until after the club's last regular season game. Mid-July - Clubs are permitted to open preseason training camp for rookies (defined as a player who has never signed an NFL player contract with a club in a prior league year) beginning seven days prior to the club's mandatory reporting date for veteran players. A club's preseason training camp will be deemed to have officially opened on the designated reporting date for all rookies. Clubs may require first-year players (defined as a player who signed a player contract with any NFL club in a prior league year, but who does not have a pension-credited season) to report on the designated reporting date for all rookies, or at any time thereafter, including, but not limited to, the designated reporting date for veteran quarterbacks and injured players, or the designated reporting date for all other veteran players. Veteran quarterbacks and \"injured players\" (as defined in CBA Article 21, Section 6) may be required to report to the club's preseason training camp no earlier than five days immediately prior to the mandatory reporting date for all other veteran players, provided the club has already opened (or simultaneously opens) its official preseason training camp for all rookies. July 21 - At 4:00 p.m., New York time, signing period ends for Transition Players with outstanding tenders. After this date and until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the Tuesday following the 10th weekend of the regular season, prior club has exclusive negotiating rights. At 4:00 p.m., New York time, on July 21 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp [July 16 in 2025], whichever is later) signing period ends for unrestricted free agents to whom a \"UFA Tender\" was made by prior club. After this date and until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the Tuesday following the 10th weekend of the regular season, prior club has exclusive negotiating rights.

      "Let me start from the beginning, for hopefully the last time. Teams cannot sign any potential free agents from other teams until 4 p.m. on March 12. Teams are able to re-sign their own potential free agents at any time, but those guys will get the right to gauge their value on the open market starting on March 10, which is the legal tampering period. And the most important thing to consider is that IT'S A NEGOTIATION.",

    "question": "Which NFL team did MyCole Pruitt play for before joining the Steelers?",
    "context": [
      "before signing with the Detroit Lions . [ 6 ] [ 13 ] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. [ 14 ] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season , they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" Steagles \". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. [ 15 ] In 1944 , they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). [ 6 ] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. [ 16 ] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947 , tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles . This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field , which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. [ 17 ] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" Playoff Bowl \" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. [ 18 ] In 1970 , the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. [ 19 ] The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. [ 20 ] Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season . [ 21 ] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969 , Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970 , Jack Ham in 1971 , Franco Harris in 1972 , [ 22 ] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann , Jack Lambert , John Stallworth , Donnie Shell and Mike Webster . [ 23 ] The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted five future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year. [ 24 ] The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two. [ 25 ] They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins ( 1971 \u2013 1979 ) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year. The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137",
      "\"The timing was right for me. It was quite a blessing.\"\n\nThanks to his time at Bradford High School, Brown was able to earn a scholarship to the University of Kansas. And ultimately the Steelers drafted him in the fifth round of the 1971 NFL Draft, landing him at a place that was an ideal situation. \"When I got here, you could just tell the makeup of the club, the way people were treated, the community aspect of the team itself and the coaching,\" said Brown. \"It was the perfect place for me. I got a chance to play on what arguably was one of the best teams that was ever assembled with all the players. There were a lot of players who didn't necessarily get some of the hype, but also very good players throughout the roster. The Rooneys and Coach (Chuck) Noll had a philosophy that was focused on the best players available. You felt like you were getting a fair shot. That's the way it was the whole time.",

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\n\nAfter playing for the Vikings, Bears and Texans, while also spending some time with the 49ers, Pruitt joined the Titans when Smith was the tight ends coach in 2018. In 2022, he left Tennessee as a free agent and was signed by the Falcons, where Smith had moved as head coach. In 109 career games, 39 of them starts, Pruitt has 71 receptions for 748 yards and 12 touchdowns. In his past two seasons with the Falcons, Pruitt caught 25 passes for 260 yards and five touchdowns. Pruitt has been considered an above-average run blocker at the tight end position in his career. Dale Lolley is co-host of \"SNR Drive\" on Steelers Nation Radio.

      "He'll join a crowded tight end room with the Steelers that already includes starter Pat Freiermuth, second-year pro Darnell Washington, a third-round pick in 2023, third-year pro Connor Heyward and Rodney Williams on the Steelers' roster. All four were on the Steelers' roster for the majority of last season, with Williams holding down a spot as a special teams player. Smith has liked to use multiple-tight end sets as a coordinator, meaning the Steelers could keep four tight ends again in 2024. Pruitt played 122 special teams snaps in 2023 for Atlanta, but Heyward and Williams were at 247 and 189, respectively, with Williams getting to that total despite being on the practice squad for the first four games of the season. Pruitt would be competition for that third or fourth tight end spot, or could serve as insurance in case of an injury at the position prior to the start of the season. He also gives the Steelers another player, along with recently signed wide receiver Van Jefferson and running back/return man Cordarrelle Patterson, who played for Smith in Atlanta last season. That could be critical in terms of providing veteran leadership as the team installs a new offense under Smith.

      "Arthur Smith, previous head coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three years (2021-23),  is in his \ufb01rst season as the Steelers' o\ufb00ensive coordinator in 2024. This marks his 16th year in the National Football League coaching ranks. Under Smith's guidance, the Falcons led the NFL in fewest penalties (2022), ranked third in successful play rate on rushing attempts, based on EPA, (2022), \ufb01nished third in rushing yards/game (2022), ninth in rushing yards/game (2023), 10th in third-down conversion rate (2022), 13th in third-down conversion rate (2023) and 13th in passing yards/attempt (2023). Atlanta eclipsed 400 total yards of o\ufb00ense on six occasions in 2023, tied for the fourth-most in single-season franchise history. The Falcons and Miami were the only teams in the NFL to \ufb01nish the season with a top-10 rushing attack and a top-\ufb01ve opponent pressure rate. Bijan Robinson \ufb01nished the season second among rookies with 1,463 yards from scrimmage. He recorded the most yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (1,463) and led all NFL rookies with 976 rushing yards, while adding 487 receiving yards and eight TDs (four rushing, four receiving). Robinson set the franchise record for most receptions by a rookie running back (58) and became the \ufb01fth rookie running back in League history to record at least 1,400 yards from scrimmage, 55 receptions and four receiving TDs. He also registered the most games with 100 yards from scrimmage by a rookie in franchise history (six). Kyle Pitts (667) and Jonnu Smith (582) are the \ufb01rst pair of tight ends to both have 500+ receiving yards in the same season since Zach Ertz (916) and Dallas Goedert (607) in 2019 with Philadelphia. Atlanta's rushing attack averaged 74.5 more rushing yards per game in 2022 than it did in 2021, resulting in the largest one-season improvement by any team since at least 2001. Additionally, Tyler Allgeier became the sixth rookie in the NFL, selected in the \ufb01fth round-or-later, to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards over the past 20 seasons. First-round selection Drake London \ufb01nished his rookie season in 2022 with 72 receptions for 866 yards and four TDs, surpassing Pitts (68 in 2021) for the most receptions by a rookie in franchise history. With Allgeier (1,035 rushing) and London (866 receiving), the Falcons became the fourth team to have a 1,000-yard rookie rusher and an 800-yard rookie receiver in the same season in NFL history. In his \ufb01rst year at the helm, running back Cordarrelle Patterson set single-season then career highs for rushing yards (618), receiving yards (548), rushing TDs (six) and receiving TDs (\ufb01ve), and became the \ufb01rst player to record at least \ufb01ve rushing and \ufb01ve receiving TDs in a single season in franchise history. Additionally, Pitts became the second rookie tight end to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in NFL history, joining Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Ditka (1,076 yards in 1961). Pitts broke the single-season franchise record for most receiving yards by a tight end",

That isn't \"Golden fast\" but it's fast enough for Burden to excel as a run-after-the-catch wide receiver and as one who is capable of taking the top off of a defense.

Williams caught  60 passes for 611 yards and six touchdowns in 2024. He also carried 51 times for 322 yards and six more scores. His NFL comparison in the eyes of some is Cordarrelle Patterson.

He always responded, and I actually felt like he went out of his way a lot of times.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the people of this city \u2013 they revered Mike Lange. He understood them, and they understood him. He once said it\u2019s not the Cups or individual magic on the ice that would stick with him forever. \u201cI think, God, was I lucky to get to know some of these great people.

The goaltender had just returned to Pittsburgh after getting called up from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League, where rookie Joel Blomqvist was re-assigned following a loss to Toronto on Sunday. Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said they felt that was the best course of action for Blomqvist\u2019s growth and development at this point in time, which means Jarry is back in the mix with Pittsburgh for the foreseeable future. He spoke after Thursday\u2019s practice in Vegas for the first time since rejoining the group. \u201cI want to be here. This is where I signed, and this is where I intend to be,\u201d said Jarry, a 2013 second-round pick who inked a five-year contract extension in the summer of 2023. \u201cI was drafted here, and I came up through the minors and worked my way up to Pittsburgh, and that was my goal \u2013 to be a Penguin the whole time. It\u2019s something where I had a little bump in the road, and going down to Wilkes, I think will help my game.\u201d\n\nThis is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Jarry, a two-time NHL All-Star, had first reported to WBS for a two-week conditioning stint in November following a difficult start to the season. As detailed here , the Penguins hoped it would serve as a reset, and Jarry did do well \u2013 winning four of five games against good competition. After the 14 days were up, Penguins President of Hockey Operations Kyle Dubas said they committed to giving Jarry \u201csome good runway\u201d in Pittsburgh. But for whatever reason, the inconsistency continued. So, Jarry went back to WBS in January, this time with no timeline. As Dubas said then, \u201cThe job is now to go and earn his way back up. It's solely circumstantial with this.\u201d",

Harding, 20, has spent the 2024-25 season as an alternate captain for the Brampton Steelheads of the Ontario Hockey League. Through 59 games, the 6-foot-2, 192-pound defenseman has posted seven goals, 48 assists and a career-high 55 points.

So, in that spot, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really expecting to get finished there. If anything, maybe rubbed out. I think his teammate had the puck the whole time through the neutral zone and dumped it in. I chased it from the other corner.

And just take each day as it comes.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins did a tremendous job of that on Tuesday in Colorado, their last game before the deadline hits at Friday at 3 PM Eastern time, where they played much better than the final score indicated. It was a one-goal game for most of the night before the Avalanche converted a late power play and tacked on a couple of empty-netters for a 4-1 win. Rickard Rakell tallied for Pittsburgh, while Alex Nedeljkovic made 21 saves. \u201cI loved our team game,\u201d Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. \u201cI thought the guys played hard tonight. There was structure. There was collective effort in all three zones. I thought it was a good hockey game for 56 minutes. Got an unfortunate penalty late in the game.

    "question": "Why is Black History Month important to Miles Boykin?",
    "context": [
      "URL: https://www.steelers.com/news/boykin-wants-to-carry-on-the-tradition\n\nCONTENT:\n\nBoykin wants to carry on the tradition\n\nSteelers.com\n\nIn celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today, receiver Miles Boykin shares why Black History Month is important to him and how hearing from those who came before him has inspired and touched him. There are lessons we all learn in life that come from so many sources, but for receiver Miles Boykin, when it comes to Black History Month, there is no greater source than his grandmother, Cornelia Brigmon. \"Black culture is such a part of American culture,\" said Boykin. \"I think we need to relay that to everybody and recognize its importance in the United States today. \"For me, listening to my grandma is one of the best ways to do it. My grandma would always tell me stories. She is turning close to 80-years old now, so she has some crazy stories. She was born during segregation. I can't even remember the whole specifics, but it was her mom or her grandmother who was born a slave and then they were eventually able to leave out of it. Just some of the stories that she tells me really makes me grateful for what I have today and grateful for those who came before me.\"\n\nThe stories, many of which Boykin likes to just keep close to the vest, have been eye-opening for him and given him an even greater appreciation for those who came before him. \"You hear some of the things and it's almost unfathomable, but it seemed so normal to her,\" said Boykin. \"And now, she's just so grateful for everything. I truly think the older people are, the more appreciation they have for a lot of the things they had to go through. That's all we want for anybody. Hopefully when I'm 80-years old, I'll be able to say the same thing to my kids, and my grandkids, that they have been blessed in the world that they live and try to make it better for everybody. \"To me it means everything to hear stories from her because obviously oral history is so much better. The first-hand encounters are better than learning something from a book or watching it on television. Just the little things that my grandma would teach me about how things were when she was growing up. And even when my mom was growing up, how different things kind of were then as opposed to where we are today. \"It's huge to hear the stories because you don't want to forget where we came from.\"\n\nHearing the stories, understanding the struggles his grandmother went through, makes Boykin realize how far the country has come. But he is also aware of how much further we still need to go. \"I think we're always going to be working towards being perfect, because there's no such thing as perfect,\" said Boykin. \"Just seeing how far the needle has moved since then is definitely amazing.\"",
      "Education. That is a word so many Steelers players point to when talking about Black history, wanting to educate themselves continually and wanting others to do the same. \"In elementary school, and the school system in general, I don't feel like we learned too much about Black history,\" said linebacker Malik Reed. \"It seemed like it was a small amount. I think it's important for kids nowadays to learn Black history and get the accounts and stories of things that have been accomplished over the years. See where we have come from and where we are now. \"I stand firm in my faith I think God is a huge reason why we are where we are today. Me and my wife like to read up on different stories whether it's Black people that invented something back in the day. I like to dive in to educate each other and continue to grow in that area.\"\n\nSafety Miles Killebrew knows the more you educate yourself, the more you can recognize those who have made a difference, which includes people in the history of the country, as well as people who are making a difference today. \"My father is Black, I am of mixed decent, Black and White,\" said safety Miles Killebrew. \"Anytime there is an opportunity to recognize someone in this country for their unique background or their diversity or whatever it is, I think it's important to recognize that because that is what makes this country so special. \"It's a great reminder to spread love in our community. I would say that this is a time when the Nation needs a lot more love and I want to be at the forefront of that with the guys around me.\"\n\nWhile Black History Month is celebrated in February, for these players and countless others that history is something that is celebrated year-round. \"It's important because it celebrates equality and it's fighting for equal rights for all people,\" said linebacker Alex Highsmith. \"You recognize that every single day and celebrate that. I think it's important for me just being part African American, just recognizing that and continuing to celebrate what we have been given as equal rights.\"\n\nRelated News:\n\nBoykin wants to carry on the tradition * Harvin making his mark * Mitchell broke barriers to live out his dream * Perry broke barriers across the board\n\nRelated Content\n\nDoing their part during Black History Month\n\nGiving back and sharing lessons is a key part of Black History Month for Charlie and LaTasha Batch\n\nTiming was everything for Brown\n\nLarry Brown lived through segregation but came out even stronger\n\nNunn's impact still being felt\n\nBill Nunn made a lasting impact on the Steelers and the NFL\n\nAustin inspired by lessons he has embraced\n\nCalvin Austin III knows it's important to always embrace and teach Black History\n\nBreaking barriers across the board\n\nLowell Perry broke barriers in the NFL and beyond\n\nMitchell broke barriers to live out his dream\n\nAssistant head coach John Mitchell was a pioneer at the University of Alabama\n\nBoykin wants to carry on the tradition",
      "February is Black History Month, a time to honor those who have made a difference in our country and broke racial barriers. Steelers.com is highlighting stories from those who were touched by individuals who have broken barriers, to sharing the stories of those who broke barriers themselves. Sometimes, timing can be everything. And for Larry Brown, the former Steelers tight end/tackle who is a member of the team's Hall of Honor, that was certainly the case. Brown grew up during a time when segregation was the rule and not the exception in the South. It came with Brown, an African American, not able to enjoy the same things white people in his area did. He couldn't eat at the same restaurants, use the same door to go to the doctor's office, use the same restrooms or go to the same school as the white kids in his hometown of Starke, Florida. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Until things changed in 1964. On July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation in businesses, it banned discriminatory practices in employment and ended segregation in places such as public schools. That ruling changed Brown's life for good. There were two high schools in Brown's hometown, one had a football team, one didn't. In Brown's junior year of high school in 1965, while attending school that didn't offer football, he realized the high school football powerhouse in his area, Bradford High School, was now desegregated. His mind thought about transferring there, but he wasn't quite ready at that time to make the move to the new school. When the spring of 1966 rolled around, Brown joined the team for spring practice. They were coming off the 1965 state championship, and for a young man that had a love for football growing in his heart, it was an opportunity he never could have envisioned. So, he jumped at it. \"During that time, we lived in the deep South, we lived in Florida, in a small town, a rural town and everything was segregated,\" said Brown. \"Everything was that way, restaurants, schools, just the way of life was segregated. Going into the doctor's office, there was what they called a colored entrance. It was a way of life down there. \"Luckily for me in that regard, desegregation happened the year prior to me going to Bradford because I thought about it for a minute. I didn't go over there in my junior year. I waited and went my senior year. \"I was always a fan of football, watching games on television. They won the state championship at Bradford my junior year. I remember following them on the radio. I thought, maybe I would give it a try. \"I played a lot of football for fun, touch football, in gym class and on the street. I thought I would like to try going out for a team. So, I went over that spring before my senior year. They had spring training practice going on. I went over and met the coach. I went with one other student, and we had a chance to do their spring training. I'd walk over to the other place after school and it was",
      "Boykin knows he wouldn't be where he is today without the struggles those in his family endured, and that is what gives him the strength in everything he does. \"The same blood that runs in her veins, runs in mine,\" said Boykin. \"She was so tough to be able to make it through all the stuff she did. I'm just as tough now because of her. I am proud of where my family has come from, where my family has been and where it is today. And I'm just trying to carry on that tradition.\"\n\nCarrying that on means sharing his message with others, sharing his story, sharing inspiration with those who are coming after him and sharing advice for young kids today. \"I would say be proud of being Black first and foremost,\" said Boykin. \"And then try to find ways to learn about your history.",

Steelers.com is highlighting stories from those who were touched by individuals who have broken barriers, to sharing the stories of those who broke barriers themselves. For many, February is a time to celebrate Black History Month, learn more about those who made a difference paving a way for racial equality. For Steelers receiver Calvin Austin III, celebrating those individuals isn't something the calendar dictates, as he has seen that history first-hand, growing up in Memphis, Tennessee, the home of the National Civil Rights Museum. The Museum is the former site of the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. It has been transformed into a tribute to Dr. King and all of the work done by him and many others for the civil rights movement. And it's a location Austin has been to multiple times. From a school trip as a kid, to a visit when Memphis played in the Liberty Bowl, to when he was honored at the Black Men Crowned Awards held at the museum in 2021, Austin has walked through the museum time and time again, learning something new every time and taking in everything that Dr. King did to help with the civil rights movement. \"I've been there a lot and each time you focus on something different, or learn something new, or get moved by something you didn't think about,\" said Austin. \"For anyone who wants to go, I would encourage you to go again, because I feel like you really can't capture everything with just one tour or walk around. \"There is so much there, so much history, and so many lessons learned about Dr. King.\""

    "context": [
      "broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk , both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst, [ 125 ] while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers . [ 126 ] Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps , Kevin Young , and Neil Walker . Past Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter , usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955. [ 127 ] Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] Nicknamed \"The Gunner,\" Prince was known for his \"Gunnerisms\"\u2014nicknames and quips\u2014and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC . Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince. [ 130 ] Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett , who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015. [ 131 ] Former analysts include Don Hoak , Nelson Briles , and Jim Rooker . Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass , who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.

      "sports, but it was the Buenos Aires Football Club, founded June 20, 1867, that kindled Argentine passions. In almost every instance, the first to adopt football were the cosmopolitan sons of local elites, many of whom had been sent to British schools by their Anglophile parents. Seeking status as well as diversion, middle-class employees of British firms followed the upper-class lead. From the gamut of games played by the upper and middle classes, the industrial workers of Europe and Latin America, like the indigenous population of Africa, appropriated football as their own. By the late 19th century, the United States had begun to rival Great Britain as an industrial power and as an inventor of modern sports. Enthusiasts of baseball denied its origins in British children\u2019s games such as cat and rounders and concocted the myth of Abner Doubleday, who allegedly invented the game in 1839 in Cooperstown, New York. A more plausible date for the transformation of cat and rounders into baseball is 1845, when a New York bank clerk named Alexander Cartwright formulated the rules of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club. Even before the Civil War, the game had been taken over by urban workers such as the volunteer firemen who organized the New York Mutuals in 1857. By the time the National League was created in 1876, the game had spread from coast to coast. (It was not until the 1950s, however, that Major League Baseball planted its first franchises on the West Coast.)"

Johnston, who is entering his seventh season in the NFL, spent the last three years with the Houston Texans. He entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 NFL Draft, spending three seasons there. Johnston has played in 95 games, punting 445 times for 21,029 yards, a gross 47.3-yard average, with a net average of 42.4 yards. He has downed 182 punts inside the 20-yard line. He has hit a punt of at least 60 yards in each of his first six seasons. Johnston appeared in 13 games in 2023, punting 66 times for 3,145 yards, a gross 47.7-yard average. He downed 30 punts inside the 20-yard line, an impressive 45 percent. He nailed a 74-yard punt in Week 8 against the Carolina Panthers, punting from his own end zone for a career-long, and the longest in Texans history. He punted in both of the Texans postseason games last season, averaging 46 yards in the AFC Wild Card win over the Browns, and 43.4 yards in Divisional Round loss to the Ravens. In 2022 he led the AFC and tied for second in the NFL with 37 punts inside the 20-yard line, tying a career-high he set in 2021. He ranked first in the AFC with 42.05 percent of his punts landing inside the 20-yard line, and fourth best in the NFL. It was also the fourth highest single season mark in Texans' history. His 42.6-yard net average ranked second in the AFC, while his 48.1-yard gross average ranked third in the AFC. While with the Eagles he finished fourth in the NFL in punting yards (3,318) and net punting yards (2,2924) in 2020, as well as tying for sixth in the NFL in punts inside the 20-yard line (26). Johnston set single season Eagles' records in gross punting average (48.1) and net punting average (42.7) in 2018. Johnston played four seasons at Ohio State where he was named Big Ten Eddleman-Fields Punter of the Year and was a second-team All-America selection his senior year. He also attended St. Joseph's College in Newtown, Australia and took part in the Melbourne-based punter/kicker training ground Prokick Australia and was a former Australian Rules football player for Melbourne Football Club.

In 2023, he averaged 4.25 seconds of hang time on his punts, which ranked 28th in the NFL, but his net average of 44.0 yards last season was fourth-highest in the NFL. Johnston also placed 30 of his 66 punts a year ago inside the opposing 20, which tied for seventh-most in the NFL. Former Steelers punter Pressley Harvin, who was released at the end of the 2023 season, also placed 30 punts inside the opposing 20, but did so on 78 attempts.

His father died when he was just 16-years old, the summer before his senior year of high school. Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, who played at the University of Pittsburgh and in the NFL, had to give up football in 1999 because of a tumor that impacted his vision in the right eye. They thought that was the end of things, but it wasn't. He suffered a stroke, becoming paralyzed on the right side. \"He was working to walk for my senior night,\" Heyward shared. \"Before that happened, the summer before my senior year, he ended up passing away while I was at a basketball camp. My mom had to be the one to tell me. I remember that day clearly, looking for my mom, not knowing what was happening. I could feel everybody was being very delicate with me.

In the past two years, the Steelers have selected offensive linemen Broderick Jones, Spencer Anderson, Troy Fautanu, Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick in the draft. All are 24 or younger, with Jones and Frazier being the youngest at 23. With Dan Moore scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins March 12, there is a good chance that at least four of the offensive linemen the Steelers have selected in the past two drafts will have a chance to start next season, with veteran guard Isaac Seumalo being the fifth starter. With so many young players in that group, it's not surprising that there were some struggles in 2024.

    "context": [
      "Both stations are owned by iHeartMedia . Games are also available on 51 radio stations in Pennsylvania , Western Maryland , Ohio , and Northern West Virginia . [ 218 ] The announcer is Tunch Ilkin . Craig Wolfley is the sideline reporter. Myron Cope , the longtime color analyst and inventor of the \" Terrible Towel \", retired after the 2004 season , and died in 2008. Longtime lead announcer Bill Hillgrove retired after the 2023 season . Pre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV , channel 2; independent sister station WPKD-TV , channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh . KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program Steelers Kickoff during the regular season prior to the national airing of The NFL Today . Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the Xfinity Xtra Point following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. Both Batch and Hoke replaced former Steelers lineman Edmund Nelson , who retired from broadcasting in 2015. [ 219 ] Thursday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on Fox affiliate WPGH-TV , channel 53 (along with home games with NFC opponents and some flexed interconference games), while ESPN Monday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on WTAE-TV , channel 4. (WTAE-TV is owned by the Hearst Corporation , which owns a 20% stake in ESPN.) By virtue of being members of the AFC, most of the Steelers' games air on CBS and KDKA.

Figures with broadcasting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s Main article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers figures in broadcasting The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope , who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons ( 1970 \u2013 2004 ). [ 220 ] Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. Newspaper The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. [ 221 ] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft",
      "broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk , both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst, [ 125 ] while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers . [ 126 ] Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps , Kevin Young , and Neil Walker . Past Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter , usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955. [ 127 ] Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] Nicknamed \"The Gunner,\" Prince was known for his \"Gunnerisms\"\u2014nicknames and quips\u2014and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC . Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince. [ 130 ] Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett , who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015. [ 131 ] Former analysts include Don Hoak , Nelson Briles , and Jim Rooker . Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass , who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.

I believe that is the best way to attempt to answer your question:\n\nFor a generation of sports fans in Western Pennsylvania, Myron Cope was a voice on their radio, a voice they invited into their homes nightly, a voice they turned to when they wanted to know something about their favorite football team. He was a voice they trusted. \"I've often thought that, when I kick the bucket, there'd be a story that said, 'Creator of towel, dead.'\" Cope cracked during the news conference called to announce his retirement on June 21, 2005. \"Truthfully, I was gifted and educated to be a writer.",

ANSWER: Van Jefferson is due to become an unrestricted free agent at 4 p.m. EST on March 12. CARL HASSENPLUG FROM NILES, OH: What do you think about hiring Jeff Saturday as offensive line coach? ANSWER: I don't think Jeff Saturday views his future as a coach as much as he does as a media personality. Remember, after he retired, while Saturday did some coaching at the high school level the direction of his career was as an ESPN personality covering the NFL. While at ESPN, Colts Owner Jim Irsay hired Saturday as an interim coach after Frank Reich was fired in what was a surprise move. Saturday went 1-7 as the Colts interim coach, and then he went back to ESPN and has had his role with the network expand. And Pat Meyer is currently the Steelers offensive line coach.

      "It's special. \"People messaged me because I also helped raise money for Cystic Fibrosis this offseason, and people will tell me their child has CF and what it meant to them. It's moments like that, messages like that, that makes it all worth it.\"\n\nWith the foundation still rather new, Kuntz loves the opportunity to bring attention to it through his cleats. \"That is going to be cool, especially because it's my own foundation and something I am proud of,\" said Kuntz. \"Every guy that is out there wearing their cleats has a special place in their heart for why they are wearing their cleats and it's all for a good reason.\"\n\nLogan Lee Cause: Athletes in Action\n\nLogan Lee has a long connection with Athletes in Action, which includes taking part in a service trip to Ecuador through Iowa's Athletes in Action when he was a student-athlete there. Lee, along with more than a dozen other athletes, distributed water filters to 86 families without access to clean water. \"In the villages, they had running water, but it was like muddy, muddy water,\" said Lee at the time. \"Many of the people just drank straight from it.\"\n\nIt was that trip, and many other moments with Athletes in Action, that made his decision to support them with his cleats an easy one. \"I've been impacted by them in so many ways,\" said Lee. \"I've been blessed in my life, and I want to share the initiative and help bring words to those in Athletes in Action who have helped me grow so much in my faith. \"I was a leader at Iowa's Athletes in Action for three years and they have a couple of camps that they run called the Ultimate Training Camp. Those have really helped me grow in my faith, allowed me to really just develop, develop my faith on a more intimate level and allow me to help apply faith to my sport while I'm participating. \"Not just praying before, not just praying after, but during the midst of competition, trying to stay with the Lord and make that a priority. \"The biggest thing is I've always had a great relationship with Christ. But by making that the number one priority and involving him in every area of my life, not making him just a subsector piece of my life, but involvement in everything I do.\"\n\nLee is thankful the NFL allows players to represent causes that are near and dear to them, not for their own benefit, but to bring rightful attention to worthwhile endeavors. \"It's awesome,\" said Lee. \"It's pretty neat being able to see so many guys find a nonprofit that has either helped them or that they feel passionate about and being able to help share that.

After composing herself, she continued to talk about her son Reid, who passed away in 2018 of leukemia at just 22-years old. \"It's pretty big,\" said Garrant. \"I miss my son. It happened so quickly when the whole leukemia thing happened. It was 16 hours from the time he was diagnosed until he died. It was crazy. \"My son Reid played with Pat and his brother, Timmy. My son was a senior when Pat was a freshman. We are from the same hometown, the same school. It just means so much.\"\n\nFreiermuth said he wanted to bring attention to Garrant and the foundation, hoping to help others battling the same disease, so he is wearing cleats to support them once again. \"It means a lot,\" said Freiermuth. \"Just being able to wear those cleats and put recognition to that foundation. Reid's mom has worked so hard to get her son's name out there. Being able to help in that process on a national stage like that is awesome. \"It is cool. The more eyes on the cleats, the better. That is what really helps the cause.\"\n\nOne of the things that touches Garrant's heart the most is that Reid was a Steelers fan his entire life and would have been overjoyed that Freiermuth was drafted by them. \"Reid's favorite team from the time he was born, he had no choice because of his dad, was the Steelers,\" said Garrant. \"He came out in black and gold. Pat doing this not only for his teammates, friends, family, our community and Reid's organization, it means so much. \"When he was drafted by the Steelers, it was a divine intervention. It means so much to me.",

Their mission is to bridge the financial disparity gap by providing knowledge, resources and opportunities to others. \"We started the foundation with a focus on financial literacy,\" said Anderson. \"Both of us have identified that a lot of people, especially in their early adult life, are distracted by trying to manage their finances and understand how to budget. Really simple principles that I think they would benefit greatly from if they learned those as early as possible. So, we try to target high school and middle school aged kids and just teach them fundamental financial literacy building blocks, like how to budget and what to do when you have a certain amount of money. When they get their first job, for example, they can build a structure that hopefully when they grow into having a professional income, that they have some understanding of what they want to do with their money so they can alleviate that stress and focus on the things that everybody has. Aptitudes that they are gifted with so they can focus on those things as opposed to figuring out how to do with finances.\"\n\nAnderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is. \"I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger,\" said Anderson. \"So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time.\"\n\nSpencer Anderson Cause: Autism Speaks",

Unfortunately, my son is not physically here, but I feel like spiritually he is going to be with us that day and see Pat with those cleats on fighting for kids with leukemia.\"\n\nNick Herbig Cause: HerbieGives\n\nNick Herbig was challenged when he was in college at the University of Wisconsin by his professor, award-winning instructor Don Stanley, to do a project for his media marketing class. It was from that project that Herbig came up with the idea for HerbieGives, something that started as a social media project that has turned into a non-profit along with his brother, Steelers center Nate Herbig, in Kaua'i, Hawaii. The purpose is to uplift student-athletes in Hawaii and transform lives through education and sports. And he is proud to share their cause on his cleats this year. \"It started in college because I had a class with Don Stanley, a media marketing class,\" said Herbig. \"We had to come up with a plan to market a foundation or a charitable cause. \"I always wanted to do something for back home, so I started the project as a way I can give back to my community. It started off as me just like posting stuff on an Instagram page I made. I was giving out information, because where we're from in Hawaii, there isn't a lot of information about getting to that next level. I was just trying to educate them with what camps you should be going to, how to go about your SAT's, all of that. \"That's how it started. And then it caught traction and turned into something bigger. When my brother and I went home last year, we got a chance to do a football camp. So that kind of blew it up even more. \"It keeps gaining more traction and it's something that I can be proud of.\"\n\nFor Herbig, giving back to where he is from is something that touches his heart and makes him beyond proud. \"The thing I've been blessed with throughout my journey, my career, is I wouldn't be here by myself,\" said Herbig."

The game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6\u20130 the previous six instances. [ 64 ] The 2022\u201323 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform. [ 65 ] This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. [ 66 ] However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005\u201306, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in dismissals of Burke and Hextall.

Prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favorite forward Jake Guentzel , trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes . [ 71 ] Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season When the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers , clinching the final spot as the second wild card. [ 72 ] Team information Crest and sweater design When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. [ 73 ] The team's colors were originally powder blue , navy blue , and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977.

It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building\u2014which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh\u2014his \u201cmonument,\u201d and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That\u2019s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International , second only to the Venice Biennale as the world\u2019s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum\u2019s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of \u201ccolossal\u201d prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. The first Carnegie International , 1896\n\nTo make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii , Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums\u2019 first major expansion in 1904. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture , perhaps best embodied Andrew Carnegie\u2019s desire to \u201cbring the world\u201d to the people of Pittsburgh. He knew that most of those people would never leave their neighborhoods, their city, let alone the country. So he created a room filled with the casts of some of the greatest architectural wonders of the world. The hall itself is modeled after one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and its rare collection of casts is the largest on display anywhere in the world today.

The museum was originally known as the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute and was formerly located at what is now the Main Branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. The museum's first gallery was opened for public viewing on November 5, 1895. Over the years, the gallery vastly increased in size, with a new building on Forbes Avenue built in 1907. In 1963, the name was officially changed to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute. The size of the gallery has tripled over time, and it was officially renamed in 1986 to \"Carnegie Museum of Art\" to indicate it clearly as one of the four Carnegie Museums . [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie first thought of setting up a museum in 1886 [ 2 ] that would preserve a \"record of the progress and development of pictorial art in America.\" Dedicated on November 5, 1895, the art gallery was initially housed in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's Main Branch in Oakland . Carnegie initially envisioned a museum collection consisting of the \" Old Masters of tomorrow\". [ 3 ] The museum received a major expansion in 1907 with the addition of the Hall of Architecture, Hall of Sculpture, and Bruce Galleries, with funds again provided by Carnegie. [ 4 ] Under the directorship of Leon A. Arkus, the Sarah Mellon Scaife Gallery (125,000 square feet) was built as an addition to the existing Carnegie Institute. Designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes , it first opened in 1974 and more than doubled the museum's exhibition space, also adding a children's studio, theater, caf\u00e9, offices, and bookstore. [ 5 ] The New York Times art critic John Russell described the gallery as an \"unflawed paradise.\" The gallery has been renovated several times since its original creation, most recently in 2004. Today the museum also stages the Carnegie International every few years. Numerous significant works from the Internationals have been acquired for museum's permanent collection including Winslow Homer 's The Wreck (1896) and James A.",

      "Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino will undergo initiation rites. Monostatos tries to kiss the sleeping Pamina but is surprised by the appearance of the Queen of the Night. The Queen gives her daughter a dagger and orders her to murder Sarastro. Sarastro finds the desperate Pamina and consoles her, explaining that he is not interested in vengeance. Tamino and Papageno are told by a priest that they must remain silent and are not allowed to eat, a vow that Papageno immediately breaks when he takes a glass of water from a flirtatious old lady. When he asks her name, the old lady vanishes. The three spirits appear to guide Tamino through the rest of his journey and to tell Papageno to be quiet. Tamino remains silent even when Pamina appears. Misunderstanding his vow for coldness, she is heartbroken. The priests inform Tamino that he has only two more trials to complete his initiation. Papageno, who has given up on entering the brotherhood, longs for a wife instead. He eventually settles for the old lady. When he promises to be faithful, she turns into a beautiful young Papagena, but immediately disappears. Pamina and Tamino are reunited and face the ordeals of water and fire together, protected by the magic flute. Papageno tries to poison himself\u00a0but is saved by the three spirits, who remind him that if he uses his magic bells he will find true happiness. When he plays the bells, Papagena appears and the two start making family plans.The Queen of the Night, her three ladies, and Monostatos attack the temple but are defeated and banished. Sarastro blesses Pamina and Tamino as all join in hailing the triumph of courage, virtue, and wisdom.

      "ACT I.Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (\u201cRecondita armonia\u201d). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (\u201cNon la sospiri la nostra casetta?\u201d). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (\u201cQual\u2019 occhio al mondo\u201d). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario\u2019s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (\u201cVa, Tosca!\u201d). ACT II.In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (\u201cHa pi\u00f9 forte sapore\u201d). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (\u201cVittoria!\u201d) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (\u201cVissi d\u2019arte\u201d). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and"

It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building\u2014which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh\u2014his \u201cmonument,\u201d and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That\u2019s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International , second only to the Venice Biennale as the world\u2019s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum\u2019s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of \u201ccolossal\u201d prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. The first Carnegie International , 1896\n\nTo make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii , Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums\u2019 first major expansion in 1904. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture , perhaps best embodied Andrew Carnegie\u2019s desire to \u201cbring the world\u201d to the people of Pittsburgh. He knew that most of those people would never leave their neighborhoods, their city, let alone the country. So he created a room filled with the casts of some of the greatest architectural wonders of the world. The hall itself is modeled after one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and its rare collection of casts is the largest on display anywhere in the world today.

Today, it\u2019s one of the most dynamic major art institutions in the country. Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\nAs one of the country\u2019s largest and most respected natural history museums, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plays a critical role in both the Pittsburgh region and the international scientific community by conducting research and presenting exhibitions and programs that highlight the interdependence of humanity and nature, and advocating for the protection of the earth and its inhabitants.

Carnegie Science Center\n\nCarnegie Science Center, soon to be the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center, is dedicated to inspiring learning and curiosity by connecting science and technology with everyday life. By making science both relevant and fun, the Science Center\u2019s goal is to increase science literacy in the region and motivate young people to seek careers in science and technology. As the region\u2019s most-visited museum, the Science Center reaches 500,000 people annually through hands-on exhibits, camps, classes, and off-site programs.

      "Use the hashtag #PghCCB to share your photos! In 1794, the newly formed Borough of Pittsburgh established a Public Market House in the current location of Market Square. Aside from creating the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's. The first City Hall at Market Square. The second City Hall on Smithfield Street. Mayor David Lawrence strikes the first blow for the demolition of the second City Hall. In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee.",

Completed in 1912, the Marshall mansion was an impressive formal 17th-Century Carolean-inspired building. In 1943, Charles Marshall also donated his house at 6300 Fifth Avenue to the city. The city was responsible for only the exterior maintenance. The Marshall mansion became the Arts and Crafts Center of Pittsburgh in 1945.

      "payments to artists were rectified and relationships with foundations were repaired. In January 2006, following votes by the Pittsburgh Filmmakers membership, Pittsburgh Center for the Arts board and Pittsburgh Filmmakers board, the merger of the two organizations became final. The Pittsburgh Filmmakers by-laws were carried over as the by-laws of the merged organization. In Fall 2010, the combined Pittsburgh Filmmakers /Pittsburgh Center for the Arts entered into merger discussions with the Pittsburgh Glass Center . [ 8 ] By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations. [ 8 ] Facilities [ edit ] Throughout the years many renovations were made at both the Marshall building, which houses the galleries, and the Scaife building, which houses the school. The last major renovation was to the Marshall building, which reopened March 24, 1990 with a dedication by Mayor Sophie Masloff to 800 guests, including Jane Marshall Fisher, granddaughter of the building's original donor. The center has a campus arrangement of four buildings, three of which (two mansions and a carriage house) are rented from the city for $1.00 per year. The fourth structure houses newly built kilns. PCA buildings [ edit ] For the industrialists in the early 1900s, a major living area was Pittsburgh's East End, where a building boom was underway. A parade of mansions were commissioned along Fifth Avenue to what became known as \u201cMillionaires Row\u201d for some of the wealthiest and most celebrated families in Pittsburgh, such as the Mellons, the Benedums, and the Fricks. In 1909, one of the most impressive mansions built was the 65-room Richard Beatty Mellon House on the 11 acres (4.5\u00a0ha) of land bordering Fifth Avenue, Shady Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard on what is now known as Mellon Park . Richard Beatty Mellon and his wife Jennie King Mellon raised two children, Sarah Cordelia King Mellon and Richard King Mellon . Jennie King Mellon had a love for flowers and had two very large flower gardens facing Beechwood Boulevard, which still exists in Mellon Park today. Next to the mansion was a garage and carriage house, which housed servants on the second floor. This carriage house was donated to the City and is now the Phipps Garden Center. The 65-room mansion was torn down in 1941. In 1904, there was another earlier Tudor revival mansion built on the Mellon Estate. It was given as a wedding gift in 1927 to Richard Beatty's daughter Sarah, who married Alan Magee Scaife, fifth generation industrialist and the Director of Mellon National Bank . In February 1946, the Scaifes also donated their home and property to the City. This mansion is now the Scaife Building that houses the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts School. Next door to the Mellon Estate, on the corner of Fifth and Shady Avenues, Charles D. Marshall, president and co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, which later became Bethlehem Steel , built his mansion. Completed"

    "question": "When was the first iron furnace in Pittsburgh established?",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]",
      "Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930. Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared\u2014a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "Iron City (1800\u20131859)\n\nCommerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]\n\nThe 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]\n\nOther emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east\u2013west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the \"City of bridges\" over its two rivers.[citation needed] On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.[27]\n\nManufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18\u00a0m) in diameter and 80 feet (24\u00a0m) high.[33]",
      "ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh. Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881. While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced. The union of the two men cemented their dominance over the Pittsburgh steel industry, and led to the eventual formation of United States Steel. In 1892, a labor dispute between Homestead Steel\u2014the nation\u2019s largest producer of steel, owned by Frick and Carnegie\u2014and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers\u2014its largest craft union\u2014escalated into a major, violent event. That summer, with Carnegie out of the country and the dispute still unresolved, Frick closed the mill, locking out 3,800 workers and intending to replace them with non-union employees. The union workers then seized the mill. Frick, in return, arranged for 300 armed Pinkerton detectives to travel by boat down the Ohio River, enter the mill on the river side and reclaim the building. Almost as soon as the detectives arrived, fighting began between both sides, resulting in loss of life for both steelworkers and Pinkerton detectives. It lasted for 12 hours, and eventually the Pennsylvania National Guard was ordered by the governor to intercede. The mill was secured and Homestead was placed under martial law. Henry Clay Frick showed an early interest in collecting paintings and drawings. In 1871, he applied for a loan of $10,000 from the bank of T. Mellon & Sons. The agent from the bank who was sent to investigate Frick\u2019s reliability commented that Frick \u201cmay be a little too enthusiastic about pictures, but not enough to hurt.\u201d By 1881 Frick had the resources to begin forming an art collection. His first recorded purchase of a painting was in February of that year. Frick chose a wooded landscape by local artist George Hetzel, who was a member of the Scalp Level School\u2014a group of regional painters who traveled to the countryside to sketch and paint in the manner of the French Barbizon School. Not long after that, Frick purchased other works, including At the Louvre (Une R\u00e9v\u00e9lation) by Spanish artist Luis Jim\u00e9nez y Aranda, a humorous, anecdotal painting of a young woman and her chaperone confronting a classical statue in the Louvre. Around 1885, after the Frick family was well-settled in Clayton, Frick began collecting in earnest. Much of this early purchasing focuses on French landscape painters of the Barbizon School, including Dessous de Bois (The Forest Floor) by Th\u00e9odore"

Fiery free-spirit\u00a0Carmen, who lives her life to the fullest, can have any man she wants. But when she seduces na\u00efve Corporal Don Jos\u00e9, she gets more than she bargains for. Carmen works in a cigarette factory. When a knife fight with another employee leads to her arrest, she charms Corporal Don Jos\u00e9 into letting her escape. Like a moth drawn to a flame, Don Jos\u00e9 forsakes his military career and the innocent peasant girl Mica\u00ebla for a life on the lam with Carmen and a band of smugglers. Never one to settle down, the passionate Carmen gets bored with Don Jos\u00e9 and becomes involved with the glamourous, testosterone-filled bullfighter Escamillo. Left with nothing, Don Jos\u00e9 decides that if he can\u2019t have Carmen, no one can.

Mica\u00ebla appears, frightened by the mountains and afraid to meet the woman who has turned Jos\u00e9 into a criminal (\"Je dis que rien ne m\u2019\u00e9pouvante\"). She hides when a shot rings out. Jos\u00e9 has fired at an intruder, who turns out to be Escamillo. He tells Jos\u00e9 that he has come to find Carmen, and the two men fight (\"Je suis Escamillo\"). The smugglers separate them, and Escamillo invites everyone, Carmen in particular, to his next bullfight. When he has left, Mica\u00ebla emerges and begs Jos\u00e9 to return home. He agrees when he learns that his mother is dying, but before he leaves he warns Carmen that they will meet again. ACT IV.Back in Seville, the crowd cheers the bullfighters on their way to the arena (\"A deux cuartos\"). Carmen arrives on Escamillo\u2019s arm, and Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s warn her that Jose is nearby. Unafraid, she waits outside the entrance as the crowds enter the arena. Jose appears and begs Carmen to forget the past and start a new life with him (\"C\u2019est toi! C\u2019est moi!\"). She calmly tells him that their affair is over: she was born free and free she will die. The crowd is heard cheering Escamillo. Jos\u00e9 keeps trying to win Carmen back. She takes off his ring and throws it at his feet before heading for the arena. Jos\u00e9 stabs her to death. Adapated fromOpera News",
      "Moral\u00e8s, another corporal, tells her he will return with the changing of the guard. The relief guard, headed by Lieutenant Zuniga, soon arrives, and Jos\u00e9 learns from Moral\u00e8s that Mica\u00ebla has been looking for him. When the factory bell rings, the men of Seville gather to watch the female workers\u2014 especially their favorite,\u00a0Carmen. She tells her admirers that love is free and obeys no rules (\"L\u2019amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). Only one man pays no attention to her: Don Jos\u00e9. Carmen throws a flower at him, and the girls go back to work. Jos\u00e9 picks up the flower and hides it when Mica\u00ebla returns. She brings a letter from Jos\u00e9\u2019s mother, who lives in a village in the countryside (\"Ma mere, je la vois\"). As he begins to read the letter, Mica\u00ebla leaves. Jos\u00e9 is about to throw away the flower when a fight erupts inside the factory between Carmen and another girl. Zuniga sends Jos\u00e9 to retrieve\u00a0Carmen. She\u00a0refuses to answer Zuniga\u2019s questions, and Jos\u00e9 is ordered to take her to prison. Left alone with him, she entices Jose with suggestions of a rendezvous at Lillas Pastia\u2019s tavern (\"Pr\u00e8s des remparts de S\u00e9ville\"). Mesmerized, he agrees to let her get away. As they leave for prison, Carmen escapes. Don Jos\u00e9 is arrested. ACT II.Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s entertain the guests at the tavern (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\"). Zuniga tells Carmen that Jos\u00e9 has just been released. The bullfighter Escamillo enters, boasting about the pleasures of his profession (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\"), and flirts with Carmen, who tells him that she is involved with someone else. After the tavern guests have left with Escamillo, the smugglers Danca\u00efre and Remendado explain their latest scheme to the women (\"Nous avons en t\u00eate une affaire\"). Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are willing to help, but Carmen refuses because she is in love. The smugglers withdraw as Jos\u00e9 approaches. Carmen arouses Jos\u00e9's\u00a0jealousy by telling him how she danced for Zuniga. She dances for him now, but when a bugle call is heard he says he must return to the barracks (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur\"). Carmen mocks him. To prove his love, Jos\u00e9 shows her the flower she threw at him and confesses how its scent made him not lose hope during the weeks in prison (\"La fleur que tu m\u2019avais jet\u00e9e\"). She is unimpressed: if he really loved her, he would desert the army and join her in a life of freedom in the mountains. Jos\u00e9 refuses, and Carmen tells him to leave. Zuniga bursts in, and in a jealous rage Jos\u00e9 fights him. The smugglers return and disarm Zuniga. Jos\u00e9 now has no choice but to join them. ACT III.Carmen and Jos\u00e9 quarrel in the smugglers\u2019 mountain hideaway. She admits that her love is fading and advises him to return to live with his mother. When Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s turn the cards to tell their fortunes, they foresee love and riches for themselves, but Carmen\u2019s cards spell death\u2014for her and for Jos\u00e9 (\"Melons!

Before long the scheming Bartolo enters the servants' quarters with his housekeeper, Marcellina, who wants Figaro to marry her to cancel a debt he cannot pay. After Marcellina and Susanna trade insults, the amorous page Cherubino arrives, reveling in his infatuation with all women. He hides when the Count shows up, furious because he caught Cherubino flirting with Barbarina, the gardener's daughter. The Count pursues Susanna but conceals himself when the gossiping music master Don Basilio approaches. The Count steps forward, however, when Basilio suggests that Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Almaviva is enraged further when he discovers Cherubino in the room. Figaro returns with fellow servants, who praise the Count's progressive reform in abolishing the droit de seigneur\u2014the right of a noble to take a manservant's place on his wedding night. Almaviva assigns Cherubino to his regiment in Seville and leaves Figaro to cheer up the unhappy adolescent. ACT II. In her boudoir, the Countess laments her husband's waning love but plots to chasten him, encouraged by Figaro and Susanna. They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a romantic assignation with the Count. Cherubino, smitten with the Countess, appears, and the two women begin to dress the page for his farcical rendezvous. While Susanna goes out to find a ribbon, the Count knocks at the door, furious to find it locked. Cherubino quickly hides in a closet, and the Countess admits her husband, who, when he hears a noise, is skeptical of her story that Susanna is inside the wardrobe. He takes his wife to fetch some tools with which to force the closet door. Meanwhile, Susanna, having observed everything from behind a screen, helps Cherubino out a window, then takes his place in the closet. Both Count and Countess are amazed to find her there. All seems well until the gardener, Antonio, storms in with crushed geraniums from a flower bed below the window. Figaro, who has run in to announce that the wedding is ready, pretends it was he who jumped from the window, faking a sprained ankle. Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio burst into the room waving a court summons for Figaro, which delights the Count, as this gives him an excuse to delay the wedding. ACT III. In an audience room where the wedding is to take place, Susanna leads the Count on with promises of a rendezvous in the garden. The Count, however, grows doubtful when he spies her conspiring with Figaro; the Count\u00a0vows revenge. Marcellina is astonished but thrilled to discover that Figaro is in fact her long-lost natural son by Bartolo. Mother and son embrace, provoking Susanna's anger until she too learns the truth. Finding a quiet moment, the Countess recalls her past happiness, then joins Susanna in composing a letter that invites the Count"

In 2004, through an agreement between the Jewish Federation Foundation, the RJA Advisory Committee, and the History Center, the RJA has become a program of the History Center, with the income from the RJA Endowment at the Jewish Federation Foundation has been directed to the History Center to support the work of the RJA.

    "question": "Who did the Count suspect Cherubino of having a crush on?",
    "context": [
      "ACT I. While preparing for their wedding, Figaro learns from Susanna that their philandering employer, Count Almaviva, has designs on her. At this news, the servant vows to outwit his master. Before long the scheming Bartolo enters the servants' quarters with his housekeeper, Marcellina, who wants Figaro to marry her to cancel a debt he cannot pay. After Marcellina and Susanna trade insults, the amorous page Cherubino arrives, reveling in his infatuation with all women. He hides when the Count shows up, furious because he caught Cherubino flirting with Barbarina, the gardener's daughter. The Count pursues Susanna but conceals himself when the gossiping music master Don Basilio approaches. The Count steps forward, however, when Basilio suggests that Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Almaviva is enraged further when he discovers Cherubino in the room. Figaro returns with fellow servants, who praise the Count's progressive reform in abolishing the droit de seigneur\u2014the right of a noble to take a manservant's place on his wedding night. Almaviva assigns Cherubino to his regiment in Seville and leaves Figaro to cheer up the unhappy adolescent. ACT II. In her boudoir, the Countess laments her husband's waning love but plots to chasten him, encouraged by Figaro and Susanna. They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a romantic assignation with the Count. Cherubino, smitten with the Countess, appears, and the two women begin to dress the page for his farcical rendezvous. While Susanna goes out to find a ribbon, the Count knocks at the door, furious to find it locked. Cherubino quickly hides in a closet, and the Countess admits her husband, who, when he hears a noise, is skeptical of her story that Susanna is inside the wardrobe. He takes his wife to fetch some tools with which to force the closet door. Meanwhile, Susanna, having observed everything from behind a screen, helps Cherubino out a window, then takes his place in the closet. Both Count and Countess are amazed to find her there. All seems well until the gardener, Antonio, storms in with crushed geraniums from a flower bed below the window. Figaro, who has run in to announce that the wedding is ready, pretends it was he who jumped from the window, faking a sprained ankle. Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio burst into the room waving a court summons for Figaro, which delights the Count, as this gives him an excuse to delay the wedding. ACT III. In an audience room where the wedding is to take place, Susanna leads the Count on with promises of a rendezvous in the garden. The Count, however, grows doubtful when he spies her conspiring with Figaro; the Count\u00a0vows revenge. Marcellina is astonished but thrilled to discover that Figaro is in fact her long-lost natural son by Bartolo. Mother and son embrace, provoking Susanna's anger until she too learns the truth. Finding a quiet moment, the Countess recalls her past happiness, then joins Susanna in composing a letter that invites the Count",
      "son embrace, provoking Susanna's anger until she too learns the truth. Finding a quiet moment, the Countess recalls her past happiness, then joins Susanna in composing a letter that invites the Count to the garden that night. Later, during the marriage ceremony of Figaro and Susanna, the bride manages to slip the note, sealed with a hatpin, to the Count, who pricks his finger, dropping the pin, which Figaro retrieves. ACT IV. In the moonlit garden, Barbarina, after unsuccessfully trying to find the lost hatpin, tells Figaro and Marcellina about the coming assignation between the Count and Susanna. Basilio counsels that it is wise to play the fool. Figaro inveighs against women and leaves, missing Susanna and the Countess, ready for their masquerade. Alone, Susanna rhapsodizes on her love for Figaro, but he, overhearing, thinks she means the Count. Susanna hides in time to see Cherubino woo the Countess\u2014now disguised in Susanna's dress\u2014until Almaviva chases him away and sends his wife, who he thinks is Susanna, to an arbor, to which he follows. By now Figaro understands the joke and, joining the fun, makes exaggerated love to Susanna in her Countess disguise. The Count returns, seeing, or so he thinks, Figaro with his wife. Outraged, he calls everyone to witness his judgment, but now the real Countess appears and reveals the ruse. Grasping the truth at last, the Count begs her pardon. All are reunited, and so ends this \"mad day\" at the Almaviva court. ~Adapted from Opera News",

Count Almaviva comes in disguise to the house of Doctor Bartolo and serenades Rosina, whom Bartolo keeps confined to the house. Figaro the barber, who knows all the town\u2019s secrets and scandals, explains to Almaviva that Rosina is Bartolo\u2019s ward, not his daughter, and that the doctor intends to marry her. Figaro devises a plan: the count will disguise himself as a drunken soldier with orders to be quartered at Bartolo\u2019s house so that he may gain access to Rosina. Almaviva is excited and Figaro looks forward to a nice cash pay-off. Rosina reflects on the voice that has enchanted her and resolves to use her considerable wiles to meet the man it belongs to\u2014as Almaviva has led her to believe, a poor student named Lindoro. Bartolo appears with Rosina\u2019s music master, Don Basilio. Basilio warns Bartolo that Count Almaviva, who has made known his admiration for Rosina, has been seen in Seville. Bartolo decides to marry Rosina immediately. Basilio suggests slander as the most effective means of getting rid of Almaviva. Figaro, who has overheard the plot, warns Rosina and promises to deliver a note from her to Lindoro. Bartolo suspects that Rosina has indeed written a letter, but she outwits him at every turn. Bartolo warns her not to trifle with him. Almaviva arrives, creating a ruckus in his disguise as a drunken soldier, and secretly passes Rosina his own note. Bartolo is infuriated by the stranger\u2019s behavior and noisily claims that he has an official exemption from billeting soldiers. Figaro announces that a crowd has gathered in the street, curious about the argument they hear coming from inside the house. The civil guard bursts in to arrest Almaviva, but when he secretly reveals his true identity to the captain he is instantly released. Everyone except Figaro is amazed by this turn of events. ACT II",
      "Bartolo suspects that the \u201csoldier\u201d was a spy planted by Almaviva. The count returns, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a music teacher and student of Don Basilio, to give Rosina her singing lesson in place of Basilio, who, he says, is ill at home. \u201cDon Alonso\u201d then tells Bartolo that when visiting Almaviva at his inn, he found a letter from Rosina. He offers to tell her that it was given to him by another woman, seemingly to prove that Lindoro is toying with Rosina on Almaviva\u2019s behalf. This convinces Bartolo that \u201cDon Alonso\u201d is indeed a student of the scheming Basilio, and he allows him to give Rosina her lesson. With Bartolo dozing off, Almaviva and Rosina declare their love. Figaro arrives to give Bartolo his shave and manages to snatch the key that opens the doors to Rosina\u2019s balcony. Suddenly Basilio shows up looking perfectly healthy. Almaviva, Rosina, and Figaro convince him with a quick bribe that he is in fact ill and must go home at once. While Bartolo gets his shave, Almaviva plots with Rosina to meet at her balcony that night so that they can elope. But the doctor overhears them and realizing he has been tricked again, flies into a rage. Everyone disperses. The maid Berta comments on the crazy household. Bartolo summons Basilio, telling him to bring a notary so Bartolo can marry Rosina that very night. Bartolo then shows Rosina her letter to Lindoro, as proof that he is in league with Almaviva. Heartbroken and convinced that she has been deceived, Rosina agrees to marry Bartolo. A thunderstorm passes. Figaro and the count climb a ladder to Rosina\u2019s balcony and let themselves in with the key. Rosina appears and confronts Lindoro, who finally reveals his true identity as Almaviva. Basilio shows up with the notary. Bribed and threatened, he agrees to be a witness to the marriage of Rosina and Almaviva. Bartolo arrives with soldiers, but it is too late. He accepts that he has been beaten, and Figaro, Rosina, and the count celebrate their good fortune.

      "ACT I.Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (\u201cRecondita armonia\u201d). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (\u201cNon la sospiri la nostra casetta?\u201d). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (\u201cQual\u2019 occhio al mondo\u201d). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario\u2019s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (\u201cVa, Tosca!\u201d). ACT II.In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (\u201cHa pi\u00f9 forte sapore\u201d). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (\u201cVittoria!\u201d) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (\u201cVissi d\u2019arte\u201d). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and"

      "\u00a9 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. Andy Warhol\u2019s Amiga Digital Art\n\nIn 1985, the electronics company Commodore introduced the world to the then-revolutionary Amiga 1000 personal computer. Amid great fanfare that featured a full orchestra and tuxedo-clad employees, the PC took center stage at New York City\u2019s Lincoln Center, accompanied by two revolutionaries in their own right\u2014Andy Warhol and Blondie\u2019s Debbie Harry. Never one to miss an opportunity to explore uncharted media, Warhol eagerly took on his new role as a Commodore brand ambassador. His assignment that day: Use the Amiga\u2019s ProPaint software to create a portrait of Harry in real time in front of a live audience. Warhol accomplished that goal, and more. For decades, 28 of his digital works\u2014among them, two self-portraits and the untitled renderings of a banana and Campbell\u2019s soup can\u2014existed only on floppy disks stored within The Warhol\u2019s archives. Then in 2014, the museum, artist Cory Arcangel, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s computer club set out to rescue the paintings from their decadeslong purgatory. After painstakingly reverse-engineering the program, the CMU squad revived Warhol\u2019s digital images. In May 2021, five of them were minted and auctioned as nonfungible tokens by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. and Christie\u2019s.",

      "Andrew, by Andy\n\nWith Richard Mellon Scaife\u2019s support, in 1981 Carnegie Museum of Art commissioned Pittsburgh\u2019s most famous artist to create a portrait of Carnegie Museums\u2019 founder. It\u2019s only fitting that it be Andy Warhol, who attended Saturday art classes at Carnegie Museum of Art and studied painting and design at what\u2019s now Carnegie Mellon University\u2014both institutions established by Andrew Carnegie. The artist based his silkscreen of the complex figure on a photograph taken in 1896 by celebrated Pittsburgh photographer B.L.H. Dabbs. Warhol created two versions and both are in the museum\u2019s collection. This one was a gift of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts following Warhol\u2019s death. Screened in vibrant complementary colors, the works give the buttoned-down look of the steel magnate something akin to an electric charge. Warhol: Resources & Lessons English-Russian Workbook\n\nOver 25 years, the keepers of the Andy Warhol flame have brought his art to more than 40 countries, reaching some 12 million people. In a particularly remarkable exchange, in 2005 The Warhol traveled the exhibition Andy Warhol: Artist of Modern Life to three major Russian cities. With support from the Alcoa Foundation, the museum established an educational partnership with the host institutions in Russia, which included the translation of educational resources, like this workbook, and a collaboration between students in Moscow and Pittsburgh. The project galvanized nearly a decade\u2019s worth of work by The Warhol\u2019s education department to create a free, and still evolving, online curriculum using Warhol\u2019s life, art, and practice to teach lessons across the humanities. An Educational Kit: The Hopi Tribe\n\nFor nearly 125 years, the Museum of Natural History\u2019s Educator Loan Collection, the brainchild of early Museum Director William J. Holland, has introduced area teachers and students to real, touchable artifacts and specimens of the natural world\u2014from minerals and skulls to feathers, furs, and taxidermy. Themed by topic into tool kits\u2014think dinosaurs, minerals, and Pennsylvania botany\u2014 additions to the now 8,000-plus collection are often donated by the museum\u2019s scientific sections because they\u2019re lacking sufficient data for scientific study. They\u2019re no less valuable, though, as educational tools for K\u201312 learners.

And the dinosaur and the painting that started it all. To celebrate 125 years of Carnegie Museums, Carnegie magazine published the stories of 125 iconic, quirky, and sometimes little-known pieces of museum history\u201425 objects at a time throughout our anniversary year. Explore the tales of these unique wonders of art, science, and the natural world, as well as a few other unforgettable markers of Carnegie Museums past and present\u2014randomly, by museum, or by object type. |\n\nText Size:\n\nSelect objects by thumbnail or filter objects\n\nDinosaur Hall\u2019s T. rex Mural\n\nFor decades, visitors flocked to Carnegie Museum of Natural History\u2019s original Dinosaur Hall to see its resident VIPs\u2014 Diplodocus carnegii, Apatosaurus louisae, and Tyrannosaurus rex . They left with a dark and foreboding image baked into their brains, painted in 1950 by the museum\u2019s chief artist, Ottmar von Fuehrer. The floor-to-ceiling mural took the Carnegie Tech-trained artist months to complete, and museum visitors got to watch as the depiction of the fierce creature took shape. Part T. rex , part Godzilla, the lumbering dinosaur was based on the science of the day. Later that century, scientists learned that T. rex moved with its back held almost horizontal, with its powerful jaws just a few feet above eye level and its tail raised well off the ground. So, von Fuehrer\u2019s mural had to go. But his work is still on view today\u2014from the painting of Mt.",
      "T. rex Holotype\n\nDespite their relatively puny arms, Tyrannosaurus rex had the jaw-dropping power of a 40-foot-long, 5-ton body. And their spiky teeth were sharp, efficient, and deadly. Roaming what is today the western U.S. and southwestern Canada in search of food, the meat-eating T. rex ruled some 68 to 66 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period. But it wasn\u2019t until 1902 that the holotype\u2014the scientific name-bearing specimen and the one to which all others must be compared\u2014was unearthed at Hell Creek, Montana. At the turn of the century, the competition among museums to discover and display dinosaur fossils was fierce. Young fossil hunter Barnum Brown was hired by New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History to lead its charge, and he did not disappoint. Over three years, he unearthed what was at the time a whole new species of dinosaur. But it didn\u2019t take long before Brown moved on to bigger and better findings. His 1908 excavation of a more complete T. rex skeleton prompted the museum to move the holotype into storage, and in 1941, with a dwindling research budget, the American Museum sold the T. rex holotype to Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The price? $7,000 ($130,000 in today\u2019s currency) for what is by definition the first fossil of the world\u2019s most famous dinosaur.

      "\u201cThere are photos from the unveiling where there are people shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d says Lamanna. Back in Pittsburgh, big things were in the works. \u201cMultiple sources cite the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and Carnegie\u2019s desire to display its mounted skeleton as a major driving force behind the construction of an expanded Carnegie Institute building,\u201d says Lamanna. In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall. Diplodocus carnegii finally had a forever home. \u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d says Tom Rea, author of Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Dinosaur . The display of real fossils\u2014not just casts\u2014is what made it momentous, explains Rea. Before long, word of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus spread like wildfire. And everybody wanted a piece. Dippy\u2019s World Tour\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the largest and most respected museums in the world were only just beginning to catch dino-fever. \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing time in science when you think about it,\u201d says Rea. \u201cThese were all temples of science,\u201d adds Rea, who is also editor and founder of WyoHistory.org, a project of the Wyoming Historical Society. \u201cThese big halls, with high ceilings and dramatic arches, and daylight coming down through the clerestory, and all that stuff that makes these spaces so fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nBut most of them had nothing like a Diplodocus . So when requests started to pour in from abroad, Carnegie again seized the moment. Before long, casts would be sent to some of the largest cities in the world. According to Rea, Berlin erected its Diplodocus cast in March 1908. Paris followed suit that June. The following year, Vienna and Bologna joined the trend, and then St. Petersburg in 1910, La Plata, Argentina, in 1912, Madrid in 1913, and Mexico City in 1930. For the vast majority of museumgoers of the day, it would be the first dinosaur they\u2019d ever laid eyes upon. \u201cThe cool thing about that is, most of these casts are still on display,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cWhen you think about all the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people that see Diplodocus carnegii casts every year in all these European cities, in Latin [and South] America, and couple that with the fact that these mounts have been on display in many cases for more than a century,\u201d says Lamanna, \u201cthis is probably the most-seen dinosaur specimen in the history of the planet.\u201d\n\nThe House That Dippy Built",

      "\u201cIn the limited time I have on this planet I want to make the most scientifically significant fossil discoveries I can. I want to try to improve humanity\u2019s knowledge of dinosaurs as much as I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have this weird mix of emotions,\u201d he said, 29 hours prior to departing from his home just north of Pittsburgh in mid-February. \u201cThe last time I was there I was 32. I\u2019m 47 now. Do I still have what it takes to do this?\u201d\n\nHis 1998 trip to the Estancia Laguna Palacios was Lamanna\u2019s first international dinosaur expedition, and one that was transformative for him, personally and professionally. He developed deep friendships with the Argentinian paleontologists he worked with and began a scientific collaboration that has helped shape his career. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers,\u201d Lamanna said of his Argentinian colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m very much a guest on their project. I think I may add a little in terms of scientific expertise, I guess that\u2019s why they keep inviting me back\u2014though I think they might enjoy my company just a little bit, too. Either way, it\u2019s a privilege to be invited to do these kinds of things.\u201d\n\nTwo other associates from the museum\u2014Kara Fikse and Linsly Church\u2014joined Lamanna to document the journey, search for fossils, and help preserve any discoveries. Every fossil discovered stayed in Argentina so scientists there could continue to study them. Return Engagement",
      "Lamanna, Fikse, and Church walked along the same area, up a hillside, dispersing in a flat area against clementine-tinted cliffs. They were exploring a group of rocks called the Bajo Barreal Formation, a fossilized ecosystem that preserves dinosaurs and other animals that lived in what\u2019s now central Patagonia about 95 million years ago. As the wind began to pick up, Lamanna noticed something half buried in the dirt. \u201cI think I was at the site for about a minute or less, and I looked down and I saw a small piece of bone sticking partly out of the ground,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI realized right away it was part of a meat-eating dinosaur. Given where this bone was found, and the anatomical appearance of the bone, it\u2019s a virtual certainty it belonged to that same megaraptorid specimen we discovered 25 years ago!\u201d\n\nLamanna soon would identify his find as a foot bone, a piece of evidence that puts the team one step closer to being able to fully envision the dinosaur from the fossils they have and, eventually, name it. \u201cIt was really wild to go back to a site that was so foundational for me, not only in my work in Patagonia but in a lot of my research since then,\u201d he says. \u201cTo come back a quarter century later and find another bone of this thing was absolutely unexpected because we thought we\u2019d gotten it all. We were really fired up.\u201d\n\nHistory-Making Find\n\nBy the final week, the expedition had already been deemed a success. The team had made several key discoveries\u2014including bones of three different dinosaur species\u2014when two of the Argentinian scientists unearthed another history-making fossil. The group had moved to a new area, the R\u00edo Chico headwaters, where the rock formations date back roughly 70 million years. \u201cWe get these two brief windows into dinosaurs that lived about 70 and 95 million years ago, respectively, in this part of Patagonia,\u201d Lamanna says. They camped in a valley in the R\u00edo Chico region just in time for the most challenging weather of the trip.",
      "International Collaboration\n\nFinding a dinosaur bone in the ground is only the first step in what is often a years-long journey in understanding what a fossil is and where it fits into the broader record of life on Earth. This long and arduous adventure of fossil study and preservation begins in the lab. In the middle of their Patagonia trip, the team decamped to the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia. There, Lamanna and his Argentinian collaborators, including Lucio Ibiricu, study discoveries from the field. Lamanna (left) and fossil preparator Marcelo Luna in the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia. \u201cWe share a lot of ideas about papers and projects, so we are going to continue in this line,\u201d Ibiricu says. \u201cWe are sure that we are going to continue working with Matt for several years, sharing field seasons, papers, projects, and hopefully sharing students to increase their experience.\u201d\n\nAs investments in paleontology labs and student training in Argentina continue to grow, more discoveries will follow. \u201cBy working together, the scientific impact we can make is potentially very significant,\u201d Lamanna says. Because of how Earth has evolved, Cretaceous dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere are usually quite different from their northern counterparts, having evolved along separate evolutionary pathways for tens of millions of years after the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. Most of the field team that worked in the R\u00edo Chico headwaters area.",
      "Strong winds kicked up swirls of dust, which got everywhere\u2014in tents, in sleeping bags, in socks. Everyone wore ski goggles. Gabriel Casal (right) and Matt Lamanna (center) make a protective plaster and burlap jacket around several bones of the new titanosaur skeleton at the Estancia Laguna Palacios. On the first day of the R\u00edo Chico dig, two Argentinian students unearthed a Cretaceous-aged mammal fossil, the only one ever found in the region. The students, Noelia Cardozo and Ivanna Mora, have been training in the lab led by paleontologists Gabriel Casal, Lucio Ibiricu, and Andrea De Sosa Tomas. The unassuming fossil was an upper jawbone of a rodent-sized mammal containing at least four tiny teeth. The whole fossil is only about the width of a thumbnail. It belongs to a now-extinct mammal called a meridiolestidan. During this time, mammals lived in the shadows of larger dinosaurs and so mostly remained comparatively small in size, Lamanna notes. Sharing those discoveries with the rest of the world, even as the team was finding them, was Kara Fikse\u2019s job. Fikse, director of donor engagement and stewardship at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, documented the journey and facilitated live video streams viewed by hundreds of people across the U.S., Canada, France, and Australia. Kara Fikse\n\nThe aim was to give the public a behind-the-scenes view of what it was like to be a dinosaur scientist. She said that witnessing it firsthand was striking. \u201cEveryone\u2019s face was streaked with dirt, everyone was just genuinely excited to be working together out there in the field,\u201d Fikse recollects. \u201cAnd from the scientific aspect, whenever they found something, that sort of emotion of excitement and passion for the work they were doing was pretty contagious.\u201d\n\nIt was all a new experience for Linsly Church, curatorial assistant for vertebrate paleontology at the Museum of Natural History. \u201cThis was an exciting opportunity to go on my first expedition and my first trip to Argentina,\u201d Church says. \u201cI was looking forward to learning more about how fossils are found, stabilized, and removed from the ground. It was a great experience and I got to meet and work with so many wonderful people!\u201d\n\nMatt Lamanna and Linsly Church\n\nDuring the expedition she learned to apply plaster-soaked burlap strips over the fossils to protect them when they were uncovered, and helped to dig the trenches needed in order to extract each bone. At the R\u00edo Chico, she found a toe bone of another new megaraptorid species that had been previously found at the site. It was one of many discoveries, including parts of duck-billed dinosaurs and turtles, that made the expedition so successful. The new mammal fossil discovered by the Argentinian students was especially groundbreaking. \u201cBy itself, this fossil would\u2019ve made our expedition a smashing success,\u201d Lamanna exclaims. \u201cThe fact that we also found parts of four different dinosaur species put it totally over the top.\u201d\n\nInternational Collaboration",
      "The Estancia Laguna Palacios looked just the way Lamanna had remembered it. \u201cEstancia\u201d translates to \u201cranch\u201d in Spanish, and the terrain looks a lot like a sunlit surface of the moon\u2014a barren, windy plain with jagged rocks, eroded buttes, and spires in an array of rose, slate, and burgundy. The landscape is like Badlands National Park in South Dakota, but with rocks that are tens of millions of years older. Located in the Chubut Province of Argentina, part of central Patagonia, the region has become well known among paleontologists for its dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous Period, the last period in the age of dinosaurs. Most days began about an hour\u2019s drive from the group\u2019s hostel-like cabin in the village of Buen Pasto, where the teams slept in bunk beds and shared dinners after each day\u2019s work. The team\u2019s campsite at Valle Joaqu\u00edn, near the R\u00edo Chico headwaters, where they collected additional bones of a 70-million-year-old megaraptorid. The primary mission was to uncover an elephant-sized, long-necked, plant-eating sauropod dinosaur known as a titanosaur. Thanks to a discovery years prior, Lamanna and his colleagues knew there was part of a skeleton buried in the area, and they were going to try to recover it. The titanosaur turned out to be much more complete than the researchers initially thought, preserving vertebrae from the neck, trunk, and hips, plus several large pelvic and limb bones. But on the fourth day of the expedition, they stumbled on an unexpected find. Lamanna, Fikse, and Church were revisiting a spot the team first canvassed on its 1998 trip where they discovered a probable new species of meat-eating dinosaur, called a megaraptorid theropod, although not enough of the specimen to be able to name it. Known for their powerful forelimbs tipped by enormous claws, megaraptorids are still something of a mystery to paleontologists, who have yet to find a complete skeleton. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a little bit frustrating,\u201d Lamanna admits. They went back in 2000 to dig more and believed they had collected \u201ceverything there was to collect.\u201d\n\nThat the skeleton remained incomplete is not unusual. Most of the time, when paleontologists discover a dinosaur, they don\u2019t come close to finding the whole thing. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily rare to find a dinosaur that\u2019s even 75 percent complete,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see these fully mounted skeletons in museums, even the best of them almost always have a few reconstructed parts.\u201d\n\nCarnegie Museum of Natural History has one of the most extensive sauropod collections in the world, but even the best of those skeletons isn\u2019t totally complete. As a result, \u201cour understanding of these dinos does often build up incrementally,\u201d Lamanna says. Titanosaur femur and tibia in a quarry. The day of the unexpected find at the ranch was a sunny one."

      "Statue of Jesus by Andy Warhol\n\nNot long after Andy Warhol\u2019s passing, staff at The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (and, upon its founding in 1994, The Andy Warhol Museum) started sorting through and cataloging the many things Warhol left behind, including his 610 Time Capsules . Most of the Time Capsules are cardboard boxes filled with newspaper clippings, day planners, bills, ticket stubs, handwritten letters\u2014life\u2019s detritus. Stashed inside them is no shortage of material clues of the artist\u2019s Byzantine Catholic influences, including family prayer books and prayer cards, souvenirs from Pope Paul VI\u2019s 1965 visit to New York City, and mementos from Warhol\u2019s 1980 visit to the Vatican, where he met Pope John Paul II in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Many of these deeply personal items were on display for the first time in The Warhol\u2019s 2019 exhibition Andy Warhol: Revelation , which explored the connection between Catholicism and the artist\u2019s body of work. A very special addition, on loan from the John Warhola family, was this chalkware plaster statue of Jesus that Warhol painted when he was between 10 and 13 years old, taking great care to detail the crucifixion wounds on the hands of Christ and color the Sacred Heart a deep red. Ivory Eagle\n\nA majestic, life-size ivory eagle that H.J. Heinz purchased in Japan a century ago was returned to its original splendor in 2013 thanks to Carnegie Museum of Natural History conservators, work that took two months and occurred while curious museumgoers looked on. The Pittsburgh ketchup magnate bought the bird by an unknown artist in Yokohama in 1913 during one of several trips he made to China and Japan. When the sculpture and its custom case, together weighing 550 pounds, arrived at the museum in 1913, Assistant Director Douglas Stewart deemed it \u201cthe finest specimen of its kind in the world.\u201d It was valued then at $5,000 and was a favorite of visitors until it went off view in the 1990s. It was restored in preparation for a Carnegie Museum of Art exhibition featuring both ivory sculptures and Japanese woodblock prints, many collected and donated to the museums by Heinz. With its 48-inch wingspan and hundreds of feathers, some the size of a quarter and the length of a dinner fork, the ivory eagle remains on view in a prominent spot at the base of the Oakland complex\u2019s Grand Staircase. Conservators removed from it mostly sooty air pollution that had accumulated during Pittsburgh\u2019s industrial era.

Astronaut Mike Fincke\u2019s T-shirt\n\nAstronaut and Emsworth native Mike Fincke has logged nearly 382 days in orbit during his three space missions.

That towel, along with the \u201cI Love Carnegie Science Center, Pittsburgh, PA\u201d T-shirt he wore while aboard the International Space Station, has since landed in the Science Center\u2019s SpacePlace exhibit, which also features the hometown hero\u2019s flight suits, gloves, watches, flip charts, and mission books.

Carnegie Museum of Art\u2019s Neapolitan presepio shows merchants selling their wares, a marching band in full stride, animals mingling among the residents, both human and heavenly\u2014some seemingly oblivious to the newborn Christ child and his parents. Popularized in the 18th century, presepi were often commissioned by wealthy Neapolitans to celebrate one of the most important holidays in the Catholic faith, situated within present-day Naples. The craftmanship of the day remains impressive some 300 years later, from the textiles used\u2014including silk damask and denim twill\u2014to the tiny props of cheeses molded from clay and fruits and vegetables sculpted in wax. For the past 65 years and counting, the day after Thanksgiving marks the unveiling of this annual exhibition.

    "question": "In which year was the first coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh. Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881. While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced. The union of the two men cemented their dominance over the Pittsburgh steel industry, and led to the eventual formation of United States Steel. In 1892, a labor dispute between Homestead Steel\u2014the nation\u2019s largest producer of steel, owned by Frick and Carnegie\u2014and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers\u2014its largest craft union\u2014escalated into a major, violent event. That summer, with Carnegie out of the country and the dispute still unresolved, Frick closed the mill, locking out 3,800 workers and intending to replace them with non-union employees. The union workers then seized the mill. Frick, in return, arranged for 300 armed Pinkerton detectives to travel by boat down the Ohio River, enter the mill on the river side and reclaim the building. Almost as soon as the detectives arrived, fighting began between both sides, resulting in loss of life for both steelworkers and Pinkerton detectives. It lasted for 12 hours, and eventually the Pennsylvania National Guard was ordered by the governor to intercede. The mill was secured and Homestead was placed under martial law. Henry Clay Frick showed an early interest in collecting paintings and drawings. In 1871, he applied for a loan of $10,000 from the bank of T. Mellon & Sons. The agent from the bank who was sent to investigate Frick\u2019s reliability commented that Frick \u201cmay be a little too enthusiastic about pictures, but not enough to hurt.\u201d By 1881 Frick had the resources to begin forming an art collection. His first recorded purchase of a painting was in February of that year. Frick chose a wooded landscape by local artist George Hetzel, who was a member of the Scalp Level School\u2014a group of regional painters who traveled to the countryside to sketch and paint in the manner of the French Barbizon School. Not long after that, Frick purchased other works, including At the Louvre (Une R\u00e9v\u00e9lation) by Spanish artist Luis Jim\u00e9nez y Aranda, a humorous, anecdotal painting of a young woman and her chaperone confronting a classical statue in the Louvre. Around 1885, after the Frick family was well-settled in Clayton, Frick began collecting in earnest. Much of this early purchasing focuses on French landscape painters of the Barbizon School, including Dessous de Bois (The Forest Floor) by Th\u00e9odore",
      "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture",
      "When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s."

    "question": "What historical installations are being preserved in the renovation of Point State Park?",
    "context": [
      "Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum. Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing centre for the Federal government during the Civil War , under the charge of William Metcalf . Museum [ edit ] Main article: Point State Park Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources , announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination. Plans for improving the park are well underway. They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs. Currently (April 2011) the waterfront area is closed to pedestrians as the stone walkways and wharf area are being resurfaced. They are to be reopened during the summer, 2011. [ 2 ] These plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, thirteen members of two different locals labour unions were arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The labour union protested the use of four non-labour workers by the contractor responsible for completing the work at Point State Park. [1] On August 14, 2009, the state closed the museum and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Management of the museum is supposed to be taken over by Senator John Heinz Regional History Center once the state budget is passed. [ 3 ] The Senator John Heinz History Center reopened the Fort Pitt Museum on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The History Center's museum system also includes a Smithsonian-affiliated, seven-story museum in Pittsburgh's Strip District;  Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America located in Avella, Pa.; and the Western",

The Frick Pittsburgh will\n\nconsult with Black\n\nstakeholders and people\n\nof color to learn about and\n\nrepresent the interests of\n\ndiverse audiences in our\n\nexhibitions, educational\n\nprograms, communications,\n\nmuseum store, and food\n\nservices. 7. The Frick Pittsburgh will expand our\n\nprofessional networks to include diverse\n\norganizations, such as the African American\n\nChamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania,\n\nwhich can help us expand our partnerships,\n\naudiences, and applicant pools. 8. We pledge to develop strategies to diversify\n\nour leadership and board within the period\n\ncovered by our Strategic Plan (2020-2027). ten weeks after making these\n\ncommitments, the Frick has embarked\n\non the journey to honor them. We began with an informal  listening session with\n\nour staff, at which we were joined by Cecile Shellman,\n\nour DEAI consultant, and Jane Zwier, a licensed\n\nprofessional counselor with  our Employee\n\nAssistance Program. Next, our entire staff completed virtual seminars on\n\nthe subject of empathy, followed by online classes in\n\nverbal conflict de-escalation techniques\u2014\n\nopportunities that have empowered us to approach all\n\ninteractions with compassion and clear\n\ncommunication. Our DEAI committee, formed in 2019 under the\n\nleadership of interim director Judith Hansen O\u2019Toole,\n\nis finalizing a charter structuring its ongoing work\n\nand its members\u2019 terms of service. The committee\n\nhas laid out a robust schedule of projects, including an\n\nall-employee virtual anti-racism workshop in September. Our Board of Trustees has met twice with the Frick\u2019s\n\nDEAI consultant, first to review plans and progress and\n\nthen to participate in an anti-racism workshop. Our Learning & Visitor Experience department is\n\ncontinuing to expand our educational community\n\npartnerships. In August, we welcomed to our campus\n\na group of socially distanced summer campers from\n\nSouth Pittsburgh\u2019s youth anti-violence organization\n\nVoices Against Violence to create an anti-racist art\n\ninstallation on the Frick grounds. We have begun asking our vendors to share informa-\n\ntion about their diversity and racial equity plans, and\n\nare ensuring that all searches for positions, services,\n\nand suppliers include Black and minority finalists. Our curatorial department is in the throes of developing\n\nThe Frick Reflects exhibition, examining both the social\n\nand art history of our collections and our institution\u2019s\n\nfounding.

      "URL: https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/biographies/musicians/orchard-jennifer TITLE: Orchard Jennifer CONTENT: Jennifer Orchard First Violin \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when I was not playing the violin,\u201d says Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra violinist Jennifer Orchard. The statement reflects on her earliest memories of music, but it speaks to a larger truth about this gifted artist: Life and music have always been joined as she lives out her life passion every day. Orchard\u2019s biography spans all of the rites of passage that come with attaining the status of a world-class musician\u2014the childhood successes the rigors of conservatory training, and the progress of a professional career. Yet the conventional narrative does not capture the more complete picture of Orchard, who has a heartfelt love for the beauty of music and a sense of purpose as she brings it to life. Orchard came to the violin as a young child and grew rapidly. Her early success led to admission into the Curtis Institute of Music and The Juilliard School, where she honed the skills that would lead to a professional career. She speaks with reverence of her teachers, including famed violinists Szymon Goldberg, Robert Mann and Lorand Fenyves, who helped her achieve both virtuosity and artistry. From her conservatory studies, Orchard entered her first professional position as a member of the Lark Quartet. She played with Lark for eight years, from 1993-2001 and while there began a recording career that continues to this day. Now a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony first violin section, Orchard channels her artistic endeavors through many avenues. In 2015, she and three other PSO musicians formed the Clarion Quartet which commits itself to performance and awareness of composers whose lives and careers were destroyed through the atrocities of WWII. These composers, deemed degenerate by the Nazi party have been neglected and largely forgotten since the war. The Clarion Quartet\u2019s mission is to break the silence and restore this music to its rightful place on the stages of today. Their recording of three such composers came out in 2018 and is available on Naxos. Orchard\u2019s recording work also includes partnering with pianist Igor Kraevsky on the music of Paul Juon, a Russian composer whose works were also, though not through war, neglected and largely unknown. Orchard and Kraevsky\u2019s work together has spanned fifteen plus years, performing the world premiere of Paul Juon\u2019s Triple concerto in Moscow Conservatory Hall and producing many recordings including two world premieres entitled Weisse Nachte and Bagatellen. Orchard expresses a sincere and humble gratitude for having had the opportunity in her life to play with great musicians and for appreciative audiences, which is the fulfillment of a life mission. As for how she articulates that personal mission, she says without hesitation: \u201cTo always have passion about the music, and to never stop playing.\u201d"

      "The South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixed-use development. The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night.

The Employers\u2019 portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insurance premiums, retirement plan contributions, etc., are not part of taxable gross payroll.

Passive Income of a Self-employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax.

As such, City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety personnel from all of the bureaus will be in place to help provide a safe and fun experience for everyone in what is expected to be a large turnout,\u201d said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich.

Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]\n\nShannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]",
      "Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]",
      "Contents\n\nHistory of Pittsburgh\n\nThe history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Ja\u00f6deog\u00eb\u2019 in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s.",
      "Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000\u00a0acres (800\u00a0km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130\u00a0km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt.",
      "They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]\n\nAfrican Americans\n\nThe years 1916\u20131940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.[63][64]\n\nHistorian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:\n\nThe newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:\n\nThe cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.[39]\n\n1930s\n\nPittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,[67] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.[68][69]"

First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis\n\nwill be utilized to build this continuum. Implementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to\n\ncommunity needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders\n\nhave significant exposure to issues that affect community members\u2019 health and well-being. OCH&S will work with\n\nthe Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and\n\nresponses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by\n\ncommunity members. Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate\n\ntranslational experiences. Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and\n\naccountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the\n\ncurrent response continuum. OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation,",

Instructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation(s) and provide the student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in person meeting or by phone or videoconference as circumstances warrant. 3. Course instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, faculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation(s) under review. For example, someone may have observed the suspected incident or interacted directly with the involved student(s) before, during, or after the incident in question. 4. When discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors should avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in order to determine responsibility. 5. If a student does not respond to notification of an alleged violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity, the matter may be reviewed in their absence by the course instructor after a reasonable period of time. In these circumstances, the course instructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome. Determining Responsibility and Course-Level Action 1. The course instructor will decide whether the suspected violation(s) occurred based on available evidence. At this stage, instructors are encouraged to consult with the department\u2019s designated Academic Integrity Liaison, department/program head, the college dean\u2019s office or the Office of Community Standards and Integrity regarding the nature of the suspected violation(s), the nature of the evidence related to the alleged violation(s), and the range of outcomes under consideration. 2. When assessing responsibility for an academic integrity violation, the course instructor should apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the evidence means that the course instructor has determined that it is more likely than not that the student has violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity. 3."

      "Through the tireless work of our frontline workers, public safety liaisons, and subject matter experts we aim to address the needs of those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness or housing instability, substance use disorder, and mental or behavioral health challenges. It is our goal that our most vulnerable residents can be embraced by their neighbors and welcomed back in their communities. The Office of Community Health & Safety has piloted novel yet best-practice driven programs such as Co-Response, Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, Trauma Survivor\u2019s Assistance, People In Need of Support, Post Overdose Support Team, and Reaching Out On The Streets. From helping family survivors of suicide and gun violence to those experiencing homelessness, each of these programs focuses on centering individual needs and reducing harm. The Office of Community Health and Safety was announced in 2020, and since then we have sought not only to support community members who need assistance but do so in a financially responsible manner. We have successfully applied for numerous state and federal grants, funding our Post Overdose Support Team and Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program through federal funding mechanisms. Our partners in the Pittsburgh Bureaus of Police, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services are also indispensable as we connect community members who utilize 911 with longer term support. Central to our mission is to listen to the voices of all our community members and ensure that our programs serve those in need, especially those who have experienced historical and structural inequities and discrimination. Our programs are all voluntary, person centered, trauma informed and built on the principles of harm reduction. We are a team of Community Social Workers, Police Officers, Firefighters, Paramedics, EMTs, programming staff, and most of all \u2013 all passionate Pittsburgh residents working towards common goals. Though the challenges we face are formidable, with the partnership of communities throughout the City of Pittsburgh we are confident we can truly make Pittsburgh a safer, healthier, and more equitable city.

      "PITTSBURGH, PA (April 9, 2020) - The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has received confirmation that three additional personnel have tested positive for COVID-19. An instructor with the Police Academy, an officer working in the administrative branch, and a Police recruit have received positive test results. All three are in self-isolation at home. Police officials are in the process of identifying and notifying anyone\u00a0who may have had contact with these individuals and placing them in self-quarantine. There are now four positive COVID-19 cases within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. No one has required hospitalization at this point. Police are in regular contact with all four individuals and are closely monitoring their health and well-being. In addition, two City of Pittsburgh Environmental Services employees have also tested positive for the virus. Other Environmental Services employees who may have been in contact with the two are in self-quarantine as a precaution. For privacy reasons, the names of the individuals impacted by the virus are not being released. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 15, 2019) \u2013 Four members of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services were promoted to chiefs Monday afternoon in Council Chambers during a promotions ceremony. EMS Chief Ron Romano, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, and Mayor William Peduto congratulated the chiefs on their new positions and thanked them for their dedicated service to the city. The new chiefs are: District Chief Justin Sypolt, Division Chief Richard Linn, Assistant Chief Mark Pinchalk\u00a0and Deputy Chief Amera Gilchrist. Five Paramedics who finished their probation periods also were sworn in to their new positions. The new paramedics are: Sean Chellar, David Czurko,\u00a0Jocelyn Hetrick, Joshua Lane and Nicholas Lawrence. Deputy Chief Gilchrist is the first female and the first minority to be EMS Deputy Chief. \u201cToday a glass ceiling has been broken and it is my hope that the city\u2019s dedication to diversity and inclusiveness in Public Safety gives women and minorities the courage to know that we are supported,\u201d Gilchrist said. \u201cI am proud to live and work in the city of Pittsburgh. I am proud to work alongside all of you. I am proud that, because of my parents, the word \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 has never been in my DNA. I pray that my children see the limitless future that awaits them and they too will believe \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 is not in their DNA.\u201d\n\n(Deputy Chief Amera Gilchrist)",
      "Police Command Staff is in daily contact with the officers and their families. No one from EMS, Animal Care & Control or Emergency Management has tested positive for the virus. \u201cOther departments have seen 10, 15, even 20 percent of their personnel become ill, but we have so far avoided anything like that,\u201d Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. \u201cThis virus is volatile and dangerous, but we have implemented numerous measures that we hope will continue to keep our numbers as low as possible.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Public Safety personnel have been issued masks to be worn at all times while in public. First Responders\u2019 are screened before entering facilities and anyone with a fever or any other symptom is sent home. In addition, social distancing is being observed at all times possible. One Environmental Services worker sadly died of COVID-19 this week. A second employee who tested positive has not yet returned to work. Note: The numbers of personnel being tested, self-isolations, self-quarantines and other COVID-19-related actions fluctuate daily, and as such Public Safety and the City will provide weekly updates on positive tests but cannot accommodate daily inquiries. PITTSBURGH, PA (May 19, 2020) -- During National Emergency Medical Services Week, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS received recogntion today from the Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council\u00a0for its ongoing\u00a0commitment to\u00a0delivering high-quality\u00a0pediatric\u00a0emergency care in the City of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS completed Pennsylvania's Pediatric Voluntary Recognition Program (PVRP)\u00a0to ensure that all children receive the best possible prehospital emergency care. The multi-faceted program requires EMS agencies to complete five requirements\u00a0that build from the basic to the expert level. The Council's\u00a0EMS for Children Program Manager, Duane Spencer, recognized the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS for its successful completion of the expert level. EMS Chief Ron Romano received the offical certification on behalf of the Bureau, calling it a great honor. \"Many thanks to the paramedics who are out there doing this every day and making this accomplishment happen and for making us all proud,\" said Romano. EMS District Chief Jeffrey Meyer was also recognized as\u00a0the program's Pediatric Emergency Care Coordinator\u00a0who will assist the Bureau in preparing for calls for service involving pediatric patients through ongoing education and training, quality improvement,\u00a0community engagement and preparedness, and clinical care. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich acknowledged the evolution of Pittsburgh EMS over the years, as it\u00a0improves on skills with thousands of hours of advanced\u00a0training to include things like pediatric care. Hissrich said,\u00a0\"I think it's very important that we've expanded our role not only from the response by EMS, but to prevention, and hopefully that will continue.\"",

    "question": "When should students anticipate the demands of the exam schedule?",
    "context": [
      "There should be no expectation that the following points will cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the exam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course syllabus. In order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this document lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. Instructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the course syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the responsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with the instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed. Definitions \u2022 Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). \u2022 Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by the University Registrar's Office. \u2022 Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self-scheduled examinations. \u2022 Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. \u2022 In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as in-term examinations. 43",
      "Final Examinations 1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self- scheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. 2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day of classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned. 44\n\n3. No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final examination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final examination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no classes other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. Review sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort should be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio reviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a final examination. 4. Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examinations. 5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 25-hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled within a 25-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should first contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the problem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate dean of his or her home college.",
      "Policies I. In-term Examinations 1. All in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. However, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may be administered outside of regularly scheduled class time. 2. No examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled examinations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time Saturday or Sunday. 3. The instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls outside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an alternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, including those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that the instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner). 4. No student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class examinations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor in a timely manner of his/her circumstance so that appropriate accommodations can be made.",
      "The Winter Break period is not included. Meal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed based upon actual use. There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee. Financial Aid Adjustment Federal and institutional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student earns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is completed. Student grants and non-federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the withdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds. Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy Policy Statement No undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure This policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co- curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students. In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. 113\n\nAs with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions. Any academic or artistic activities which you feel must be scheduled between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m.",
      "42\n\nExaminations for Undergraduate Courses Policy Preamble The Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of examinations for the undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). These policies represent an understanding between faculty and student concerning an important but often stressful period, especially at the conclusion of each academic semester and at mid-semester."

    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture",
      "ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh. Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881. While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced. The union of the two men cemented their dominance over the Pittsburgh steel industry, and led to the eventual formation of United States Steel. In 1892, a labor dispute between Homestead Steel\u2014the nation\u2019s largest producer of steel, owned by Frick and Carnegie\u2014and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers\u2014its largest craft union\u2014escalated into a major, violent event. That summer, with Carnegie out of the country and the dispute still unresolved, Frick closed the mill, locking out 3,800 workers and intending to replace them with non-union employees. The union workers then seized the mill. Frick, in return, arranged for 300 armed Pinkerton detectives to travel by boat down the Ohio River, enter the mill on the river side and reclaim the building. Almost as soon as the detectives arrived, fighting began between both sides, resulting in loss of life for both steelworkers and Pinkerton detectives. It lasted for 12 hours, and eventually the Pennsylvania National Guard was ordered by the governor to intercede. The mill was secured and Homestead was placed under martial law. Henry Clay Frick showed an early interest in collecting paintings and drawings. In 1871, he applied for a loan of $10,000 from the bank of T. Mellon & Sons. The agent from the bank who was sent to investigate Frick\u2019s reliability commented that Frick \u201cmay be a little too enthusiastic about pictures, but not enough to hurt.\u201d By 1881 Frick had the resources to begin forming an art collection. His first recorded purchase of a painting was in February of that year. Frick chose a wooded landscape by local artist George Hetzel, who was a member of the Scalp Level School\u2014a group of regional painters who traveled to the countryside to sketch and paint in the manner of the French Barbizon School. Not long after that, Frick purchased other works, including At the Louvre (Une R\u00e9v\u00e9lation) by Spanish artist Luis Jim\u00e9nez y Aranda, a humorous, anecdotal painting of a young woman and her chaperone confronting a classical statue in the Louvre. Around 1885, after the Frick family was well-settled in Clayton, Frick began collecting in earnest. Much of this early purchasing focuses on French landscape painters of the Barbizon School, including Dessous de Bois (The Forest Floor) by Th\u00e9odore",
      "The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45]\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\u00a0million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[48]\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development."

      "Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/ PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259 (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20]\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of France 1690s\u20131763 \u00a0Great Britain 1681\u20131781 \u00a0United States 1776\u2013present\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]:\u200a289\n\n18th century\n\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28]",
      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]\n\nBy 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]\n\nIn 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29\u00a0km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]\n\nShannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders.

All programs must register with Child Protection Operations, within the Office of Human Resources, and receive approval prior to engaging in any interactions with minors. Child Protection Operations will coordinate with each program or activity to develop appropriate procedures and training to ensure the welfare and security of minors who participate in the program. 2. The review process conducted by Child Protection Operations will be based on the unique circumstances of each program and include consideration of the following key factors, among others: the nature of the program; the duration of the program; the entity sponsoring the program; the responsible individual(s); the number of participants and age ranges; the number of supervising adults; the facilities to be used; use of overnight accommodations; potential health and safety concerns (e.g., laboratory use, machinery, swimming pools, motor vehicles); transportation; protocols for accidents, injuries and emergencies; health and wellness plans; protocols for drop\n\noff and pick\n\nup; and one\n\non\n\none private interactions with minors. 3.

All members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers, are expected to act in accordance with this policy. This policy describes three separate and independent requirements: \u2022 First, in Section II, it describes a \u201cProgram Registration\u201d requirement which will allow the university to ensure that programs involving minors satisfy the requirements of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, as well as other best practices related to health, safety, program operation, parental permission, risk management, etc. \u2022 Second, in Section III, the Policy sets forth the requirements for background certifications that are required by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law when working with minors. These requirements are independent of the program registration requirements in Section II. Before working with minors, please make sure of your obligations under both Sections II and III. \u2022 Third, in Section IV, the Policy sets forth the requirements for the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. I. Definitions \u2022 The terms \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cminor child\u201d are defined as any individual less than eighteen (18) years of age.* \u2022 \u201cMatriculated Student\u201d is defined as a student who is enrolled at Carnegie Mellon and pursuing a program of study that results in a postsecondary credential, such as a certificate, diploma or degree.* \u2022 \u201cSchool Employee\u201d is defined as an individual who is employed by Carnegie Mellon or who provides a program, activity or service sponsored by Carnegie Mellon.

Depending on the nature of the program or activity involving minors, the responsible individual may be a faculty member, staff member, student, contractor, volunteer or a third-party. 205\n\nFor purpose of Section II of this Policy, \"Programs and Activities Involving Minors\" is defined as any program, event, or activity involving one or more individuals under the age of 18 that is either: o Sponsored, funded and/or operated by any Carnegie Mellon administrative unit, academic unit, or student organization, regardless of location. This includes programs and activities conducted on\n\ncampus, off\n\ncampus, or remotely via the internet or other means of communication; or o Sponsored, funded and/or operated by a third\n\nparty entity and conducted on university property.

Rather, exclusion from this definition exempts the activity from the registration requirements in Section II. These definitions are based on the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. 21 Unpaid internships (where permitted by applicable government regulations and HR guidelines) are not exempt from the definition of Programs & Activities Involving Minors. 206\n\nHuman subjects research studies involving minor children that have been approved by the Institutional Review Board (note: the Office of Research Integrity Compliance will notify Child Protection Operations of any human subjects research studies involving minors so that there will be no need to separately register).

Thank you. \u201cWe also want to thank Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland and Sgt. Joe Lewis, who was Officer Hall\u2019s supervisor at Northview Heights, for your care and compassion. We will never forget all that you have done. \u201cWe want to thank everyone at the Northview Heights Public Safety Center. Officer Hall was so proud to be a part of a unit that was truly making a difference in the community. He spoke of his fellow officers and the substation often. We will not forget you. \u201cTo Officer Hall\u2019s partner, Officer Reggie Eiland, there are no words that can adequately describe how grateful we are for the love, dedication and loyalty that you showed your fellow officer. You never left his side. You were there day and night, as were as so many other officers. We thank you, Officer Reggie, we thank you, Officer Joe Bucci, and we thank every other officer who showed their support, including the Chief of Police in Braddock, where Officer Hall worked before he came to Pittsburgh, who was there to support him and to offer his prayers. \u201cThere are so many others we want to thank, including those whose names we never learned. If we have forgotten anyone, please forgive us. But know that your kindness and devotion did not go unrecognized. We thank you all for working around the clock to support officer Hall and his family.\u201d\n\nThe family will make themselves available for media statements in the near future.

      "Regarding the investigation, Police can confirm that there was a party or parties on the 7300 block of Monticello Street Saturday night and into Sunday morning. Attendees were both inside and outside homes on the street. At some point, there was an argument or disagreement in the street. Around 1:30 a.m., shots were fired and one person was struck multiple times. The victim was brought to a local hospital in critical condition. Detectives continue to follow leads and interview residents and potential witnesses. As we have stressed in the past: Investigations are greatly aided when people with information come forward and share it with police. If anyone has information on this shooting, please call Police at (412) 323-7800. Regarding the victim, Police can confirm that the shooting victim is Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall. Officer Hall is a 2-year veteran of the Bureau, assigned to the Northview Heights Public Safety Center. He previously worked for Braddock Police. Officer Hall was hand-picked to work in the Northview Heights Public Safety Center because of his career-long dedication to community outreach. Sgt. Joseph Lewis, who heads the Northview Heights Public Safety Center, said he recruited Officer Hall because of his positive attitude and ability to relate to all people from all walks of life. \u201cHe was born and raised in the City of Pittsburgh and his ways of connecting to the community and to other officers was extremely beneficial for what we\u2019re trying to do in Northview Heights,\u201d Sgt. Lewis said. \u201cHe is always positive, always upbeat.

Officer Hall, 36, remains in critical condition. We ask that the media and public respect his family\u2019s privacy while Officer Hall fights for his life. The family has asked that the media not contact them at this time. While the Bureau is deeply affected by Officer Hall\u2019s shooting, it is important to note that the overnight hours of July 13-14 resulted in multiple other victims of senseless gun violence, none of whom should be overlooked or forgotten. In addition to the Monticello Street shooting, one person was shot and critically injured during a music concert at Nova Place, and two people were shot in Northview Heights, leaving one victim in critical condition. Police are actively investigating those shootings as well. Our primary directive as a Bureau is to eliminate violent crime.",
      "He made it a priority to connect with residents, and succeeded in doing so. \u201cOfficer Hall was shot three times in the back July 14 on the 7300 block of Monticello Street. He fought valiantly for more than three days before succumbing to his injuries. \u201cRegarding the investigation, we are investigating Officer Hall\u2019s death as a homicide, and we are investigating the strong possibility, based on gathered evidence, that Officer Hall, who was off duty, was in fact acting under the color of the law when he was fatally shot. \u201cThat will be determined investigatively at a later date. Ceremonially, Officer Hall will receive the full burial honors that he deserves. \u201cWe all want answers.",

    "question": "Who founded Carnegie Mellon University?",
    "context": [
      "Total enrollment is about 7,700. In 1900 the industrialist Andrew Carnegie gave a gift of $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh for the creation of a technical school. Originally called Carnegie Technical Schools, it was renamed Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912. The institute merged with the Mellon Institute (established in 1913 in Pittsburgh by financier Andrew W. Mellon) in 1967. The university has built a reputation as a vital arts centre, operating three art galleries, two concert halls, and two theatres. The faculty has included Nobel Prize-winning economists Herbert Alexander Simon and Merton Miller. University of Pittsburgh, coeducational state system of higher learning in Pennsylvania, U.S., comprising a main campus in Pittsburgh and branches in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville. The Pittsburgh campus is a comprehensive research institution of higher learning and includes 16 schools that offer more than 360 degree programs. Among these schools are those of Medicine, Dental Medicine, Law, Engineering, and Social Work.",
      "9\n\nEducational Goals Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Academic and Individual Freedom Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 10",

PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 13, 2021) -- Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street last night, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the\u00a0demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via\u00a0the 10th\u00a0Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being. Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information\u00a0to the public as it becomes available.

As such, the Pittsburgh Emergency Management Agency expanded its mission area to include Homeland Security and altered the name of the organization to the Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEMHS). The post 9/11 era also brought new federal preparedness and response funding for state and local agencies through the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP). Through this program, Pittsburgh OEMHS was able to purchase various vehicles and equipment to fill response gaps created from the newly evolving threat landscape. These pieces of equipment and vehicles helped enhance operational abilities and address capability gaps within the City and Region. Pittsburgh was a pioneer in many pieces of equipment including the creation of the state of the art Pierce/LDV Mobile Command Post equipped with the latest technology to function as a free standing 911 center.

Conduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs the class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard to tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the responsibility of the individual instructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if major action, such as dropping the student from the course, is being considered. All classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all holidays and recesses. Both faculty and students are expected to be present. Members of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from classes to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of town, provided the following conditions are met: \u2022 All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; \u2022 No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are not scheduled; \u2022 The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization annually; \u2022 Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student affairs staff member. Technology affords many students access to portable devices including cell phones, PDAs, and laptops. It is expected that students will respect the wishes of faculty with regard to the use of electronic devices within the academic environment. Students who, because of religious beliefs, cannot attend class may arrange as individuals to be absent, provided the work missed is made up in a manner satisfactory to the instructor(s) of the class(es) missed. No student shall leave a scheduled exercise because of the absence of the instructor until a reasonable time has passed.

      "262 Workplace Threats and Violence Policy ........................................................................................ 263\n\n135\n\nActivities Extracurricular activities involving the students at Carnegie Mellon are under the direction of Student Government, the Division of Student Affairs, or particular university departments, committees and councils advisory to the officers of the university. In general, students are charged with exercising a high level of self-governance related to extracurricular activities and, toward that end, are encouraged to form organizations that serve their extracurricular needs and qualify for recognition and/or funding by Student Government. Financial statements of all organizations or committees that collect money, in any manner, from the student body must be available to Student Government if requested. Publication in The Tartan of a statement of the accounts may be required at the option of Student Government. Eligibility Extracurricular activities are any campus social, cultural, service or honorary organization; varsity, club or intramural athletic team; or any other campus organization recognized by Student Government or by the university whether participation is on the intercollegiate level or within the university. Students who meet the criteria outlined in the Student Activities Fee policy will be assessed the Student Activities Fee by Enrollment Services, and will be eligible to participate in extracurricular activities upon paying the fee. Enrolled students who seek to participate in extracurricular activities but who are not automatically assessed the Student Activities Fee must pay the relevant semester(s) fee prior to participation. Active Medical Assistance Protocol (AMAP) The university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an environment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another.

Pittsburgh Public Safety received equipment for its Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), including 150 CERT kits, 150 safety vests, 150 disaster preparedness starter kits and 20 personal bleeding control kits valued at $18,922. \"Community Emergency Response Teams assist as an integral part of a larger system that promotes safer, stronger neighborhoods and communities,\u201d said\u00a0Barbara M. Morello, Supervisor/CERT Instructor with Pittsburgh\u2019s Public Safety Department. \u201cThe CERT program\u00a0helps to train individuals in the local community to be better prepared to respond to an emergency situation in their home, school, or workplace. By placing the focus on an all-hazards approach of preparedness planning efforts on capacities and capabilities in Public Safety, increasing awareness to reach a whole community approach ultimately mitigates\u00a0the consequences of a disaster.\"\n\nAlso receiving grants were: Moon Volunteer Fire Department, which received equipment for its rescue truck valued at $12,803; North Fayette Township Volunteer Fire Department, which received a gear washer valued at $11,519; and West Deer Volunteer Fire Company #2, which received a brush skid unit valued at $11,090. \u201cWe want to thank our\u00a0donors who help us provide these lifesaving tools,\u201d said Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation Executive Director Robin Peters. \u201cOur first responders are our heroes and we want to be sure they have the tools and technology they need to protect their communities.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich attended the grant ceremony today at the Firehouse Subs in Robinson Town Centre with Morello, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert and Assistant Public Safety Director\u00a0Shatara Murphy. Hissrich noted that the grant allows Public Safety to allocate $18,922 to other pressing needs, and called the grant \u201cincredibly valuable and important.\u201d\n\nFirehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was created in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Firehouse Subs founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen, travelled to Mississippi to provide food to first responders and hurricane survivors. Certain they could do more, they started Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation with the mission of providing funding, lifesaving equipment and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety departments. The non-profit has granted more than $35 million to organizations in 47 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, including $581,000 in Pennsylvania, since its inception.

      "The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City\u2019s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate,\n\nand foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through\n\ncloseout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City\u2019s exposure to any grant-related legal liability,\n\nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars. The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to\n\nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City\u2019s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant\n\nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our\n\ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain\n\ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed\n\nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services,\n\nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows\n\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the\n\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant. In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects\n\nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding\n\nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield\n\nBridge supported by a State grant award..

      "sports, but it was the Buenos Aires Football Club, founded June 20, 1867, that kindled Argentine passions. In almost every instance, the first to adopt football were the cosmopolitan sons of local elites, many of whom had been sent to British schools by their Anglophile parents. Seeking status as well as diversion, middle-class employees of British firms followed the upper-class lead. From the gamut of games played by the upper and middle classes, the industrial workers of Europe and Latin America, like the indigenous population of Africa, appropriated football as their own. By the late 19th century, the United States had begun to rival Great Britain as an industrial power and as an inventor of modern sports. Enthusiasts of baseball denied its origins in British children\u2019s games such as cat and rounders and concocted the myth of Abner Doubleday, who allegedly invented the game in 1839 in Cooperstown, New York. A more plausible date for the transformation of cat and rounders into baseball is 1845, when a New York bank clerk named Alexander Cartwright formulated the rules of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club. Even before the Civil War, the game had been taken over by urban workers such as the volunteer firemen who organized the New York Mutuals in 1857. By the time the National League was created in 1876, the game had spread from coast to coast. (It was not until the 1950s, however, that Major League Baseball planted its first franchises on the West Coast.)",

      "National organizations developed to standardize rules and regulations, to transform sporadic challenge matches into systematic league competition, to certify eligibility, and to register results. Rowing (crew), one of the first sports to assume its modern form, began to attract a following after the first boat race between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (1829) and the inauguration of the Henley Regatta (1839). \u201cAthletics\u201d became popular after Oxford and Cambridge held their first track-and-field meet in 1864. The Amateur Athletic Association, which emphasized track-and-field sports, was founded in 1880, the Amateur Rowing Association in 1882. Neither sport enjoyed the popularity of association football. The various versions of football played at elite schools such as Eton, Winchester, and Charterhouse were codified in the 1840s, and England\u2019s Football Association was formed in 1863 to propagate what came to be known as \u201cassociation football\u201d (or simply \u201csoccer\u201d). The Rugby Football Union followed in 1871. Although the Football Association and most of its affiliated clubs were initially dominated by the middle and upper classes, soccer had definitely become \u201cthe people\u2019s game\u201d by the end of the century. For instance, Manchester United, one of Britain\u2019s most storied teams, can trace its history to a club established by the city\u2019s railroad workers in 1880. The entry of working-class athletes into soccer and other sports, as participants if not as administrators, inspired Britain\u2019s middle and upper classes to formulate the amateur rule, which originally excluded not only anyone paid for athletic performances but also anyone who earned his living by manual labour of any sort. From the British Isles, modern sports (and the amateur rule) were diffused throughout the world. Sports that originally began elsewhere, such as tennis (which comes from Renaissance France), were modernized and exported as if they too were raw materials imported for British industry to transform and then export as finished goods. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the British expelled the French from Canada and from India and extended British rule over much of Africa. To the ends of the earth, cricket followed the Union Jack, which explains the game\u2019s current popularity in Australia, South Asia, and the West Indies. Rugby football flourishes in other postcolonial cultures, such as New Zealand and South Africa, where the British once ruled. It was, however, association football\u2019s destiny to become the world\u2019s most widely played modern sport. Cricket and rugby seemed to require British rule in order to take root. Football needed only the presence of British economic and cultural influence. In Buenos Aires, for instance, British residents founded clubs for cricket and a dozen other sports, but it was the Buenos Aires Football Club, founded June 20, 1867, that kindled Argentine passions. In almost every instance, the first to adopt football were the cosmopolitan sons of local",

Continue to represent the department and yourselves with the highest level of professionalism and dedication possible,\u201d said Romano. Medical Director Dr. Ron Roth congratulated all of the paramedics on their accomplishments, while pointing out that for the EMTs, working to advance their careers while already holding down demanding EMS jobs, is no small feat. \u201cThat was an incredible task. To become a paramedic is not easy in itself, but to do it while working is just incredible and that really shows your dedication to the service,\u201d said Dr. Roth. As a key focus of Mayor Ed Gainey\u2019s administration, Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt stressed the importance of ensuring that all Public Safety employees, such as those in the Bureau of EMS, are well-supported as they experience\u00a0what can\u00a0often be stress-filled and emotionally-challenging work days. Said Schmidt, \u201cMake sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself. We see people at the best moments, we can see people we serve people in their worst moments, and those things can be taken home, but we need to make sure we process those things. We have to make sure you\u2019re keeping yourself physically fit, as well as mentally fit.\u201d\n\nBefore administering the oath of office and swearing in the new paramedics, Mayor Gainey\u2019s Chief Operating and Administrative Officer Lisa Frank reiterated the Mayor\u2019s vision for the City of Pittsburgh\u00a0as one that is anchored in the well-being and safety of its residents. \u201cParamedics have a special place in the work that we do and in the work that the administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d said Frank.

      "When more information is avauilable, this press release will be updated. (Pittsburgh, Pa.) April 23 2018 --\u00a0Every summer for more than a decade, The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police hosts children ages 8 to 12 at the annual Cops and Kids Summer Camp --\u00a0and time is running out to sign up! The week-long camps, which are held at Allegheny County Community College, Duquesne University, University of Pittsburgh, and Chatham University, are designed to give kids hands-on interactions with police specialty units and other city and county public safety departments, including medic and fire departments, and the 911 mobile training unit. Campers have an opportunity to explore up close and study our SWAT vehicle, robotic performance, and participate in a mock crime scene. \"With the right opportunities, summer can be a time of great opportunity and growth for city youth,\u201d Mayor Bill Peduto said. \u201cThat's why I love the Cops and Kids camp. It matches police who want to give back to the community with young people who are hungry to learn about a life in public service.\"\n\nMaster Police Officer Mildred Jenkins works at the camps and said the program \u201chighlights issues that, unfortunately, plague our communities with discussions regarding bullying, illegal drugs, violent gangs, and firearm safety. We also place an emphasis on understanding the importance of being a good citizen and the significance of obtaining an education.\u2019\n\nFifty city youths are invited to attend each session. Session 1: July 9-13 at Duquesne University.",
      "Mayor William Peduto applauded the move, which is the latest in the Bureau\u2019s efforts to improve community relations. \"The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has made great strides in community outreach and openness the last five years, from sharing crime data to joining the National Initiative and this latest move to share its internal policies with the public,\u201d Mayor Peduto said. \u201cI want to thank the leadership of the bureau and every last member of the force for their dedication to both protecting and opening dialogue with the greater Pittsburgh community.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh Police Cops and Kids Summer Camp 2019\n\n(PITTSBURGH, PA) April 24, 2019 \u2013 This fall, go back to school with the best \u201cWhat I did last summer\u201d story of them all.

The program gives young people the chance to not only interact with police, but interact with them in a positive, fun learning environment. Cops and Kids could be more than a fun summer camp. It could show kids that a career in public safety is their calling, like it did for me.\u201d\n\nEach daily session runs from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Two meals, snacks, uniforms, and transportation to and from the campsite is provided.

      "Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, The Pennsylvania Army National\n\nGuard or the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. 6-\n\nEXAMPLES FOR LOCAL SERVICE TAX (LST)\n\n1. How is the LST deducted from the employee\u2019s pay and remitted to the City? Example,\n\nemployees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more. What is\n\nthe employer\u2019s responsibility? ANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro-rata share of the tax by dividing\n\n$52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. The $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per\n\nmonth for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculating the pro-rata share, employers are\n\nrequired to round down to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. The employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The\n\ntax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The LST forms can be\n\ndownloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\n\n2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City\n\nfor the entire calendar year. Should the employer withhold the LST? ANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that\n\nhe will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to\n\nwithhold the LST. The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available\n\nfor employees to complete. The exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\n\n3. A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his\n\nemployee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is\n\nworking more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsible for\n\nwithholding the LST now? ANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or\n\nmore, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch-up then\n\n$1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of $52. 4. Employee has two part-time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year\n\nand another in Municipality \u201cA\u201d that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to\n\npay the LST? ANSWER: No. The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate with both employers\n\nand have no LST deducted. The Taxpayer is not subject to the LST since he did not earn\n\n$12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a\n\nrefund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund\n\nrequest form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance - the form is\n\nlisted as LST REFUND FORM. 5.",

      "Professional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937\u201345 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947\u201348 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961\u201363), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970\u201372), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004\u201308) and Phantoms (2009\u201310) both of the ABA. Three Pittsburgh universities, the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and Robert Morris University, compete in NCAA Division I basketball. Pitt and Duquesne are the traditional basketball powers in the city, but all three universities have made multiple appearances in the National Invitation Tournament and NCAA tournament. Pitt won two pre-NCAA tournament National Championships in 1928 and 1930[215] while Duquesne won the NIT title in 1955, its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Both Pitt and Duquesne have reached the NCAA tournament Final Four once, Duquesne in 1940 and Pitt in 1941. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. Soccer\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Riverhounds play their home games at Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[citation needed]\n\nGolf\n\nGolf has deep roots in the area.

Of these, Pitt is the only school that is a member of the so-called \" Power Five \" conferences that are primary partners in the College Football Playoff structure (the Atlantic Coast Conference ). Other universities in Pittsburgh that field athletic teams include Carnegie Mellon University ( Division III ), Chatham University (Division III), Point Park University ( NAIA ), and Carlow University (NAIA). Football [ edit ] College football in Pittsburgh dates back to the University of Pittsburgh which first organized a football team in 1889 and played its first sanctioned game in 1890. In the first half of the 20th century, Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie Tech (now called Carnegie Mellon) all fielded football squads that made \"major\" bowl game appearances from the 1920s through the 1930s. These appearances included Duquesne in the 1933 and 1936 Orange Bowl , Carnegie Tech in the 1938 Sugar Bowl , and the University of Pittsburgh appearing in four Rose Bowls (1927, 1929, 1932, 1936) as well as nearby Washington and Jefferson College in the 1922 Rose Bowl . [ 56 ] In particular, Pitt was a national power during this era, claiming 8 national championships under the guidance of coaching legends such as Pop Warner and Jock Sutherland . More recently, the Panthers won another National Championship in 1976 and competed for several more through the 1980s. Multiple inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame played at Pitt, including Dan Marino , Tony Dorsett , Mike Ditka , and Larry Fitzgerald . [ 57 ] Pitt is the only university in Western Pennsylvania to still play college football at the highest level, the Football Bowl Subdivision , while Duquesne and Robert Morris have football teams that compete in the Football Championship Subdivision , and Carnegie Mellon fields a Division III football team.

    "question": "When was the Longtime Owner Occupant Tax Exemption Program (LOOP) proposed in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Published on March 07, 2025\n\nMayor Ed Gainey submits legislation to Council creating Groundbreaking Longtime Owner Occupant Tax Exemption Program (LOOP)\n\nPittsburgh, PA \u2013 Mayor Ed Gainey announced that he has submitted legislation to City Council creating a Longtime Owner Occupant Tax Exemption Program (LOOP) , a transformative initiative designed to shield Pittsburgh residents from rising property taxes caused by soaring housing prices in their communities. This groundbreaking program would provide significant relief to long-term homeowners in neighborhoods experiencing rapid property value increases, preventing the displacement of those who have invested in and nurtured their communities. If adopted by Council, the LOOP program would ensure that Pittsburgh residents who have contributed to the character and vibrancy of their neighborhoods will be able to continue living in the homes they\u2019ve cherished, despite the pressures of development on property values. \u201cI\u2019m proud to submit this legislation that will help keep people in the houses they made into homes,\u201d said Mayor Ed Gainey. \u201cNo resident should be forced out of their neighborhood due to development, and LOOP is an important step toward ensuring that Pittsburgh\u2019s residents can continue to call their communities home.\u201d\n\nThe LOOP program offers tax relief to homeowners in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods by exempting or deferring property tax increases for those who meet specific eligibility criteria. This includes homeowners who have lived in their property for at least ten continuous years, or five years if they\u2019ve received assistance from a government or nonprofit housing program. Additional eligibility factors include the increase in property assessment value, household income level, and the timeliness of tax payments. Key Eligibility Requirements for LOOP:",
      "Longtime Owner Occupant: Homeowners must have owned and lived in the same property for at least 10 years (or 5 years if they received housing assistance). Property Assessment Increase: Homeowners must experience an assessment value increase of more than 25% from one year to the next, or a 50% increase over a 5-year period. Income: Household income must be at or below 120% of the Area Median Income. Tax Payments: All real estate taxes must be current, or a payment plan must be in place with the Department of Finance. Pittsburgh\u2019s commitment to preserving affordable housing amidst growing gentrification pressures is stronger than ever. Mayor Gainey\u2019s leadership ensures that LOOP will be implemented efficiently and equitably. The application period for the program would run annually from January 1st to June 30th, with exemptions applied retroactively to the current tax year. Participants would then automatically receive the exemption each year until they sell their home or no longer meet eligibility requirements. Mayor Gainey Announced the submission of LOOP authorizing legislation as part of the Keep Pittsburgh Home campaign, a multi-pronged effort to address the root causes of Pittsburgh\u2019s housing affordability crisis by pursuing funding and legal reforms to increase funding for affordable housing development, change regulations to encourage more housing construction, and combat displacement caused by real estate speculation and gentrification. The event also highlighted the successes of other homeownership programs implemented or supported by the Gainey Administration, including OwnPGH , the Homeowner Assistance Program , and the Whole Home Repair Program . Through the OwnPGH program, the Gainey administration is breaking down historic barriers to homeownership. This program provides crucial down payment assistance for first-time buyers and has already helped 150 homeowners\u201488% of whom are women heads of household or from communities historically excluded from homeownership. OwnPGH is playing a critical role in closing Pittsburgh\u2019s racial and gender homeownership gaps, addressing disparities where Black Pittsburghers are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as white applicants, and women\u2014especially women of color\u2014face disproportionately higher financial and systemic barriers to homeownership. OwnPGH directly addresses these inequities, ensuring more families can own, stay, and build wealth in Pittsburgh. \u201cKeeping people in their homes isn\u2019t just about helping them buy; it\u2019s about ensuring they can afford to stay,\u201d said Mayor Gainey. \u201cToo many longtime homeowners are forced to sell, not because they want to leave, but because they cannot afford necessary repairs or rising costs in their own neighborhoods.\u201d",

      "As always, all emergencies should be immediately reported to 9-1-1. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2021) --\u00a0The recent surge in violent crime in the City of Pittsburgh is causing concern and even fear among some residents. Pittsburgh Police share that concern, especially as many of the victims of these crimes have been young people. So far this year, there have been 20 homicides in the City and close to 50\u00a0non-fatal shootings, marking 80% and 90% increases respectively from the same time last year. Pittsburgh is not alone in dealing with this, as the escalation of\u00a0violent crime is currently a national phenomenon. \"Although this uptick in violence appears to be a trend across the country, this is not our city. This is not Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will not allow this senseless loss of life to continue. Our officers will work directly with the community to get to the root cause of these crimes and stop them from occurring,\" Police Chief Scott Schubert said.",
      "Next year we hope to see the continued downward trend of these numbers. But that will only be done through the help of the community, technology and most importantly the work of Pittsburgh Police.\u201d\n\nThere were 71 homicides in 2014. The total dropped to 60 in 2015, 59 in 2016, 58 in 2017 and 55 in 2018. There were 174 non-fatal shootings in 2015, when Police began creating the\u00a0Group\u00a0Violence Intervention (GVI) Unit, which targets at-risk members of the community and offers guidance and services to escape a life of violence and crime. The number rose to 188 in 2016, then dropped to 140 in 2017 and 114 in 2018.",
      "Police will repeat the blitzes throughout the city in the coming weeks and months to clear as many\u00a0311\u00a0complaints as\u00a0possible.

Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, members of Police command staff, Gun Violence Intervention (GVI),\u00a0representatives from the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Community Outreach members, and families of gun violence\u00a0victims gathered at the Center for Victims on E. Carson Street. Year-to-date there have been 31 homicides, compared with 20 homicides\u00a0at the same time in 2020. There\u00a0have been 76 non-fatal shootings since January. \"I'm tired of going out to scenes and seeing families and communities grieving,\" said Director Hissrich. \"It's going to be a long fight and it's going to be a a very hard\u00a0summer for us, but I'm sure with the help of our communities and our partners, that we'll end what we're facing.\"\n\nPittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert made an impassioned plea for the violence to stop, referencing recent cases of homicides and non-fatal shootings involving young people, including\u00a0a teenager shot multiple times\u00a0and killed just steps from his family home, and a six-year-old girl shot and wounded in a car. \u201cThere's so many guns on the street. No community, no zone in the City of Pittsburgh is immune. We're losing our loved ones to the senseless violence,\" said Chief Schubert. \"This stuff has got to stop. We're going to use every partner we have to make sure that happens\u00a0and we're going to work as a team. But I implore you, we need the community to help us.",
      "And here you are.\u201d\n\nPITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 30, 2020) -- The City of Pittsburgh saw significant reductions in several key crime categories in 2019, most notably in homicides. Police officials credited the reductions to several factors, including excellent police work, a focus on community outreach and engagement, the lifesaving work of medics, firefighters and hospitals, partner law enforcement agencies, and the communities and residents we serve. \u201cSo many different things go into it,\u201d Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s hard work by our officers. Day in and day out, they amaze me with their work ethic, expertise and professionalism. And day in and day out, they make me proud to be their Chief. Others also deserve credit, including community members, our law enforcement partners at the local, state and federal levels, our amazing medics and hospitals and our community outreach efforts. \u201cBut while these numbers are encouraging, at the end of the day even one homicide is too many, one person being shot is too many,\u201d Chief Schubert said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll keep working. We won\u2019t be happy until the numbers are even lower.\u201d\n\nHomicides in the city dropped 36 percent year-on-year, from 58 in 2018 to 37 in 2019. The drop continues a downward trend over the past five years, and marks the fewest homicides in the city since 1998. In addition, the number of combined non-fatal shooting incidents plus homicides continued to trend downwards for a fourth year in a row:\n\n2016: 253 2017: 187 2018: 163 2019: 146\n\nAssistant Chief Lavonnie Bickerstaff noted that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police began its transition from reactive policing to evidence-based and intelligence-led policing in 2016. \"This style of policing relies heavily on the Focus Deterrents Model advocated by David Kennedy, who is well known for his work in Boston\u2019s 'Operation Ceasefire,'\" Bickerstaff said. \"This strategic response allows officers to identify and focus on the small groups of individuals who are actively engaged in violence and hold them accountable for their behavior instead of the entire community. When the police, community, and social services are working together and communicating the same message against violent crime, a true reduction in gun violence can be realized.\"\n\nThere were 1,569 violent crimes citywide, a drop of just 0.8 percent from 2018, but an 18.8 percent drop from the five-year average of 1,932 violent crimes per year. \"Good police work is helping to keep residents safe,\" Major Crimes Commander Victor Joseph said. \"From patrol officers who do excellent work on their beats to detectives who conduct thorough investigations, the men and women of this Bureau deserve credit. Their hard work and expertise is reflected in these numbers.\"",
      "Officers continued to investigate. On Saturday, June 29, Police applied for a warrant via summons for the adult actor, Thomas D\u2019Andrea, 46. The District Attorney\u2019s Office approved the charges. D\u2019Andrea is charged with simple assault and criminal mischief. Police are continuing to investigate.

      "The appeal officer will require that the dean of the student\u2019s college review the case and provide input on the final disposition. The appeal officer has the authority to accept, vacate or modify the decision as they deem appropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed. The appeal officer may reconvene the initial Academic Review Board or remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review. Outcomes The academic disciplinary action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions that may be imposed during second-level review. One or more of these actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be imposed as appropriate. Non-compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Review Board process. The determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of the community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Outcomes related to student standing These outcomes clarify the student's standing with the University. Additional violations of the Academic Integrity policy may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the University. \u2022 Disciplinary Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a designated period of time. Probation may entail specific requirements to be met. When a student is on disciplinary probation, they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in the event of further academic disciplinary action. \u2022 Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated period of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves from the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal.

The student has the right to recourse through the procedures outlined in The Word/Student Handbook against unreasonable academic action. Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy Policy Statement University Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three types of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate students: Academic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic regulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see university and college academic policies). Disciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the Office of Student Affairs (see The Word: Student Handbook). Administrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial obligations or failure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is imposed by Enrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures for financial obligations. Contact University Health Services for information about health regulations.) Suspended students may not: \u2022 register for courses \u2022 attend classes \u2022 live in student or fraternity/sorority housing \u2022 use campus facilities, including athletic facilities, library and computer clusters \u2022 participate in student activities \u2022 be members of student organizations \u2022 have student jobs (Note: students on academic suspension may have a summer campus job if they accepted the job before they were suspended.)\n\n97",
      "97\n\nEmployment Although suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic suspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non-student job with the university; students on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not. To have a non-student job, students on academic suspension must receive approval from their associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students) to ensure that the job will not violate their suspension terms. Students in violation of this will lose their degree student status, meaning they would have to reapply for admission to Carnegie Mellon through either Undergraduate Admission or the appropriate graduate department. Transfer Credit Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this. Appeals To appeal any action of this policy, the student may write to the following people: Academic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students); Disciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; Administrative Suspension - vice president for enrollment, vice president for business and planning, and the dean of student affairs, in consultation with the student's associate dean. Returning from Suspension In order to return from a suspension, a student must have the following approval: Academic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students); Disciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; Administrative Suspension - vice president for campus affairs or designate. 98",
      "13. In cases that involve appeals of course-level action, no information about the student's prior violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity will be shared with the Academic Review Board. If the student has prior violations on record and the course-level action is upheld on appeal, the student may be recalled before the board to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the Academic Review Board making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case. 127\n\nHearing Outcome Determination and Notifications 1. A representative of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity will be responsible for notifying the vice provost for education or designee in writing of the recommendation of the hearing group. 2. The vice provost for education or designee makes the decision in the case, informed by the recommendation of the Academic Review Board. The vice provost for education or designee may accept, reject or modify the recommendation, or may remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review. 3. After reviewing the recommendations and rendering a decision, the vice provost for education or designee will notify the student in writing of their decision. 4. The Office of Community Standards and Integrity will send a copy of the final decision letter to the following individuals: \u2022 Course instructor(s) \u2022 Head of the student's home department \u2022 Associate dean of the student's home college \u2022 Academic advisor for the student \u2022 Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student's department) \u2022 Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student's college) 5. Parents of a student will not be notified of any academic disciplinary action, except as permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 6. Academic disciplinary actions will be recorded in the student's disciplinary record in the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in accordance with student conduct records retention practices. When academic disciplinary actions affect eligibility for enrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Academic disciplinary records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the academic record of a student. 128",

General Grievances The following grievance procedures are to be used for graduate student problems or concerns that are not covered by any of the policies or procedures set forth above. As such, these grievance procedures may not be used as a substitute for procedures contemplated under any other policy, including but not limited to, policies regarding academic actions; academic disciplinary actions; community standards; harassment; sexual harassment; intellectual property; research misconduct or any other policy.

Students are strongly encouraged to seek informal resolution of grievances through consultations within the academic unit, department or program. Students may also seek assistance with the informal resolution of a grievance through the Vice Provost for Education. If a grievance cannot be resolved informally with the faculty or staff member involved within the academic department, a student may submit a formal, written grievance to the head of the department, unit or program.

      "PITTSBURGH, PA (August 24, 2018) \u2013 The City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Public Safety Department and three other western Pa. first responder organizations received grants today from Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation totalling $54,334. Pittsburgh Public Safety received equipment for its Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), including 150 CERT kits, 150 safety vests, 150 disaster preparedness starter kits and 20 personal bleeding control kits valued at $18,922. \"Community Emergency Response Teams assist as an integral part of a larger system that promotes safer, stronger neighborhoods and communities,\u201d said\u00a0Barbara M. Morello, Supervisor/CERT Instructor with Pittsburgh\u2019s Public Safety Department. \u201cThe CERT program\u00a0helps to train individuals in the local community to be better prepared to respond to an emergency situation in their home, school, or workplace. By placing the focus on an all-hazards approach of preparedness planning efforts on capacities and capabilities in Public Safety, increasing awareness to reach a whole community approach ultimately mitigates\u00a0the consequences of a disaster.\"\n\nAlso receiving grants were: Moon Volunteer Fire Department, which received equipment for its rescue truck valued at $12,803; North Fayette Township Volunteer Fire Department, which received a gear washer valued at $11,519; and West Deer Volunteer Fire Company #2, which received a brush skid unit valued at $11,090. \u201cWe want to thank our\u00a0donors who help us provide these lifesaving tools,\u201d said Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation Executive Director Robin Peters. \u201cOur first responders are our heroes and we want to be sure they have the tools and technology they need to protect their communities.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich attended the grant ceremony today at the Firehouse Subs in Robinson Town Centre with Morello, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert and Assistant Public Safety Director\u00a0Shatara Murphy. Hissrich noted that the grant allows Public Safety to allocate $18,922 to other pressing needs, and called the grant \u201cincredibly valuable and important.\u201d\n\nFirehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was created in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Firehouse Subs founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen, travelled to Mississippi to provide food to first responders and hurricane survivors. Certain they could do more, they started Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation with the mission of providing funding, lifesaving equipment and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety departments. The non-profit has granted more than $35 million to organizations in 47 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, including $581,000 in Pennsylvania, since its inception.

      "The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City\u2019s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate,\n\nand foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through\n\ncloseout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City\u2019s exposure to any grant-related legal liability,\n\nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars. The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to\n\nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City\u2019s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant\n\nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our\n\ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain\n\ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed\n\nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services,\n\nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows\n\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the\n\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant. In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects\n\nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding\n\nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield\n\nBridge supported by a State grant award..

      "The most common format used for CDAP meetings follows the below outline. City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals. After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines. In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting. In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance.

      "Be a source of reassurance and foster trust with your actions. It is in these moments that you can truly build a safer and more connected\u00a0community,\" said Scirotto. Public\u00a0Safety Director Lee Schmidt also encouraged the new officers to embrace the tenets of community policing as they continue their field training and embark on their careers in law enforcement. \"Our success as a department hinges on our ability to build strong, trusting relationships with the communities we serve. Take the time\u00a0to listen to the concerns of residents, engage with local leaders, and work collaboratively to address the root causes of crime and disorder. True public safety is a collective effort and you are the frontline ambassadors in that effort.\"",
      "Mayor William Peduto said the effort is part of the City\u2019s goal of helping all residents. \"Public Safety provides many services but at the department's heart is one main goal, and that is to be there for people in need of help. Having a coordinator in place whose sole job is providing assistance to victims is a major part of the City's efforts to give help to all, and especially those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Mayor Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he is proud of the work of the Victims Assistance Office, as it speaks to the City- and Department-wide desire to put others first. \u201cPublic Safety is a dynamic department that doesn\u2019t only include First Responders who save lives daily in times of urgency and emergency,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cIt also includes compassionate people who methodically consider the long-term needs of those who need help, and then take steps to provide it.\u201d\n\nAbboud, who started in her position on Aug. 3, 2020, said her goal is to help victims throughout the process, which often means multiple follow-up contacts. \u201cThey need somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to them and say, \u2018I\u2019m here for you.",
      "PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 3, 2018) --\u00a0The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in collaboration with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh and the Buhl Foundation\u2019s One Northside Initiative, invite residents and the media to the grand opening of the Northview Heights Public Safety Center at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 4. The new Public Safety Center -- which will serve residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings -- is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them. Tomorrow\u2019s Open House event will provide the public with a first glimpse inside the facility --\u00a0where residents will have access to job training, arts programs, and shared community space -- plus an opportunity to hear from City officials, community leaders\u00a0and Northview Heights residents on their hopes for the Safety Center. \u201cThis center is a great model of many different partners coming together for a common good, one that delivers equity and quality of life for all,\u201d Mayor William Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich credited the many partners who came together on this project, including the Housing Authority and Executive Director Caster D. Binion. \u201cWe worked closely on this important project, one which will result in improved police-community relations, more opportunities for residents and a safer environment for all,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cWe have seen great success with the opening of the Downtown substation, and we expect to replicate that success with the Northview Heights Public Safety Center.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u00a0fully understand\u00a0the value of working hand-in-hand with residents to build a better and safer community through collaboration, mutual respect and trust,\u201d Police Chief Scott Schubert added. \u201cThis partnership in Northview Heights has the ability to make a significant difference in community-police relations, reduction of\u00a0crime and disorder,\u00a0and shared success in overall community wellness. It's our goal to replicate these partnerships and\u00a0success stories in other communities.\u201d",
      "This Safety Center is in large part the result of the dedication and hard work of the Buhl Foundation, which decided several years ago to invest in Pittsburgh\u2019s Northside neighborhoods. Through a series of surveys, public meetings, and face-to-face meetings with residents, Buhl and their partners asked the public how they would change and improve their neighborhoods. In doing so, they identified several common themes, which became the pillars of their One Northside Initiative: Place, Employment, Health, Education, and Safety. \u201cBoth Northside residents and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers indicated a desire to build safer communities by working together,\u201d said Buhl Foundation President Diana Bucco. \u201cI congratulate the City of Pittsburgh Housing Authority, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the Mayor\u2019s Office for coming together in response to this need, and creating a space that is responsive to the community and a demonstration model that will truly have national implications.\u201d\n\nThe new Safety Center was made possible through a substantial investment of Housing Authority dollars to create the state-of-the-art facility to focus on resident engagement and pro-active community safety. \"The Public Safety Center is a welcome addition to the Northview Heights community,\" said HACP Executive Director Caster D. Binion. \"We are proud to partner with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, the Buhl Foundation and everyone who came together to develop a plan that puts resident safety and quality of life as the utmost priority.

    "context": [
      "9\n\nEducational Goals Carnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of higher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional education and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\" More specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all students will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, research and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the university contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, government and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Academic and Individual Freedom Within the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm commitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. 10",

In general, each member should: \u2022 Respect the rights of others; \u2022 Respect the property of individuals, groups and Carnegie Mellon; \u2022 Know, understand and abide by all Carnegie Mellon community standards, policies and regulations, as well as all local, state and federal laws; \u2022 Engage in behavior that does not interfere with individual, group or Carnegie Mellon regular activities and/or operation; \u2022 Ensure that guests behave in a manner consistent with and in accordance with the expectations of our community.

Mission To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being. To cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential. To impact society in a transformative way \u2014 regionally, nationally, and globally \u2014 by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus. 5\n\nCarnegie Mellon Code\n\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the University. 6\n\nAcademic Policies\n\n7"

In cases of alleged policy violations in which the responding party is a student organization, the following procedures will supplement the procedures outlined in the Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings: 1. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may violate university policy and the impacted party chooses not to serve as a complainant in a community standards proceeding, the university may act as a complainant when there exists a broader or overriding community interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to serve as complainant, they may nevertheless act as a witness in a University Disciplinary Committee hearing. 2. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may violate university policy, the university reserves the right to temporarily restrict any and all activities and operations of the organization while the case is being investigated and/or resolved through the appropriate process. 3. For purposes of organizational conduct, separation from the university may be defined as temporary or permanent loss of recognition along with associated privileges. 4.",
      "9. The university is committed to resolving cases related to organizational conduct in a timely manner. Complainants and respondents will receive periodic status updates related to the timeline for resolution of the case. 10. The university reserves the right to share periodic updates related to process, timeline, findings, and resolution of the case with appropriate parties including organization advisors, the sponsoring academic unit, (inter)national organization headquarters, and/or recognizing body (e.g. Student Government or appropriate Governing Councils), etc. 11. Unless a different timeline is set forth in this section, stated timelines for a University Disciplinary Committee hearing and notification of a decision will be followed in cases involving student organizations. 12. Upon a finding of responsibility, the University Disciplinary Committee or adjudicator will be provided with the student organization\u2019s prior community standards violations (four years prior) for consideration when determining outcomes. The student organization representatives may be recalled before the board to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary Committee making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case. The complainant may be recalled with the student organization representatives. 13. The University Disciplinary Committee may recommend as an outcome of the organizational review, that an individual or individuals be charged with specific policy violations to be reviewed via a subsequent community standards process. 14. In cases that involve student organizations, complaints will be considered for a period of four years following the date of the most recent allegation. Complaints received more than two years following the date of the most recent allegation may be reviewed upon the approval of the Associate Vice President for Community Standards and Diversity Initiatives. 15. In cases that involve student organizations, the complainant will receive notification of disposition of the allegation(s) to the degree that individual privacy is not impacted. 16. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs for community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter will typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor. 289\n\n17. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the respondent and complainant as necessary about the anticipated timeline. The complainant and respondent will be notified in writing of the final decision.",
      "2. When appropriate, an Administrative Resolution Meeting will take place with a university adjudicator. If the student respondent and the university adjudicator can resolve the matter, the student will be notified in writing of the determined action once said action is approved by the Resolution Review Board. 3. When the University Disciplinary Committee is assigned original jurisdiction or when Administrative Resolution has failed, the procedures outlined in the Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings will apply. A student who requires accommodations due to a disability in order to full participate in the community standards process should contact the Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability Resources which provides responsive and reasonable accommodations to students who self- identify as having a disability, including physical, sensory, cognitive and emotional disabilities. The university\u2019s policy on Student Accommodations is available at https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/policies-guidelines/. Additional information regarding the Office of Disability Resources, including how to request accommodations, is available at https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/. Community Standards Violations The following are groups of violations that constitute misconduct for which members of the student body may be held accountable. This list references policies that may be outlined in greater detail in this on-line handbook or other campus resources. The university is not limited by this list nor by other published policies when it initiates community standards actions since it is not possible to anticipate all of the behavior of a college population. Additionally, University departments and units may maintain specific policies or guidelines enforceable by their respective procedures separate from community standards action (e.g. University Libraries, Transportation Services, Environmental Health and Safety, Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX, etc.).",

Suppression and\n\nemergency medical services are the largest functional area in terms of responsibility and resources. The\n\nsuppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are\n\nto protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by\n\nbecoming a licensed emergency medical care provider issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The\n\nBureau provides these services through the following four divisions:\n\nAdministration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau. This activity includes budget\n\nand finance; payroll; employee relations, strategic planning; record and data gathering, facility and fleet\n\nmanagement. Operations - Provides emergency incident response to protect the lives and property of city residents and\n\nvisitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and\n\nemergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care\n\nto sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each\n\nyear. Planning and Training - Provides training, communications, and logistics for the Bureau of Fire. The Training\n\nAcademy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of",
      "Academy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of\n\nfire suppression, apparatus driving operations, emergency medical responder, hazardous material, technical\n\nrescue, vehicle rescue, and disaster response topics.

All new recruits must complete 32 weeks of basic training before being\n\nassigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for\n\nall members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City\n\nprograms such as the Civic Leadership Academy.

    "question": "When was coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]\n\nSteel City (1859\u20131946)\n\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Scots Irish leadership\n\nIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36]\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37]\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]\n\nIndustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]",
      "In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]\n\nThe third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]\n\nProhibition\n\nDuring the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]\n\nThe last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]\n\nIn November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]\n\nTo escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]\n\nHigh culture",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45]\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\u00a0million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[48]\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development.",
      "ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh. Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881. While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced. The union of the two men cemented their dominance over the Pittsburgh steel industry, and led to the eventual formation of United States Steel. In 1892, a labor dispute between Homestead Steel\u2014the nation\u2019s largest producer of steel, owned by Frick and Carnegie\u2014and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers\u2014its largest craft union\u2014escalated into a major, violent event. That summer, with Carnegie out of the country and the dispute still unresolved, Frick closed the mill, locking out 3,800 workers and intending to replace them with non-union employees. The union workers then seized the mill. Frick, in return, arranged for 300 armed Pinkerton detectives to travel by boat down the Ohio River, enter the mill on the river side and reclaim the building. Almost as soon as the detectives arrived, fighting began between both sides, resulting in loss of life for both steelworkers and Pinkerton detectives. It lasted for 12 hours, and eventually the Pennsylvania National Guard was ordered by the governor to intercede. The mill was secured and Homestead was placed under martial law. Henry Clay Frick showed an early interest in collecting paintings and drawings. In 1871, he applied for a loan of $10,000 from the bank of T. Mellon & Sons. The agent from the bank who was sent to investigate Frick\u2019s reliability commented that Frick \u201cmay be a little too enthusiastic about pictures, but not enough to hurt.\u201d By 1881 Frick had the resources to begin forming an art collection. His first recorded purchase of a painting was in February of that year. Frick chose a wooded landscape by local artist George Hetzel, who was a member of the Scalp Level School\u2014a group of regional painters who traveled to the countryside to sketch and paint in the manner of the French Barbizon School. Not long after that, Frick purchased other works, including At the Louvre (Une R\u00e9v\u00e9lation) by Spanish artist Luis Jim\u00e9nez y Aranda, a humorous, anecdotal painting of a young woman and her chaperone confronting a classical statue in the Louvre. Around 1885, after the Frick family was well-settled in Clayton, Frick began collecting in earnest. Much of this early purchasing focuses on French landscape painters of the Barbizon School, including Dessous de Bois (The Forest Floor) by Th\u00e9odore"

      "TITLE: Pittsburgh Penguins Contribute $500,000 to Renovate Ammon Recreation Center in Hill District | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins today announced a $500,000 investment to support a full refurbishment of the Ammon Recreation Center in the Hill District, ensuring the facility continues to serve as a vital hub for youth and community programs. The funding will contribute to a city-led renovation project that will modernize the center, preserve its historic significance, and expand resources for local families. \u201cWe know Ammon has been a cornerstone of the Hill District for generations, and we want to make sure it stays that way,\u201d said Penguins Alternate Governor Teddy Werner. \u201cStrong communities are built around places like this \u2013 where kids play, families gather, and neighbors connect. This investment is about preserving an institution that means so much to this neighborhood and ensuring it continues to serve future generations.\u201d\n\nLocated just a few blocks from PPG Paints Arena, the Ammon Recreation Center has long been a cornerstone of the Hill District, offering sports, educational programs, and a space for community events. Built in the 1940\u2019s on the site of the historic Ammon Field, the facility has provided generations of residents with opportunities to grow, connect, and take pride in their neighborhood. This latest investment builds on the Penguins\u2019 previous $100,000 contribution in 2020, which helped establish a Rec2Tech computer lab to bridge the digital divide for local students and families. The Penguins\u2019 commitment to Ammon is part of a broader strategy to support economic and community development in the region. Over the years, the team has worked with partners to help secure funding for Frankie Pace Park, contribute millions to the Greater Hill District Reinvestment Fund, and allocate significant contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses through major projects like the recently-opened FNB Financial Center and the forthcoming Music Venue development. ================================================================================\n\nURL: https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/pittsburgh-pennies-legacy-lives-on\n\nTITLE: Pittsburgh Pennies Legacy Lives On | Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nCONTENT:\n\nMembers of the original Pittsburgh Pennies, established in 1972 as the city\u2019s first women\u2019s hockey team, were in the building on Sunday for the seventh annual Her Hockey Game presented by 84 Lumber \u2013 which recognized the incredible passion of women fans during the NHL\u2019s Celebrating Women\u2019s History Month.

    "question": "What measures have been implemented in Public Safety to prevent the spread of COVID-19?",
    "context": [
      "Multiple others have been placed in quarantine out of an abundance of caution in order to stop the spread, including about 100 Police officers. \u201cThe number fluctuates daily, but understand that those who are in quarantine are not positive. They are off as a precaution,\u201d Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said Tuesday. \u201cAll but one of the (positive) employees are recuperating at home. One was hospitalized, but has been improving daily. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected.\u201d\n\nPublic Safety\u2019s positive test rates remain significantly lower that what other major city First Responders are experiencing. The low infection rates\u00a0have\u00a0allowed Public Safety to proactively quarantine everyone who was possibly exposed, and to maintain normal staffing levels. \u201cWhen you call 911, rest assured you\u2019re going to get the assistance you need,\u201d Hissrich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going a step above what is required. Our numbers have been so low that we can take these precautions. \u2026 We have to be cautious and we have to make sure our First Responders have the equipment and the training they need to respond to every call.\u201d\n\nSeveral preventative steps are in place across all Public Safety bureaus, and have been since March, including: Mandatory masks and social distancing, daily screenings upon entry to any Public Safety facility, and strict quarantine/isolation procedures. EMS, Fire and Police officials meet daily via Teams Meetings with Director Hissrich and the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth, to discuss the pandemic. EMS has reactivated a second specialized EMS unit with enhanced decontamination capabilities and advanced PPE to respond to suspected Covid cases. \u201cWe\u2019re taking all the precautions we can,\u201d Hissrich said.",
      "PITTSBURGH, PA (Feb. 27, 2020) \u2013 The City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Public Safety Department continues to prepare for a possible outbreak of Coronavirus in the region. Although no cases have been reported here -- the closest reported U.S. case is in Boston -- Public Safety plans for all possibilities at all times. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich began holding regular meetings to address Coronavirus concerns in early January. Those meetings continue. Public Safety\u2019s readiness plans include updating the city\u2019s 2014 Pandemic operational plan, which has been completed. As part of that update, contingency plans were added to ensure additional EMS personnel and units if necessary. In addition, First Responders have been trained to identify possible cases of Coronavirus, and to take steps to provide medical care or isolate patients if necessary. As part of that training, First Responders were provided with enhanced personal protection kits that contain face masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and protective eyewear to be worn in the event they encounter someone with the virus. To achieve operational readiness, the city is checking all EMS vehicles, including ambulances, to ensure they are working properly. City officials have also reached out to local hospitals and Allegheny County and suburban public safety officials to coordinate preparedness and response plans. Citizens can do their part in simple ways, most importantly by washing their hands often. \u201cThis is about being prepared,\u201d Director Hissrich said.",
      "Police Command Staff is in daily contact with the officers and their families. No one from EMS, Animal Care & Control or Emergency Management has tested positive for the virus. \u201cOther departments have seen 10, 15, even 20 percent of their personnel become ill, but we have so far avoided anything like that,\u201d Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. \u201cThis virus is volatile and dangerous, but we have implemented numerous measures that we hope will continue to keep our numbers as low as possible.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Public Safety personnel have been issued masks to be worn at all times while in public. First Responders\u2019 are screened before entering facilities and anyone with a fever or any other symptom is sent home. In addition, social distancing is being observed at all times possible. One Environmental Services worker sadly died of COVID-19 this week. A second employee who tested positive has not yet returned to work. Note: The numbers of personnel being tested, self-isolations, self-quarantines and other COVID-19-related actions fluctuate daily, and as such Public Safety and the City will provide weekly updates on positive tests but cannot accommodate daily inquiries. PITTSBURGH, PA (May 19, 2020) -- During National Emergency Medical Services Week, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS received recogntion today from the Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council\u00a0for its ongoing\u00a0commitment to\u00a0delivering high-quality\u00a0pediatric\u00a0emergency care in the City of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS completed Pennsylvania's Pediatric Voluntary Recognition Program (PVRP)\u00a0to ensure that all children receive the best possible prehospital emergency care. The multi-faceted program requires EMS agencies to complete five requirements\u00a0that build from the basic to the expert level. The Council's\u00a0EMS for Children Program Manager, Duane Spencer, recognized the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS for its successful completion of the expert level. EMS Chief Ron Romano received the offical certification on behalf of the Bureau, calling it a great honor. \"Many thanks to the paramedics who are out there doing this every day and making this accomplishment happen and for making us all proud,\" said Romano. EMS District Chief Jeffrey Meyer was also recognized as\u00a0the program's Pediatric Emergency Care Coordinator\u00a0who will assist the Bureau in preparing for calls for service involving pediatric patients through ongoing education and training, quality improvement,\u00a0community engagement and preparedness, and clinical care. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich acknowledged the evolution of Pittsburgh EMS over the years, as it\u00a0improves on skills with thousands of hours of advanced\u00a0training to include things like pediatric care. Hissrich said,\u00a0\"I think it's very important that we've expanded our role not only from the response by EMS, but to prevention, and hopefully that will continue.\"",
      "Maintain proper physical distancing. Wear a mask. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds often. Avoid large crowds. Stay home if you\u2019re not feeling well. In other words, all of the advice health experts have been repeating for months, follow them. Allegheny County is experiencing a spike in new Covid-19 cases. We can reverse this trend, but only if we follow the experts\u2019 advice.",
      "Please remember to look before you lock,\u201d Hissrich said. And finally, although the situation has vastly improved, the pandemic is not over. Those who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a mask. Even though the activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines. \u201cThis will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That\u2019s what people do during holidays."

The 2023 Tony-winner for best musical, based on David Lindsay-Abaire's play of the same title, revolves around a teenage girl named Kimberly Levaco, who suffers from a condition that rapidly accelerates the aging process. Before she has had a chance to venture forth into the world as an adult, she finds herself turning into an old woman. Her story, unfolding like a dark fairy tale, is as whimsical as it is piercing. Yet the effect is powerfully life-affirming in the way it reminds audiences of the preciousness of the time we have at hand.
