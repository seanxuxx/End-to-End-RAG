The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh.

The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.\n\nAfter the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881."

They left with a dark and foreboding image baked into their brains, painted in 1950 by the museum\u2019s chief artist, Ottmar von Fuehrer. The floor-to-ceiling mural took the Carnegie Tech-trained artist months to complete, and museum visitors got to watch as the depiction of the fierce creature took shape. Part T. rex , part Godzilla, the lumbering dinosaur was based on the science of the day. Later that century, scientists learned that T. rex moved with its back held almost horizontal, with its powerful jaws just a few feet above eye level and its tail raised well off the ground. So, von Fuehrer\u2019s mural had to go. But his work is still on view today\u2014from the painting of Mt.

The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season.[8] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[9] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[10] the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887.[11]"

My question is about Cameron Johnston: I had high hopes to see very improved punting from the Steelers at the start of last season, but then he was injured and done for the season. Is it reasonable to assume that he can/will be the punter in 2025? ANSWER: Cameron Johnston sustained a significant knee injury in the regular season opener, and that required surgery and landed him on the injured reserve list for the rest of the season. The injury was to Johnston's right knee, and that's his punting leg. He is diligent in his rehabilitation, but I don't believe there's any way to know definitively at this stage what his status will be for the 2025 season."
