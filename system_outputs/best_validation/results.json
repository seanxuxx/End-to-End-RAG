    "context": [
      "His 1998 trip to the Estancia Laguna Palacios was Lamanna\u2019s first international dinosaur expedition, and one that was transformative for him, personally and professionally. He developed deep friendships with the Argentinian paleontologists he worked with and began a scientific collaboration that has helped shape his career. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers,\u201d Lamanna said of his Argentinian colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m very much a guest on their project.",
      "Despite those efforts, much of the rocks there remain unexplored by paleontologists, making them ripe for new discoveries. \u201cIn the limited time I have on this planet I want to make the most scientifically significant fossil discoveries I can. I want to try to improve humanity\u2019s knowledge of dinosaurs as much as I can,\u201d Lamanna explains. \u201cIn my mind, the most likely place to do that is in the Southern Hemisphere continents.\u201d",
      "Lamanna, the museum\u2019s chief paleontologist, has taken many of these walks\u2014in Antarctica, Australia, China, Egypt, and Greenland, among other places\u2014and found the remnants of multiple new dinosaur species. This year, he returned to the place where his career essentially began: Patagonia, a region at the southern end of South America rich with dinosaur fossils. \u201cI get the question, \u2018Why would you go all the way to Argentina?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s really far away. Why would you go there when we have",

      "The answer is simple: Much less is known about dinosaurs from South America than those from Europe, Asia, and especially North America. For the past 25 years, Lamanna and his Argentinian colleagues have worked to narrow this gap, and to better understand the last non-avian dinosaurs to have lived in Patagonia. Argentinian scientists have been researching these kinds of dinosaurs for even longer. Despite those efforts, much of the rocks there remain unexplored by paleontologists, making them"
