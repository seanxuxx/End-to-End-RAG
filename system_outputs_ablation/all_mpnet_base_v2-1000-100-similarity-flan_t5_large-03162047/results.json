    "context": [
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]",
      "and formed a partnership, Frick & Co, with two cousins and a friend. The newly formed business used beehive ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh. Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881. While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced. The union of the two men cemented their dominance over the Pittsburgh steel industry, and led to the eventual formation of United States Steel. In 1892, a labor dispute between",

Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of",
      "Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]\n\nIron City (1800\u20131859)"

      "The event is one that is all inclusive, with something for everyone, from kids to parents. Included in the event were winter coats sponsored by RSM, health and wellness items and guidance from UPMC and American Heart Association, and Giant Eagle gift cards for grocery needs. \"The holiday season is really important to us, and we love to celebrate, but we also recognize that this is not always a time of celebration,\" said Holmes-Davis. \"There are still families out there that are struggling to put food on the table, to give their kids gifts and opportunities. It's an opportunity for us to give back and to support them.\"",
      "The group has done this the last few years to share with those in the community who are struggling during the holiday season, greeting everyone with smiles and boundless energy. Approximately 300 families were able to receive their Thanksgiving meal at the drive-up distribution held outside of PNC Park, with an assist from the players and staff. \"It makes the city know that we prioritize giving back, not only one individual sports team, but all three of us,\" said Holmes-Davis. \"Having a partnership just levels up that impact of saying all three of us are coming together because we know this is such a big need, but we all love to work together, we all love to do community stuff. \"Any time that the city can see all three sports teams come together, and more importantly our players, to be able to see them come together to serve people in their community, it's just a great opportunity.\"",
      "The organizations served during Huddle for the Holiday encompass an array of groups, but the one thing that ties them all together is a genuine need that exists today for a holiday lift. \"Something like this is spectacular because the people we serve don't normally get to do things like this,\" said Karen Triscas, a Navy Veteran and Certified Peer Specialist at Robin's Home, as well as a product of Robin's Home program. \"For them to come to the Steelers stadium, that in itself is amazing. We serve a lot of homeless veterans. For them to come here is incredible. It's the experience. The residential house we have, the women and children that stay there, this is awe inspiring for them. This is something immaculate for them to experience. It's so important and so festive.\"",
      "with community organizations to say, how can we streamline this, but how can we distribute 14,000 pairs of socks in our community. Then also to have space in your garage to make sure that you're able to house that. \"It's a great opportunity when we're able to honor people who are CEOs and in charge of different organizations and nonprofits. But it's also really important to make sure that we highlight community members that are taking time out of their day. They don't have to do it. They just do it to give back. They see a need in the community and don't look anywhere else, but say how can I help meet that need. We're really excited to honor her and just to let her know that we see her work and we support her fully.\"",

Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (\u201cVittoria!\u201d) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (\u201cVissi d\u2019arte\u201d).

Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario\u2019s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (\u201cVa, Tosca!\u201d). ACT II.In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (\u201cHa pi\u00f9 forte sapore\u201d). The spy Spoletta arrives.

Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.

Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]",
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company.

When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe.

In early July 1899, the crew stumbled upon a massive, nearly complete sauropod (long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur) skeleton. \u201cAround 150 million years ago, sauropods lived on every continent except possibly Antarctica. They ranged in weight from that of a horse all the way up to a sperm whale,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cThey were the largest plant-eating animals in a lot of the environments that they existed in. \u201cIn other words, [the team] had effectively found exactly what Andrew Carnegie was looking for.\u201d",

In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall.

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]",

The newly formed business used beehive ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh. Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881. While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced.

When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats.

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]",
      "Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)",
      "Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.[14][15]",
      "They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]\n\nAfrican Americans",
      "Contents\n\nHistory of Pittsburgh\n\nThe history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Ja\u00f6deog\u00eb\u2019 in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s."

      "(PITTSBURGH, PA) -- \u00a0The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police today addressed the marked escalation\u00a0in the number of homicides and non-fatal shooting incidents in the City of Pittsburgh this year. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, members of Police command staff, Gun Violence Intervention (GVI),\u00a0representatives from the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Community Outreach members, and families of gun violence\u00a0victims gathered at the Center for Victims on E. Carson Street. Year-to-date there have been 31 homicides, compared with 20 homicides\u00a0at the same time in 2020. There\u00a0have been 76 non-fatal shootings since January. \"I'm tired of going out to scenes and seeing families and communities grieving,\" said Director Hissrich. \"It's going to be a long fight and it's going to be a a very hard\u00a0summer for us, but I'm sure with the help of our communities and our partners, that we'll end what we're facing.\"",
      "As always, all emergencies should be immediately reported to 9-1-1. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2021) --\u00a0The recent surge in violent crime in the City of Pittsburgh is causing concern and even fear among some residents. Pittsburgh Police share that concern, especially as many of the victims of these crimes have been young people. So far this year, there have been 20 homicides in the City and close to 50\u00a0non-fatal shootings, marking 80% and 90% increases respectively from the same time last year. Pittsburgh is not alone in dealing with this, as the escalation of\u00a0violent crime is currently a national phenomenon. \"Although this uptick in violence appears to be a trend across the country, this is not our city. This is not Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will not allow this senseless loss of life to continue. Our officers will work directly with the community to get to the root cause of these crimes and stop them from occurring,\" Police Chief Scott Schubert said.",

    "question": "In which year did Pittsburgh begin producing steel?",
    "context": [
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
      "the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]",
      "control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared\u2014a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries\u2014though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important\u2014and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important."

      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]",
      "and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",

Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping.

    "context": [
      "But there was one love Mitchell always had, and race didn't impact it. He loved Alabama football. He would watch games on television with his family, or listen on the radio, and dream about the opportunity to go to Alabama and possibly play football one day for legendary coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant. Then, he witnessed what so many others did. On June 11, 1963, two black students, Vivian Malone and James A. Hood, showed up at to register at Alabama. Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway and blocked them from entering. Despite federal agents trying to intervene, Wallace didn't budge, and President John F. Kennedy ordered the Alabama National Guard to assist. Eventually Wallace gave in and allowed them to register. \"I can remember as a young kid when Governor Wallace stood in the doorway at the University of Alabama, not going to admit Vivian Malone and James Hood to the University,\" recalled Mitchell. \"Growing up as a young kid in Alabama in the 1950s and 60s, I saw a lot of",
      "So instead of taking advantage of the scholarship, and staying home and going to Alabama, Mitchell enrolled at Eastern Arizona Junior College to play football, where he received a scholarship. He earned Junior College All-American honors, and caught the attention of University of Southern California, committing to play for Coach John McKay. That never happened. Instead, his childhood dream came true. \"Coach Bryant was visiting Coach McKay at USC, speaking at his clinic, and Coach McKay was bragging that he had a black kid from Mobile who was coming to Southern Cal,\" explained Mitchell of how it all played out. \"Alabama never saw me play. Alabama had recruiters in the state. They called every John Mitchell in the phone book until they got my dad. \"They wanted to know if I was the John Mitchell who accepted the scholarship. Two days later Coach Bryant had a couple of coaches in my mother's home to visit with us to see if I wanted to go to Alabama. Two of his assistants visited, Pat Dye",
      "Everybody knew Alabama football.\"\n\nWith all of the excitement, also came a challenge. John Mitchell was now the first black player to play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. How he would be accepted, even if he would be accepted, by his teammates of course was on his mind. As was so much more. \"The thing that eased my mind, and I can remember it like yesterday, is we sat in Coach Bryant's office and he said if your son comes here, he is going to have some problems,\" said Mitchell. \"The only thing I ask of him is if he does have a problem, come see me first before he goes to the press. That is all I want.",
      "While at Williamson High School, Mitchell and four of his black classmates won an area science fair, then a state science fair, and then finished third in the country in a nationwide science fair. All five students were offered scholarships to Alabama or Auburn, but there was still a hurdle for Mitchell to overcome. \"All of us were offered scholarships to study engineering at the Southeastern Conference schools and all of the white schools in the South because that had never been done before,\" said Mitchell. \"I could have gone to Alabama or another white school, but I wanted to play football and Alabama wasn't recruiting black players then.\"",
      "In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today we look at the career of Assistant Head Coach John Mitchell, who was the first black player, captain, All-American and assistant coach at the University of Alabama. Like many young kids growing up in Mobile, Alabama, John Mitchell dreamt about going to the University of Alabama. But like so many young kids growing up in his Mobile neighborhood, at the time that he did, he knew that it was most likely nothing more than that \u2013 a dream. Mitchell was born in 1951, a time when there was segregation in Alabama and throughout the South. And it wasn't just in the schools where it was felt, it was everyday life where blacks and whites were separated, and he had to deal with every aspect of it. \"It was pretty tough as a kid growing up, especially right there in Mobile and the state of Alabama,\" said Mitchell. \"People talk now about"

      "5. Elijah Arroyo, Miami (6-41/2, 251 lbs.) - NFL comparisons have been made to Detroit's Sam LaPorta. Arroyo can stretch the field, he embraces blocking responsibilities and he was one of the standout performers during Senior Bowl Week. He's a player on the rise after accounting for seven of his eight career touchdown receptions in 2024. Sleeper: Jackson Hawes, Georgia Tech (6-41/8, 252) - Hawes' career statistics (51-566-6) pale in comparison to what more prolific pass-catching prospects amass in a single season. But former Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy considered Hawes the best of the bunch in Mobile, Ala. this year when it comes to in-line blocking. Hawes spent his first three collegiate seasons at Yale and showed he's passing-game capable if need be at the Senior Bowl.

Sleeper: Savion Williams, TCU, 6-4, 222 lbs. - He won't sleep long and he won't hit snooze. Not with the \"Wildcat QB\" component Williams will bring to his eventual NFL team.

He's an explosive, high-volume runner. Some might be scared away by his heavy workload, but Jenty was injury-free in college. He's tough and physical with breakaway ability. 2. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Teams looking for the next Jamhyr Gibbs might look to Henderson earlier than we might think in this draft. He's a home-run hitter with good hands.

Pruitt (6-2, 245) is a bit undersized, but he has played as a move tight end/fullback throughout his nine seasons in the NFL. Initially a fifth-round pick of the Vikings in 2015 out of Southern Illinois, Pruitt showed excellent athleticism at the NFL Scouting Combine, posting a 4.58-second 40-yard dash and 38-inch vertical jump.

      "After playing for the Vikings, Bears and Texans, while also spending some time with the 49ers, Pruitt joined the Titans when Smith was the tight ends coach in 2018. In 2022, he left Tennessee as a free agent and was signed by the Falcons, where Smith had moved as head coach. In 109 career games, 39 of them starts, Pruitt has 71 receptions for 748 yards and 12 touchdowns. In his past two seasons with the Falcons, Pruitt caught 25 passes for 260 yards and five touchdowns.

All four were on the Steelers' roster for the majority of last season, with Williams holding down a spot as a special teams player. Smith has liked to use multiple-tight end sets as a coordinator, meaning the Steelers could keep four tight ends again in 2024. Pruitt played 122 special teams snaps in 2023 for Atlanta, but Heyward and Williams were at 247 and 189, respectively, with Williams getting to that total despite being on the practice squad for the first four games of the season.

Since then, CC has organized more than 230 exhibitions and has established a satellite gallery [ 7 ] and a permanent collection. CC also offers a range of studio classes, community outreach programs, and a retail store. Elizabeth \u201cBetty\u201d Rockwell Raphael, who has been called one of the most groundbreaking women in the arts [ 2 ] was the first to transform the Pittsburgh arts scene. Before its foundation in 1971, Raphael opened a small art gallery in 1941 making the first modern art gallery Pittsburgh had ever seen. She introduced a new vision of art to the city and created what is now one of the only organizations in the country that focuses solely on craft media.
