    "question": "In which year was the first coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]",
      "the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the",
      "friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually",
      "Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]\n\nIron City (1800\u20131859)"

Iliza: The Get Ready VIP Event We could not have done the VIP event without these fabulous volunteers tonight! Diana coordinated the event with the volunteers! Congrats to Ruthie Fox! During our volunteer meeting we had the privilege of presenting Ruthie Fox with a medallion award and Circles lounge gift certificate as she was honored for the most number of hours volunteered in 2024!

      "The event is one that is all inclusive, with something for everyone, from kids to parents. Included in the event were winter coats sponsored by RSM, health and wellness items and guidance from UPMC and American Heart Association, and Giant Eagle gift cards for grocery needs. \"The holiday season is really important to us, and we love to celebrate, but we also recognize that this is not always a time of celebration,\" said Holmes-Davis. \"There are still families out there that are struggling to put food on the table, to give their kids gifts and opportunities. It's an opportunity for us to give back and to support them.\"",
      "The group has done this the last few years to share with those in the community who are struggling during the holiday season, greeting everyone with smiles and boundless energy. Approximately 300 families were able to receive their Thanksgiving meal at the drive-up distribution held outside of PNC Park, with an assist from the players and staff. \"It makes the city know that we prioritize giving back, not only one individual sports team, but all three of us,\" said Holmes-Davis. \"Having a partnership just levels up that impact of saying all three of us are coming together because we know this is such a big need, but we all love to work together, we all love to do community stuff. \"Any time that the city can see all three sports teams come together, and more importantly our players, to be able to see them come together to serve people in their community, it's just a great opportunity.\"",

      "The organizations served during Huddle for the Holiday encompass an array of groups, but the one thing that ties them all together is a genuine need that exists today for a holiday lift. \"Something like this is spectacular because the people we serve don't normally get to do things like this,\" said Karen Triscas, a Navy Veteran and Certified Peer Specialist at Robin's Home, as well as a product of Robin's Home program. \"For them to come to the Steelers stadium, that in itself is amazing. We serve a lot of homeless veterans. For them to come here is incredible. It's the experience. The residential house we have, the women and children that stay there, this is awe inspiring for them. This is something immaculate for them to experience. It's so important and so festive.\""

Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\nAs one of the country\u2019s largest and most respected natural history museums, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plays a critical role in both the Pittsburgh region and the international scientific community by conducting research and presenting exhibitions and programs that highlight the interdependence of humanity and nature, and advocating for the protection of the earth and its inhabitants.

      "Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as CMNH ) is a natural history museum in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It was founded by Pittsburgh-based industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1896. Housing some 22 million specimens, the museum features one of the most extensive paleontological and entomological collections in the world. As seen from the 36th floor of the Cathedral of Learning . Description and history [ edit ] The museum consists of 115,000 square feet (10,700\u00a0m 2 ) organized into 20 galleries as well as research, library, and office space. It holds some 22 million specimens, of which about 10,000 are on view at any given time and about 1 million are cataloged in online databases. In 2008 it hosted 386,300 admissions and 63,000 school group visits. Museum education staff also actively engage in outreach by traveling to schools all around western Pennsylvania. The museum gained prominence in 1899 when its scientists unearthed the fossils of Diplodocus",
      "The history of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth and diversification. It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building\u2014which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh\u2014his \u201cmonument,\u201d and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That\u2019s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International , second only to the Venice Biennale as the world\u2019s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum\u2019s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of \u201ccolossal\u201d prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover",
      "Adding two new museums Carnegie Museums\u2019 second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries , which gave Carnegie Museum of Art\u2019s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls : Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as \u201cThe Carnegie,\u201d and to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. Home to Buhl Planetarium , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and hundreds of interactive science exhibits, the Science Center now attracts more than half a million people a year. By the time of its"

Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]",

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",

Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city.

    "context": [
      "Fortunately, one of Carnegie\u2019s hired fossil hunters, Bill Reed, knew his stuff and ultimately guided the expedition to another place in southeastern Wyoming known as Sheep Creek. In early July 1899, the crew stumbled upon a massive, nearly complete sauropod (long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur) skeleton. \u201cAround 150 million years ago, sauropods lived on every continent except possibly Antarctica. They ranged in weight from that of a horse all the way up to a sperm whale,\u201d says Lamanna. \u201cThey were the largest plant-eating animals in a lot of the environments that they existed in. \u201cIn other words, [the team] had effectively found exactly what Andrew Carnegie was looking for.\u201d",
      "spied a drawing of a curious-looking skeleton hanging on the wall of the cigar room. Carnegie proceeded to tell the story of his prized namesake, Diplodocus . \u201cAnd the king offhandedly said, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019d like to have one of those in London, as well,\u2019\u201d says Nieuwland. \u201cAnd Carnegie then took it upon himself to make sure that he actually did get that dinosaur for King Edward. Because Carnegie was really keen on establishing himself the equal to all these kings and queens and so forth. \u201cSo Carnegie asked William Holland, who was the director of Carnegie Museum of Natural History at the time, whether they could find another dinosaur,\u201d says Nieuwland. \u201cAnd Holland answered with something akin to, \u2018Are you serious?!\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are photos from the unveiling where there are people shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d says Lamanna. Back in Pittsburgh, big things were in the works. \u201cMultiple sources cite the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and Carnegie\u2019s desire to display its mounted skeleton as a major driving force behind the construction of an expanded Carnegie Institute building,\u201d says Lamanna. In 1907, the greatly expanded building debuted with its Halls of Architecture and Sculpture, a spectacular foyer for Carnegie Music Hall, and a section dedicated entirely to fossils known as Dinosaur Hall. Diplodocus carnegii finally had a forever home. \u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d says Tom Rea, author of Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Dinosaur . The display of real fossils\u2014not just casts\u2014is what made it momentous, explains Rea. Before long, word of Carnegie\u2019s Diplodocus spread like wildfire. And everybody wanted a piece.

      "Andrew Carnegie\u2019s intense interest in prehistoric buried treasure began in 1898 when he spied an article in a New York newspaper about a University of Wyoming fossil collector who had stumbled across the ancient remains of the \u201cmost colossal animal ever on Earth.\u201d Legend has it that Carnegie sent the clipping with a $10,000 check to Museum Director William J. Holland with the directive to \u201cbuy this for Pittsburgh.\u201d The reality is that the check came later. First came a tussle between the university and Holland\u2019s team to remove the fossils. After no additional bones were discovered at the site, Carnegie\u2019s bone hunters moved some 20 miles away to Sheep Creek, Wyoming, where, in July 1899, they found a nearly complete skeleton of a gigantic, long-necked sauropod dinosaur. It would take all of 130 crates to transport the bones of the 85-foot-long giant Diplodocus carnegii \u2014named after its financier\u2014to Pittsburgh via boxcar.

They left with a dark and foreboding image baked into their brains, painted in 1950 by the museum\u2019s chief artist, Ottmar von Fuehrer. The floor-to-ceiling mural took the Carnegie Tech-trained artist months to complete, and museum visitors got to watch as the depiction of the fierce creature took shape. Part T. rex , part Godzilla, the lumbering dinosaur was based on the science of the day. Later that century, scientists learned that T. rex moved with its back held almost horizontal, with its powerful jaws just a few feet above eye level and its tail raised well off the ground.

    "question": "In which year was the first coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]",
      "the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the",
      "friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually",
      "Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]\n\nIron City (1800\u20131859)"

      "In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5\u00a0km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]",
      "Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]:\u200a289\n\nSawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents.[9]\n\nEarly colonization (1747\u20131763)",
      "Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.[14][15]",
      "They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]\n\nAfrican Americans",
      "Contents\n\nHistory of Pittsburgh\n\nThe history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Ja\u00f6deog\u00eb\u2019 in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s."

      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
      "the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there.

      "friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal.

Additionally, a 2022 Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission report on Equitable Broadband Access indicates that Seniors, Families with K-12 students, and Black citizens are disproportionately disconnected, and efforts should be taken to help these key populations. A coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions provided the Pittsburgh region with the opportunity to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come.

      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]\n\nEnvironment\n\nDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]",
      "the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the",
      "friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]"

    "question": "When was it unlikely for John Mitchell to attend the University of Alabama due to segregation?",
    "context": [
      "But there was one love Mitchell always had, and race didn't impact it. He loved Alabama football. He would watch games on television with his family, or listen on the radio, and dream about the opportunity to go to Alabama and possibly play football one day for legendary coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant. Then, he witnessed what so many others did. On June 11, 1963, two black students, Vivian Malone and James A. Hood, showed up at to register at Alabama. Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway and blocked them from entering. Despite federal agents trying to intervene, Wallace didn't budge, and President John F. Kennedy ordered the Alabama National Guard to assist. Eventually Wallace gave in and allowed them to register. \"I can remember as a young kid when Governor Wallace stood in the doorway at the University of Alabama, not going to admit Vivian Malone and James Hood to the University,\" recalled Mitchell. \"Growing up as a young kid in Alabama in the 1950s and 60s, I saw a lot of",
      "So instead of taking advantage of the scholarship, and staying home and going to Alabama, Mitchell enrolled at Eastern Arizona Junior College to play football, where he received a scholarship. He earned Junior College All-American honors, and caught the attention of University of Southern California, committing to play for Coach John McKay. That never happened. Instead, his childhood dream came true. \"Coach Bryant was visiting Coach McKay at USC, speaking at his clinic, and Coach McKay was bragging that he had a black kid from Mobile who was coming to Southern Cal,\" explained Mitchell of how it all played out. \"Alabama never saw me play. Alabama had recruiters in the state. They called every John Mitchell in the phone book until they got my dad. \"They wanted to know if I was the John Mitchell who accepted the scholarship. Two days later Coach Bryant had a couple of coaches in my mother's home to visit with us to see if I wanted to go to Alabama. Two of his assistants visited, Pat Dye",
      "Everybody knew Alabama football.\"\n\nWith all of the excitement, also came a challenge. John Mitchell was now the first black player to play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. How he would be accepted, even if he would be accepted, by his teammates of course was on his mind. As was so much more. \"The thing that eased my mind, and I can remember it like yesterday, is we sat in Coach Bryant's office and he said if your son comes here, he is going to have some problems,\" said Mitchell. \"The only thing I ask of him is if he does have a problem, come see me first before he goes to the press. That is all I want.",
      "While at Williamson High School, Mitchell and four of his black classmates won an area science fair, then a state science fair, and then finished third in the country in a nationwide science fair. All five students were offered scholarships to Alabama or Auburn, but there was still a hurdle for Mitchell to overcome. \"All of us were offered scholarships to study engineering at the Southeastern Conference schools and all of the white schools in the South because that had never been done before,\" said Mitchell. \"I could have gone to Alabama or another white school, but I wanted to play football and Alabama wasn't recruiting black players then.\"",
      "In celebration of Black History Month, we take the time to recognize and reflect on the thoughts and contributions of members of the Steelers organization. Today we look at the career of Assistant Head Coach John Mitchell, who was the first black player, captain, All-American and assistant coach at the University of Alabama. Like many young kids growing up in Mobile, Alabama, John Mitchell dreamt about going to the University of Alabama. But like so many young kids growing up in his Mobile neighborhood, at the time that he did, he knew that it was most likely nothing more than that \u2013 a dream. Mitchell was born in 1951, a time when there was segregation in Alabama and throughout the South. And it wasn't just in the schools where it was felt, it was everyday life where blacks and whites were separated, and he had to deal with every aspect of it. \"It was pretty tough as a kid growing up, especially right there in Mobile and the state of Alabama,\" said Mitchell. \"People talk now about"

      "5. Elijah Arroyo, Miami (6-41/2, 251 lbs.) - NFL comparisons have been made to Detroit's Sam LaPorta. Arroyo can stretch the field, he embraces blocking responsibilities and he was one of the standout performers during Senior Bowl Week. He's a player on the rise after accounting for seven of his eight career touchdown receptions in 2024. Sleeper: Jackson Hawes, Georgia Tech (6-41/8, 252) - Hawes' career statistics (51-566-6) pale in comparison to what more prolific pass-catching prospects amass in a single season. But former Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy considered Hawes the best of the bunch in Mobile, Ala. this year when it comes to in-line blocking. Hawes spent his first three collegiate seasons at Yale and showed he's passing-game capable if need be at the Senior Bowl.

That isn't \"Golden fast\" but it's fast enough for Burden to excel as a run-after-the-catch wide receiver and as one who is capable of taking the top off of a defense. Sleeper: Savion Williams, TCU, 6-4, 222 lbs. - He won't sleep long and he won't hit snooze. Not with the \"Wildcat QB\" component Williams will bring to his eventual NFL team. Williams caught  60 passes for 611 yards and six touchdowns in 2024. He also carried 51 times for 322 yards and six more scores. His NFL comparison in the eyes of some is Cordarrelle Patterson.

He's an explosive, high-volume runner. Some might be scared away by his heavy workload, but Jenty was injury-free in college. He's tough and physical with breakaway ability. 2. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Teams looking for the next Jamhyr Gibbs might look to Henderson earlier than we might think in this draft. He's a home-run hitter with good hands. While Henderson isn't the biggest back, he's outstanding in pass protection, a key ingredient to early playing time. 3. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton has good speed and runs with an aggressive nature. He runs extremely hard, sometimes to his own detriment. He could slow things down a bit to pick his holes better, but he has enough speed to outrun defenders and barrel over those he doesn't. 4. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State, 5-11"

However, the university retains discretion to report the conduct to an internal university department or authority such as Human Resources, Office of Community Standards and Integrity, or relevant academic department or dean to determine and implement appropriate responsive action, including review for possible misconduct under other university policies. IV. Reporting The university strives to create an environment where all members of the Carnegie Mellon community are aware of options for informing the university about instances of suspected Prohibited Conduct, how to seek assistance and support, and how to pursue university action for their own protection and that of the entire campus community. This Policy distinguishes the action of reporting from filing a Formal Complaint. Thus, information shared about suspected Prohibited Conduct does not automatically trigger formal action or an investigation, as discussed",
      "In these cases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will be rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the misuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was \u201cattacked\u201d by a Carnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an attack. Adverse Impact on Shared Systems The university reserves the right to discontinue communication",

Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students shall not in any way intimidate, reprimand or take retaliatory action against any individual who makes a good faith report of a suspected violation. Individuals who violate this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the university. An individual who knowingly or intentionally makes a false report of a violation may also be subject to disciplinary action.

Reports can also be made to the university officials listed in Section VIII who are designated with the authority to institute corrective measures. The university encourages all members of the Carnegie Mellon community to report to the Title IX Coordinator any information they learn about Prohibited Conduct. Sharing information of concern enables the university to offer support to impacted parties and protects the community from continuance of the alleged misconduct. Third parties should note that a report about possible Prohibited Conduct, including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, does not alone trigger a formal resolution process.
