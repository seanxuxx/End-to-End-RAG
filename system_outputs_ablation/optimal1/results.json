    "question": "In which year was the first coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J."

    "question": "In which year was the first iron furnace in Pittsburgh established?",
    "context": [
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached",
      "Iron City (1800\u20131859)\n\nCommerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]"

This initial collection was housed in Indianapolis in a small limestone building he called \"Foster Hall.\" Before his effort began, there had been no exact knowledge concerning the total number of Foster's works, nor any accurate literature published about the composer.

An astonishing 93% of the artifacts in the house are original, making Clayton a home more than a house, and an eloquent evocation of the lives of the family who lived there. Clayton has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors since it was opened to the public in 1990 after a four-year restoration. Henry Clay Frick and his wife, Adelaide Howard Childs, purchased Clayton in August 1882 for $25,000. At the time, the house was considerably smaller, an 11-room, Italianate-style building on a 1.43-acre parcel of land. The home, which fronted Penn Avenue in the residential neighborhood of Point Breeze, was located just a half-hour by train from Mr. Frick\u2019s downtown office. The couple moved into Clayton early in 1883, and soon had the first of their four children. Clayton is unmistakably a family home. A high chair sits in the breakfast"

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J."

The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains.",

In Buenos Aires, for instance, British residents founded clubs for cricket and a dozen other sports, but it was the Buenos Aires Football Club, founded June 20, 1867, that kindled Argentine passions. In almost every instance, the first to adopt football were the cosmopolitan sons of local elites, many of whom had been sent to British schools by their Anglophile parents. Seeking status as well as diversion, middle-class employees of British firms followed the upper-class lead. From the gamut of games played by the upper and middle classes, the industrial workers of Europe and Latin America, like the indigenous population of Africa, appropriated football as their own. By the late 19th century, the United States had begun to rival Great Britain as an industrial power and as an inventor of modern sports.

More often than not, however, politically and economically colonized peoples were motivated by emulation. Anglophile Argentines formed football teams not because they were coerced to play but rather because football was the game played by the English whom they admired. More recently, however, as transnational corporations have sought to sell every kind of product to every reachable consumer, modern sports have been systematically marketed to the entire world, not only as sources of pleasure but also as signs of distinction, prestige, and power.

      "Pittsburgh, PA \u2013 Mayor Ed Gainey announced that he has submitted legislation to City Council creating a Longtime Owner Occupant Tax Exemption Program (LOOP) , a transformative initiative designed to shield Pittsburgh residents from rising property taxes caused by soaring housing prices in their communities. This groundbreaking program would provide significant relief to long-term homeowners in neighborhoods experiencing rapid property value increases, preventing the displacement of those who have invested in and nurtured their communities. If adopted by Council, the LOOP program would ensure that Pittsburgh residents who have contributed to the character and vibrancy of their neighborhoods will be able to continue living in the homes they\u2019ve cherished, despite the pressures of development on property values. \u201cI\u2019m proud to submit this legislation that will help keep people in the houses they made into homes,\u201d said Mayor Ed Gainey. \u201cNo resident should be forced out of their neighborhood",

      "PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 14, 2019) --\u00a0City, Public Safety and Police Bureau officials gathered this morning in the Mayor\u2019s Conference Room to discuss the final 2018 statistics for homicides, investigation clearance rates and shootings. Over the past several years, homicides and shootings have trended downwards in the city of Pittsburgh. That trend continued in 2018. But officials warned that although the numbers represent progress, work remains. \"Every year since 2014,\u00a0we have seen a decrease in the number of homicides that have occurred in this city. That includes last year,\" Mayor William Peduto said. \"Our clearance rate has also increased, dramatically, and that is completely due to the work of Police. ...",
      "There were 71 homicides in 2014. The total dropped to 60 in 2015, 59 in 2016, 58 in 2017 and 55 in 2018. There were 174 non-fatal shootings in 2015, when Police began creating the\u00a0Group\u00a0Violence Intervention (GVI) Unit, which targets at-risk members of the community and offers guidance and services to escape a life of violence and crime. The number rose to 188 in 2016, then dropped to 140 in 2017 and 114 in 2018. Clearance rates hovered in the 50-percent range from 2014 to 2017, but improved\u00a0to 71 percent in 2018. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief Scott Schubert praised his officers, who take every homicide personally. He also credited residents for their willingness to work with Police, and said officers would continue to focus on removing illegal firearms from the streets. \u201cOne homicide is too many in the city of Pittsburgh, and we need to think about the victims\u2019 families and what they go through when someone is murdered,\u201d Schubert said. \u201cOur job is not done.

      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century\n\nIn 1901, J.",
      "By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air",
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]"

    "question": "In which year was coke-fire smelting introduced in Pittsburgh?",
    "context": [
      "Technology\n\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]",
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached",
      "It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and",
      "The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]",
      "By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air"

A Pittsburgh Bureau of Police zone officer recently tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in a number of other officers and supervisors being placed in isolation or quarantine pending test results or medical clearance.

Effective immediately, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich has suspended all in-person training programs and inter-unit rotations for Police, Fire, and EMS until after the election period. \u201cProtecting Public Safety personnel is of paramount importance at all times, but even more so during this pandemic.

    "question": "When was it unlikely for John Mitchell to attend the University of Alabama due to segregation?",
    "context": [
      "But there was one love Mitchell always had, and race didn't impact it. He loved Alabama football. He would watch games on television with his family, or listen on the radio, and dream about the opportunity to go to Alabama and possibly play football one day for legendary coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant. Then, he witnessed what so many others did. On June 11, 1963, two black students, Vivian Malone and James A. Hood, showed up at to register at Alabama. Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway and blocked them from entering. Despite federal agents trying to intervene, Wallace didn't budge, and President John F. Kennedy ordered the Alabama National Guard to assist. Eventually Wallace gave in and allowed them to register. \"I can remember as a young kid when Governor Wallace stood in the doorway at the University of Alabama, not going to admit Vivian Malone and James Hood to the University,\" recalled Mitchell. \"Growing up as a young kid in Alabama in the 1950s and 60s, I saw a lot of",
      "So instead of taking advantage of the scholarship, and staying home and going to Alabama, Mitchell enrolled at Eastern Arizona Junior College to play football, where he received a scholarship. He earned Junior College All-American honors, and caught the attention of University of Southern California, committing to play for Coach John McKay. That never happened. Instead, his childhood dream came true. \"Coach Bryant was visiting Coach McKay at USC, speaking at his clinic, and Coach McKay was bragging that he had a black kid from Mobile who was coming to Southern Cal,\" explained Mitchell of how it all played out. \"Alabama never saw me play. Alabama had recruiters in the state. They called every John Mitchell in the phone book until they got my dad. \"They wanted to know if I was the John Mitchell who accepted the scholarship. Two days later Coach Bryant had a couple of coaches in my mother's home to visit with us to see if I wanted to go to Alabama. Two of his assistants visited, Pat Dye",
      "With all of the excitement, also came a challenge. John Mitchell was now the first black player to play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. How he would be accepted, even if he would be accepted, by his teammates of course was on his mind. As was so much more. \"The thing that eased my mind, and I can remember it like yesterday, is we sat in Coach Bryant's office and he said if your son comes here, he is going to have some problems,\" said Mitchell. \"The only thing I ask of him is if he does have a problem, come see me first before he goes to the press.",
      "Putting on the Crimson Tide uniform. As a kid, he envisioned himself doing that. But he also knew what the reality was. He never imagined, a young kid from the other side of the railroad tracks would make history and be the first black player to wear the uniform. \"It brought tears to my eyes,\" said Mitchell of the first time he put it on. \"I watched Alabama play on television or listened to on the radio. Coach Bryant was a household name. He was revered in the state of Alabama. In the back of my mind, I didn't know if I could play for Alabama, if I was good enough. I took a chance. I wanted to go and know if I could compete. I didn't know if I could compete against them.\"",
      "During his time at Alabama, Mitchell never really thought about breaking the barriers. And honestly, it's not something he thinks about now. He doesn't look at himself as someone special. \"I tell people this, being first doesn't mean anything unless you do something with it,\" said Mitchell. \"I am happy that people recognize I tried to do what was right and made the path a little easier for them. That is the thing I am happiest about. A lot of times you get to be first, if you don't take advantage of it, not only are you disappointing yourself, you are disappointing people who want to come after you. I have had a lot of guys say you made it easier to come after you. \"That is the thing that I am proudest of. Not that I was the first African American to play, be a captain or coach. Those things are fleeting. But when people say you made it easier for me, that is where my joy comes from. \"When I was at Alabama, we had about 10,500 students and only 50 black students. Only four out of 144"

      "But he also averaged more than 6 yards per carry in each of his three college seasons, has good contact balance and is a solid pass protector. He looks NFL ready to be the thunder portion of an NFL committee, with the potential to be an every-down back. Matt's Take\n\nThis is a truly exceptional running back class and could be the strongest position group in this entire draft class. This group of running backs has a true superstar at the top of the list, plenty of projectable starters at the next level, great depth all through the entire draft, and a very wide variety of players at this position. The 2025 running back group has someone for everyone, but as the draft goes along, it might also provide excellent value on the third day of the draft. In fact, don't be surprised if several undrafted players at this position go on to have very successful NFL careers. Matt's Rankings",
      "2. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, * 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton is a big back with great bit play abilities as both a runner and receiver who runs away from defenders in the open field. This is a very physical downhill runner that delivers an awful lot of contact. His pass protection skills could use more work and Hampton isn't the shiftiest guy in this class, but he projects as a feature back at the next level. 3. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Henderson was fantastic in the college playoffs this season and is a big play waiting to happen every time he touches the football. While he probably doesn't project to a high-carry workhorse role in the league, Henderson will give his new team an immediate jolt. Henderson has good size for a back with his dynamism while also excelling in pass protection. 4. Kaleb Johnson, Iowa, 6-1, 224 lbs. - Johnson is coming off a big season for the Hawkeyes. He is extremely well built but can run a little bit high at times.",

      "1. Ashton Jenty, Boise State, 5-8 1/2, 211 lbs. - An elite talent at the college level, Jenty quite literally carried Boise State into the college playoffs. He's an explosive, high-volume runner. Some might be scared away by his heavy workload, but Jenty was injury-free in college. He's tough and physical with breakaway ability. 2. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State, 5-10 1/8, 202 lbs. - Teams looking for the next Jamhyr Gibbs might look to Henderson earlier than we might think in this draft. He's a home-run hitter with good hands. While Henderson isn't the biggest back, he's outstanding in pass protection, a key ingredient to early playing time. 3. Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, 5-11 3/4, 221 lbs. - Hampton has good speed and runs with an aggressive nature. He runs extremely hard, sometimes to his own detriment. He could slow things down a bit to pick his holes better, but he has enough speed to outrun defenders and barrel over those he doesn't. 4. Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State, 5-11"

Is it reasonable to assume that he can/will be the punter in 2025? ANSWER: Cameron Johnston sustained a significant knee injury in the regular season opener, and that required surgery and landed him on the injured reserve list for the rest of the season. The injury was to Johnston's right knee, and that's his punting leg. He is diligent in his rehabilitation, but I don't believe there's any way to know definitively at this stage what his status will be for the 2025 season.

But I hear they have a wide receiver, Garrett Wilson, who wants out.",
      "The native of Australia has a big leg, as evidenced by his career 47.3-yard net average. But he's also been good kicking directionally throughout his career. In 2023, he averaged 4.25 seconds of hang time on his punts, which ranked 28th in the NFL, but his net average of 44.0 yards last season was fourth-highest in the NFL. Johnston also placed 30 of his 66 punts a year ago inside the opposing 20, which tied for seventh-most in the NFL.
